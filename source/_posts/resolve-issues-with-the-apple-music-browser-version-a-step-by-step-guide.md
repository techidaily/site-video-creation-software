## Fix Apple Music Web Player not Playing on Windows & macOS Browser

With Apple ID and Apple Music account signed in, the full length singles like Humility by Gorillaz can be easily tuned in instead of a preview 20s version. However, when I try clicking a playlist under the "New Music Playlists" for listening to Songs of the Summer in loops, there's no playlists interface coming out. No matter how many times I refreshed the interface, restarted the Chrome browser, changed a browser and re-login-in, there is a big nothing hanging on the web page. 

The actual fact is that Apple Music Web Player does not support playlist playback from Windows and macOS web browsers, yet. To use Apple Music Web Player, you need to switch to a mobile device! And the mobile device is also restricted to iOS device for now.
