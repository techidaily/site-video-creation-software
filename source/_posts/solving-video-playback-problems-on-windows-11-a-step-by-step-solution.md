## Possible Reasons of Windows 10 Video Player Errors:

Besides Windows Media Player, people also downloaded some other third-party [video player on Windows 10](https://tools.techidaily.com/5kplayer/video-music-player/) to cover the problem that somethings Windows Media Player stopped work. Such video players as VLC, KMPlayer, GOM Player, SM Player, etc. Before finding the solution of video player not working on Windows 10, let's first dig out the reasons. 

**1\. Video Player not updated to be compatible with Windows 10\.** 

Well, for the first possible reason, if the Windows 10 video player you are using is the latest version already, then you probably need to get an alternative since the video player is not working on Windows 10 at all, or else you need to update your default video player for Windows 10 to the latest version and then try it out. 

**2\. Video formats not natively supported by Windows 10 or the video Player.** 

Videos formats like WMV, AVI, MOV, etc. are natively supported by Windows 10 if you updated Windows Media Player to version 12, but MP4, MKV, FLV files rely on different codecs to work on Windows 10 properly. So if you didn't have the codecs installed or there is no third-party video player to open those files, you won't be able to play all the MP4, MKV, FLV files on your Windows 10 PC.

**3\. Incorrect power plan settings in Control Panel on Windows 10.**

Power Plans are just a different group of settings that manages how your computer uses and conserves power while operating the system instruction. Playing high-res video up to 4K or more even takes up over 90% CPU usage, therefore, choose High Performance of Power Plans might increase PC performance and responsiveness.

**4\. Bugs on Windows 10 or the video player.** 

In this case, you should contact the support of Windows 10 or the video player you are stick-on, they will normally value the bugs report that their users send to them. Once it fixed, you will be able to play the video files you want on Windows 10 again. 

**5\. Data corruption on the video file or player file.** 

Right-click on the video file you want to open, check the properties. If it shows the video file size is 0.00 MB or much smaller than it should be, you might save file in wrong data or the video is damaged. Also, if you meet the flashback problem, you should check if the player file is damaged.
