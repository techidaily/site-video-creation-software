Part 2\. How to Use Cloud Stop Motion to Create Animation Videos?

Cloud Stop Motion is a great browser-based app that one can use to create fun animation videos. You can use Cloud Stop Motion even when you have not created your account. But consider creating an account to enjoy additional features.

![cloud stop motion](https://images.wondershare.com/filmora/article-images/2021/cloud-stop-motion.jpg)

Before you open Cloud Stop Motion and start clicking pictures of your subject for your video, it is important to have a story in mind. So, create a storyboard to break down your stop motion video. You can sketch your plan frame by frame or write bulleted list of your frames. It will help you create your project efficiently, ensuring that you have taken pictures of all the frames that you need to tell your story.

![adding new project on cloud stop motion](https://images.wondershare.com/filmora/article-images/2021/adding-new-project-on-cloud-stop-motion.jpg)

Step 1: Once you have created your storyboard, open the app to go to the Cloud Stop Motion dashboard. Click on the new project button. Cloud Stop Motion needs access to your camera for capturing images. So, allow camera access.

![allowing access to camera on cloud stop motion](https://images.wondershare.com/filmora/article-images/2021/allowing-access-to-camera-on-cloud-stop-motion.jpg)

On the dashboard, go to the taking picture menu. Now place the subject at the center of your frame. Capture a few test shots to find the composition that you like. You can see the picture at the bottom of the timeline. If needed, adjust the position of your subject. Make sure that the location you choose has plenty of light. If not, you also use a lamp for good light.

Tip: Keeping your phone or camera steady while making your stop-motion project is the key. You can use a tripod, a selfie stick, or a gimbal to keep your device as still as possible. If you don't own any of these, keep your device on something sturdy and make sure that you do not change its place until you capture all the images needed for your project. This way all your shots will be consistent.

Step 2: Move your subject or change its position and take a picture. Repeat the process until you complete your story. To make your stop-motion smooth, make small changes to the position of your subject between shots.

![capturing images on cloud stop motion](https://images.wondershare.com/filmora/article-images/2021/capturing-images-on-cloud-stop-motion.jpg)

You can also add more frames per second. Generally, you should add 10 frames per second. But you can go for 25 frames per second to make a smoother video. All the pictures you snap are automatically added to the editor in chronological order.

Step 3: Once you have captured images for your project, add sound by going to the sound menu in the top left of the dashboard. You can record sounds, upload sounds, or select sounds from Cloud Stop Motion's gallery. You can also add text to your Cloud Stop Motion project if you want.

Step 4: Click on play button to preview your project and see if your motion picture turned out as per your liking or not. If you do not like something, go back and make changes. Once done, download your video from cloudstop motion.

## Premiere Pro or Vegas Pro: Which Video Editor Reigns Supreme ?

# Sony Vegas VS Adobe Premiere, Which One is Better?

It's an age-old battle, [Vegas](https://www.vegascreativesoftware.com/us/) or [Premiere](https://www.adobe.com/products/premiere.html), a comparison that many have made over the last few years in the market, as always when making a comparison, things are always skewed by the writer's own views, so it is hard to draw any definitive conclusions.

Again the [Premiere spec-sheet suggests it is a close call](https://helpx.adobe.com/premiere-pro/system-requirements.html), and to be brutally honest that is mostly the truth. Premiere does have more ability within the editing department there is no question. There are very few things that Vegas does better (3D manipulation being the standout), but distilled into the bare bones of a list of 'things', so the differences are not so obvious. The usability factor for Vegas carries on into the editing process too, although it is perhaps inevitable that Premiere's more complex abilities lead to a more complex interface structure and a steeper learning curve, it is still a truth that Vegas is just easier to get results from at the start.

Underneath the [Vegas specifications](https://www.vegascreativesoftware.com/us/vegas-pro/specifications/) though, Premiere does have plenty going for it, the Mercury Playback Engine that drives the editing suite enables renders real-time playback that saves time and makes for a much smoother workflow for any project, and whilst it will not apply to everyone, the multiple camera abilities are second to none and for those that use them, an invaluable and significant tool for producing professional-grade output.

I keep returning to this point, but in a comparison of the two products it is a very important one, whilst ultimately Premiere has more ability within it for producing high-quality video, it is the learning curve that is [the major difference for new users](https://www.udemy.com/). This should be a consideration for anyone looking at the two, however, the complexity of Premiere is not an insurmountable issue. There are numerous tutorials, both free and commercial, available to get any level of the user through the first steps of understanding the processes within Premiere, and of course the same is true of Vegas, although to my mind they would not be as essentially an item, whereas with Premiere, the very least that is required is going through Adobe's own online video education for the software.

#### 2. Sony Vegas VS Adobe Premiere: Specification Comparison

As we can see at first glance the two seem very comparable regarding the basic tools and utilities. The one glaring difference does not mentioned in the basic specs outlined above, however, is that Sony Vegas is a Windows-only product. [Premiere has versions for both Mac and Windows](https://www.premierebro.com/blog/adobe-announces-windows-and-mac-os-support-changes-for-future-releases), and whilst the dominance of Apple within the creative industries is nowhere near what it once was, a sizable number of people still use the Mac platform, and for them, Vegas isn't even an option without resorting to emulation, which is a processor-intensive operation like video editing is not really a viable solution.

It is also important to consider that the spec-sheet itself doesn't tell the whole story, with the audio and [effect modules more advanced in Premiere](https://helpx.adobe.com/after-effects/using/effects-animation-presets-overview.html), however, Vegas has the benefit of being a much easier program to get to grips with for anyone new to the video editing world, and although its abilities are perhaps ultimately not as sophisticated as Premiere, new users often find they get better results with Vegas due to the accessibility of its tools. For the more experienced this is probably not a factor, but it is worth considering for newcomers.

#### 3. Sony Vegas VS Adobe Premiere: Workflow comparison

Once that initial barrier is overcome, however, I feel that the added functionality, workflow efficiency, and compatibility-out-of-the-box Premiere can deal with roughly double the number of [media formats](https://helpx.adobe.com/fi/premiere-pro/using/supported-file-formats.html) \- of Adobe's product makes it a superior product for long-term use.

The key here is long term, no one wants to relearn everything every couple of years, switching platforms endlessly searching for the ultimate product, so when making a choice for video editing I would always suggest that prospective users consider not just what they want now, but what they may want in the future. Vegas has the easier entry path, there is absolutely no question, however what if you later want the more sophisticated editing facilities? If you switch then you still have to go through learning Premiere, after learning Vegas. Learning one piece of software is a better choice, so which one will fulfill future needs should be taken into account.

#### 4. Sony Vegas VS Adobe Premiere: Compatibility Comparison

There is also the issue of other production requirements. If you are aiming towards motion effects, animation, and other composite effects within your work, then consider the platform that will be carried out on as well. Here is where Adobe's strength shines. The various products they put out work together extremely well, and [in the case of video effects](https://tools.techidaily.com/wondershare/filmora/download/), Premiere and After Effects together offer a workflow and output quality that is as good as it gets. Saying either will do the job is not really a satisfactory conclusion for these types of comparisons, even if it is actually true. However, there are answers here.

## Part 2: FAQ about Vegas

### 1\. Can Sony Vegas be used on a Mac?

Sony Vegas professional was not generally a SONY item, and it is not, at this point, a SONY item.

It was offered to Magix before this previous year. It was initially a DAW [Digital Audio Workstation](https://tools.techidaily.com/wondershare/filmora/download/) programming that had video highlights. After some time, it developed into the item a considerable lot of us know and love, Vegas Pro.

A hearty and expert video altering programming! SONY hoped to port Vegas over to Mac for quite a while. They had effectively discharged a Mac form of SoundForge, and Vegas would have been straightaway.

I surmise they ran into a huge amount of specialized issues, the greatest being that they just needed Mac programming abilities.

Apple additionally discharged FCPX as a $299 altering application for Mac, which removed any gainfulness from the condition for SONY. So that answers why Sony Vegas on Mac is impossible.

### 2\. Is there a Sony Vegas for free?

No, you do not get a Sony Vegas on Mac completely free at any time. However, there is a way in which you can torrent it or go for a free trial version.

Despite the option, the better suggestion for you is to go and purchase it instead of downloading it from anywhere else. It is because choosing the second option may lead to leakage of data from your computer.

Otherwise, you can also use alternative software such as Hitfilm Express or Lightworks. So, now you know that the Sony Vegas ‘Pro’ is just a faux term because there is no difference between the professional and normal version.

Both come at a premium cost anyway.

### 3\. How much does Sony Vegas cost?

There are [different plans of the Sony Vegas](https://tools.techidaily.com/wondershare/filmora/download/) such as Vegas Pro Edit, Vegas Pro, Vegas Pro 365, Vegas Pro Suite. The Vegas Pro Edit generally costs around $698\. Next, The Vegas Pro comes at the cost of $898\. The popular Vegas Pro 365 is priced at $16.67 for every 3 months.

So, you need to pay a total of $66.68 annually. Lastly, the Sony Vegas Pro Suite comes at $1098 and is the costliest of all the versions.

## Conclusion

In conclusion, Premiere is the more capable program, both in terms of workflow, output, and its ability to integrate with other applications to produce much more advanced output. For anyone looking for more than just an editor, it is the choice to make. Find some instructional material, dive in, and have fun.

This is a basic comparison between Adobe Premiere and Sony Vegas, which both are professional video editing software.

Again the [Premiere spec-sheet suggests it is a close call](https://helpx.adobe.com/premiere-pro/system-requirements.html), and to be brutally honest that is mostly the truth. Premiere does have more ability within the editing department there is no question. There are very few things that Vegas does better (3D manipulation being the standout), but distilled into the bare bones of a list of 'things', so the differences are not so obvious. The usability factor for Vegas carries on into the editing process too, although it is perhaps inevitable that Premiere's more complex abilities lead to a more complex interface structure and a steeper learning curve, it is still a truth that Vegas is just easier to get results from at the start.

Underneath the [Vegas specifications](https://www.vegascreativesoftware.com/us/vegas-pro/specifications/) though, Premiere does have plenty going for it, the Mercury Playback Engine that drives the editing suite enables renders real-time playback that saves time and makes for a much smoother workflow for any project, and whilst it will not apply to everyone, the multiple camera abilities are second to none and for those that use them, an invaluable and significant tool for producing professional-grade output.

I keep returning to this point, but in a comparison of the two products it is a very important one, whilst ultimately Premiere has more ability within it for producing high-quality video, it is the learning curve that is [the major difference for new users](https://www.udemy.com/). This should be a consideration for anyone looking at the two, however, the complexity of Premiere is not an insurmountable issue. There are numerous tutorials, both free and commercial, available to get any level of the user through the first steps of understanding the processes within Premiere, and of course the same is true of Vegas, although to my mind they would not be as essentially an item, whereas with Premiere, the very least that is required is going through Adobe's own online video education for the software.

#### 2. Sony Vegas VS Adobe Premiere: Specification Comparison

As we can see at first glance the two seem very comparable regarding the basic tools and utilities. The one glaring difference does not mentioned in the basic specs outlined above, however, is that Sony Vegas is a Windows-only product. [Premiere has versions for both Mac and Windows](https://www.premierebro.com/blog/adobe-announces-windows-and-mac-os-support-changes-for-future-releases), and whilst the dominance of Apple within the creative industries is nowhere near what it once was, a sizable number of people still use the Mac platform, and for them, Vegas isn't even an option without resorting to emulation, which is a processor-intensive operation like video editing is not really a viable solution.

It is also important to consider that the spec-sheet itself doesn't tell the whole story, with the audio and [effect modules more advanced in Premiere](https://helpx.adobe.com/after-effects/using/effects-animation-presets-overview.html), however, Vegas has the benefit of being a much easier program to get to grips with for anyone new to the video editing world, and although its abilities are perhaps ultimately not as sophisticated as Premiere, new users often find they get better results with Vegas due to the accessibility of its tools. For the more experienced this is probably not a factor, but it is worth considering for newcomers.

#### 3. Sony Vegas VS Adobe Premiere: Workflow comparison

Once that initial barrier is overcome, however, I feel that the added functionality, workflow efficiency, and compatibility-out-of-the-box Premiere can deal with roughly double the number of [media formats](https://helpx.adobe.com/fi/premiere-pro/using/supported-file-formats.html) \- of Adobe's product makes it a superior product for long-term use.

The key here is long term, no one wants to relearn everything every couple of years, switching platforms endlessly searching for the ultimate product, so when making a choice for video editing I would always suggest that prospective users consider not just what they want now, but what they may want in the future. Vegas has the easier entry path, there is absolutely no question, however what if you later want the more sophisticated editing facilities? If you switch then you still have to go through learning Premiere, after learning Vegas. Learning one piece of software is a better choice, so which one will fulfill future needs should be taken into account.

#### 4. Sony Vegas VS Adobe Premiere: Compatibility Comparison

There is also the issue of other production requirements. If you are aiming towards motion effects, animation, and other composite effects within your work, then consider the platform that will be carried out on as well. Here is where Adobe's strength shines. The various products they put out work together extremely well, and [in the case of video effects](https://tools.techidaily.com/wondershare/filmora/download/), Premiere and After Effects together offer a workflow and output quality that is as good as it gets. Saying either will do the job is not really a satisfactory conclusion for these types of comparisons, even if it is actually true. However, there are answers here.

## Part 2: FAQ about Vegas

### 1\. Can Sony Vegas be used on a Mac?

Sony Vegas professional was not generally a SONY item, and it is not, at this point, a SONY item.

It was offered to Magix before this previous year. It was initially a DAW [Digital Audio Workstation](https://tools.techidaily.com/wondershare/filmora/download/) programming that had video highlights. After some time, it developed into the item a considerable lot of us know and love, Vegas Pro.

A hearty and expert video altering programming! SONY hoped to port Vegas over to Mac for quite a while. They had effectively discharged a Mac form of SoundForge, and Vegas would have been straightaway.

I surmise they ran into a huge amount of specialized issues, the greatest being that they just needed Mac programming abilities.

Apple additionally discharged FCPX as a $299 altering application for Mac, which removed any gainfulness from the condition for SONY. So that answers why Sony Vegas on Mac is impossible.

### 2\. Is there a Sony Vegas for free?

No, you do not get a Sony Vegas on Mac completely free at any time. However, there is a way in which you can torrent it or go for a free trial version.

Despite the option, the better suggestion for you is to go and purchase it instead of downloading it from anywhere else. It is because choosing the second option may lead to leakage of data from your computer.

Otherwise, you can also use alternative software such as Hitfilm Express or Lightworks. So, now you know that the Sony Vegas ‘Pro’ is just a faux term because there is no difference between the professional and normal version.

Both come at a premium cost anyway.

### 3\. How much does Sony Vegas cost?

There are [different plans of the Sony Vegas](https://tools.techidaily.com/wondershare/filmora/download/) such as Vegas Pro Edit, Vegas Pro, Vegas Pro 365, Vegas Pro Suite. The Vegas Pro Edit generally costs around $698\. Next, The Vegas Pro comes at the cost of $898\. The popular Vegas Pro 365 is priced at $16.67 for every 3 months.

So, you need to pay a total of $66.68 annually. Lastly, the Sony Vegas Pro Suite comes at $1098 and is the costliest of all the versions.

## Conclusion

In conclusion, Premiere is the more capable program, both in terms of workflow, output, and its ability to integrate with other applications to produce much more advanced output. For anyone looking for more than just an editor, it is the choice to make. Find some instructional material, dive in, and have fun.

Again the [Premiere spec-sheet suggests it is a close call](https://helpx.adobe.com/premiere-pro/system-requirements.html), and to be brutally honest that is mostly the truth. Premiere does have more ability within the editing department there is no question. There are very few things that Vegas does better (3D manipulation being the standout), but distilled into the bare bones of a list of 'things', so the differences are not so obvious. The usability factor for Vegas carries on into the editing process too, although it is perhaps inevitable that Premiere's more complex abilities lead to a more complex interface structure and a steeper learning curve, it is still a truth that Vegas is just easier to get results from at the start.

Underneath the [Vegas specifications](https://www.vegascreativesoftware.com/us/vegas-pro/specifications/) though, Premiere does have plenty going for it, the Mercury Playback Engine that drives the editing suite enables renders real-time playback that saves time and makes for a much smoother workflow for any project, and whilst it will not apply to everyone, the multiple camera abilities are second to none and for those that use them, an invaluable and significant tool for producing professional-grade output.

I keep returning to this point, but in a comparison of the two products it is a very important one, whilst ultimately Premiere has more ability within it for producing high-quality video, it is the learning curve that is [the major difference for new users](https://www.udemy.com/). This should be a consideration for anyone looking at the two, however, the complexity of Premiere is not an insurmountable issue. There are numerous tutorials, both free and commercial, available to get any level of the user through the first steps of understanding the processes within Premiere, and of course the same is true of Vegas, although to my mind they would not be as essentially an item, whereas with Premiere, the very least that is required is going through Adobe's own online video education for the software.

#### 2. Sony Vegas VS Adobe Premiere: Specification Comparison

As we can see at first glance the two seem very comparable regarding the basic tools and utilities. The one glaring difference does not mentioned in the basic specs outlined above, however, is that Sony Vegas is a Windows-only product. [Premiere has versions for both Mac and Windows](https://www.premierebro.com/blog/adobe-announces-windows-and-mac-os-support-changes-for-future-releases), and whilst the dominance of Apple within the creative industries is nowhere near what it once was, a sizable number of people still use the Mac platform, and for them, Vegas isn't even an option without resorting to emulation, which is a processor-intensive operation like video editing is not really a viable solution.

It is also important to consider that the spec-sheet itself doesn't tell the whole story, with the audio and [effect modules more advanced in Premiere](https://helpx.adobe.com/after-effects/using/effects-animation-presets-overview.html), however, Vegas has the benefit of being a much easier program to get to grips with for anyone new to the video editing world, and although its abilities are perhaps ultimately not as sophisticated as Premiere, new users often find they get better results with Vegas due to the accessibility of its tools. For the more experienced this is probably not a factor, but it is worth considering for newcomers.

#### 3. Sony Vegas VS Adobe Premiere: Workflow comparison

Once that initial barrier is overcome, however, I feel that the added functionality, workflow efficiency, and compatibility-out-of-the-box Premiere can deal with roughly double the number of [media formats](https://helpx.adobe.com/fi/premiere-pro/using/supported-file-formats.html) \- of Adobe's product makes it a superior product for long-term use.

The key here is long term, no one wants to relearn everything every couple of years, switching platforms endlessly searching for the ultimate product, so when making a choice for video editing I would always suggest that prospective users consider not just what they want now, but what they may want in the future. Vegas has the easier entry path, there is absolutely no question, however what if you later want the more sophisticated editing facilities? If you switch then you still have to go through learning Premiere, after learning Vegas. Learning one piece of software is a better choice, so which one will fulfill future needs should be taken into account.

#### 4. Sony Vegas VS Adobe Premiere: Compatibility Comparison

There is also the issue of other production requirements. If you are aiming towards motion effects, animation, and other composite effects within your work, then consider the platform that will be carried out on as well. Here is where Adobe's strength shines. The various products they put out work together extremely well, and [in the case of video effects](https://tools.techidaily.com/wondershare/filmora/download/), Premiere and After Effects together offer a workflow and output quality that is as good as it gets. Saying either will do the job is not really a satisfactory conclusion for these types of comparisons, even if it is actually true. However, there are answers here.

## Part 2: FAQ about Vegas

### 1\. Can Sony Vegas be used on a Mac?

Sony Vegas professional was not generally a SONY item, and it is not, at this point, a SONY item.

It was offered to Magix before this previous year. It was initially a DAW [Digital Audio Workstation](https://tools.techidaily.com/wondershare/filmora/download/) programming that had video highlights. After some time, it developed into the item a considerable lot of us know and love, Vegas Pro.

A hearty and expert video altering programming! SONY hoped to port Vegas over to Mac for quite a while. They had effectively discharged a Mac form of SoundForge, and Vegas would have been straightaway.

I surmise they ran into a huge amount of specialized issues, the greatest being that they just needed Mac programming abilities.

Apple additionally discharged FCPX as a $299 altering application for Mac, which removed any gainfulness from the condition for SONY. So that answers why Sony Vegas on Mac is impossible.

### 2\. Is there a Sony Vegas for free?

No, you do not get a Sony Vegas on Mac completely free at any time. However, there is a way in which you can torrent it or go for a free trial version.

Despite the option, the better suggestion for you is to go and purchase it instead of downloading it from anywhere else. It is because choosing the second option may lead to leakage of data from your computer.

Otherwise, you can also use alternative software such as Hitfilm Express or Lightworks. So, now you know that the Sony Vegas ‘Pro’ is just a faux term because there is no difference between the professional and normal version.

Both come at a premium cost anyway.

### 3\. How much does Sony Vegas cost?

There are [different plans of the Sony Vegas](https://tools.techidaily.com/wondershare/filmora/download/) such as Vegas Pro Edit, Vegas Pro, Vegas Pro 365, Vegas Pro Suite. The Vegas Pro Edit generally costs around $698\. Next, The Vegas Pro comes at the cost of $898\. The popular Vegas Pro 365 is priced at $16.67 for every 3 months.

So, you need to pay a total of $66.68 annually. Lastly, the Sony Vegas Pro Suite comes at $1098 and is the costliest of all the versions.

## Conclusion

In conclusion, Premiere is the more capable program, both in terms of workflow, output, and its ability to integrate with other applications to produce much more advanced output. For anyone looking for more than just an editor, it is the choice to make. Find some instructional material, dive in, and have fun.

This is a basic comparison between Adobe Premiere and Sony Vegas, which both are professional video editing software.

Finding ways to show your feelings isn’t always easy. In fact, [buying presents](https://tools.techidaily.com/wondershare/filmora/download/) for those you care about the most, won’t necessarily reflect how you feel, so this year you can try making something for them.

**Creating a short Valentine’s Day video** shouldn’t be too hard, especially if you have a great story to tell. Besides, a video is something that will last, and your significant other will always be able to watch it no matter what the future brings. So, in this article, we are going to show you how to make a Valentine’s Day video on your Windows PC or Mac, or just with your mobile phones that will truly show how you feel.

## How to Make a Valentine’s Day Video on Windows and Mac

There are hundreds of [video editing software for Windows](https://tools.techidaily.com/wondershare/filmora/download/) and Mac computers you can use to create a Valentine’s Day video, but in this article, we are going to use Filmora as an example. However, each of the steps we will cover can be used in other video editors for Mac and Windows. Let’s check how to make a Valentine’s Day video with Filmora.

[![Download Filmora9 Win Version](https://images.wondershare.com/filmora/guide/download-btn-win.jpg) ](https://tools.techidaily.com/wondershare/filmora/download/) [![Download Filmora9 Mac Version](https://images.wondershare.com/filmora/guide/download-btn-mac.jpg) ](https://tools.techidaily.com/wondershare/filmora/download/)

### 1\. It all starts with an Idea

Creating any type of video without having a well-developed idea is virtually impossible because you won’t know which footage to use. Moreover, having an idea of how you want the final draft of the video to look will make it easier for you to select the footage you intend to use during the video editing process.

Once you know exactly what you want to do you can start shooting or collecting the footage you are going to include in your Valentine’s Day video. After you have all the video files you need, place them in one folder, launch Filmora, create a new project and proceed to import the footage by dragging and dropping the files to the editor’s Media tab.

### 2\. Organize the Footage on the Timeline and Enhance the Colors

During the next step, you should add all video clips you would like to use in your video to the timeline. You can do this by simply dragging a particular video file from the Media tab and dropping it to the desired location on the timeline.

![ Drag and drop valentines video footage to Filmora ](https://images.wondershare.com/filmora/article-images/drag-n-drop-timeline.jpg)

Optionally, you can use the Split tool to make cuts in a video clip and [remove parts you don’t want to include in the final version of the video](https://tools.techidaily.com/wondershare/filmora/download/). When done, you should right-click on each of the video clips you added to the timeline and select [the Color Correction](https://tools.techidaily.com/wondershare/filmora/download/) option. You can then proceed to fine-tune the Brightness, Contrast, Saturation, or Highlights values depending on how bright or vivid the colors in the original video are. This process can take a while, which is why it is important to be patient and go through it slowly.

### 3\. Add Romantic Filters and Elements

Filmora features Effects and Elements libraries that contain hundreds of different image overlays, filters, and predesigned elements you can add to your project. You just need to click on the Effect or Elements icons in the upper right corner of the screen to start browsing these libraries.

![ Drag and drop valentines element to video in Filmora9 ](https://images.wondershare.com/filmora/article-images/valentines-special-event-elements.jpg)

Once you find a romantic filter or element you want to apply to your footage, you should simply drag and drop it to the video track that is located directly above the one on which your footage is located. You should then position an [overlay, a filter, or an element](https://tools.techidaily.com/wondershare/filmora/download/) at the exact spot where you want them to appear in your video.

![ Drag and drop valentines transitions  to video in Filmora9 ](https://images.wondershare.com/filmora/article-images/valentines-special-event-transitions.jpg)

In case you want to adjust the intensity of an effect you applied you should just double-click on it and then use the Alpha slider to adjust the effect’s intensity. Double-clicking on an element you placed on the timeline will grant you access to the Video tab where you can rotate it, change its on-screen position, or set its Opacity value.

### 4\. Apply Text Layers

The Titles tab contains more than a hundred different Openers, End Credits, or Titles options you can use in all of your projects. Simply pick the one that best matches the style of your video, then add it to the timeline and double-click on it in order to start customizing it.

![ Drag and drop valentines texts and titles  to video in Filmora9 ](https://images.wondershare.com/filmora/article-images/valentines-special-event-titles.jpg)

Once you [insert the text](https://tools.techidaily.com/wondershare/filmora/download/), you can pick the font, color, or this size of the text, as well as set the spacing between two lines of text. Optionally, you can use Filmora’s Advanced Text Edit window if you want to have complete control over all layers of text you add to your video.

### 5\. Create the Soundtrack

Music will give your video the rhythm and it will make it more entertaining to watch, which is the reason why you shouldn’t skip this step. In case, you already have an audio file you would like to use as a soundtrack for your Valentine’s Day video, you can import it into Fimora the same way you would import a video file. You can then add it to an audio track and adjust its duration so that it matches the duration of the entire video.

![ add music for valentines video in Filmora9 ](https://images.wondershare.com/filmora/article-images/filmora9-audio-library.jpg)

You can also use Filmora’s library of [royalty-free songs](https://tools.techidaily.com/wondershare/filmora/download/) to create the soundtrack for the video you are making. Just head over to the Audio tab, pick a song from Electronic, Rock, or Tender & Sentimental categories, and add it to the timeline.

### 6\. Export the Video

When done with all these steps, you should preview the video you’ve created and if you like the results click on the Export button. You can then proceed to select the video format in which your video is going to be exported, choose the preferred resolution or the [frame rate](https://tools.techidaily.com/wondershare/filmora/download/).

Furthermore, Filmora lets you export all videos directly to your YouTube or Vimeo channels, which can save you a lot of time on uploading videos to these video hosting platforms. Nonetheless, how long the rendering process is going to take depends on your computer’s processing power.

![ Drag and drop valentines video footage to Filmora ](https://images.wondershare.com/filmora/article-images/drag-n-drop-timeline.jpg)

Optionally, you can use the Split tool to make cuts in a video clip and [remove parts you don’t want to include in the final version of the video](https://tools.techidaily.com/wondershare/filmora/download/). When done, you should right-click on each of the video clips you added to the timeline and select [the Color Correction](https://tools.techidaily.com/wondershare/filmora/download/) option. You can then proceed to fine-tune the Brightness, Contrast, Saturation, or Highlights values depending on how bright or vivid the colors in the original video are. This process can take a while, which is why it is important to be patient and go through it slowly.

### 3\. Add Romantic Filters and Elements

Filmora features Effects and Elements libraries that contain hundreds of different image overlays, filters, and predesigned elements you can add to your project. You just need to click on the Effect or Elements icons in the upper right corner of the screen to start browsing these libraries.

![ Drag and drop valentines element to video in Filmora9 ](https://images.wondershare.com/filmora/article-images/valentines-special-event-elements.jpg)

Once you find a romantic filter or element you want to apply to your footage, you should simply drag and drop it to the video track that is located directly above the one on which your footage is located. You should then position an [overlay, a filter, or an element](https://tools.techidaily.com/wondershare/filmora/download/) at the exact spot where you want them to appear in your video.

![ Drag and drop valentines transitions  to video in Filmora9 ](https://images.wondershare.com/filmora/article-images/valentines-special-event-transitions.jpg)

In case you want to adjust the intensity of an effect you applied you should just double-click on it and then use the Alpha slider to adjust the effect’s intensity. Double-clicking on an element you placed on the timeline will grant you access to the Video tab where you can rotate it, change its on-screen position, or set its Opacity value.

### 4\. Apply Text Layers

The Titles tab contains more than a hundred different Openers, End Credits, or Titles options you can use in all of your projects. Simply pick the one that best matches the style of your video, then add it to the timeline and double-click on it in order to start customizing it.

![ Drag and drop valentines texts and titles  to video in Filmora9 ](https://images.wondershare.com/filmora/article-images/valentines-special-event-titles.jpg)

Once you [insert the text](https://tools.techidaily.com/wondershare/filmora/download/), you can pick the font, color, or this size of the text, as well as set the spacing between two lines of text. Optionally, you can use Filmora’s Advanced Text Edit window if you want to have complete control over all layers of text you add to your video.

### 5\. Create the Soundtrack

Music will give your video the rhythm and it will make it more entertaining to watch, which is the reason why you shouldn’t skip this step. In case, you already have an audio file you would like to use as a soundtrack for your Valentine’s Day video, you can import it into Fimora the same way you would import a video file. You can then add it to an audio track and adjust its duration so that it matches the duration of the entire video.

![ add music for valentines video in Filmora9 ](https://images.wondershare.com/filmora/article-images/filmora9-audio-library.jpg)

You can also use Filmora’s library of [royalty-free songs](https://tools.techidaily.com/wondershare/filmora/download/) to create the soundtrack for the video you are making. Just head over to the Audio tab, pick a song from Electronic, Rock, or Tender & Sentimental categories, and add it to the timeline.

### 6\. Export the Video

When done with all these steps, you should preview the video you’ve created and if you like the results click on the Export button. You can then proceed to select the video format in which your video is going to be exported, choose the preferred resolution or the [frame rate](https://tools.techidaily.com/wondershare/filmora/download/).

Furthermore, Filmora lets you export all videos directly to your YouTube or Vimeo channels, which can save you a lot of time on uploading videos to these video hosting platforms. Nonetheless, how long the rendering process is going to take depends on your computer’s processing power.

Finding ways to show your feelings isn’t always easy. In fact, [buying presents](https://tools.techidaily.com/wondershare/filmora/download/) for those you care about the most, won’t necessarily reflect how you feel, so this year you can try making something for them.

**Creating a short Valentine’s Day video** shouldn’t be too hard, especially if you have a great story to tell. Besides, a video is something that will last, and your significant other will always be able to watch it no matter what the future brings. So, in this article, we are going to show you how to make a Valentine’s Day video on your Windows PC or Mac, or just with your mobile phones that will truly show how you feel.

## How to Make a Valentine’s Day Video on Windows and Mac

There are hundreds of [video editing software for Windows](https://tools.techidaily.com/wondershare/filmora/download/) and Mac computers you can use to create a Valentine’s Day video, but in this article, we are going to use Filmora as an example. However, each of the steps we will cover can be used in other video editors for Mac and Windows. Let’s check how to make a Valentine’s Day video with Filmora.

### 1\. It all starts with an Idea

Creating any type of video without having a well-developed idea is virtually impossible because you won’t know which footage to use. Moreover, having an idea of how you want the final draft of the video to look will make it easier for you to select the footage you intend to use during the video editing process.

Once you know exactly what you want to do you can start shooting or collecting the footage you are going to include in your Valentine’s Day video. After you have all the video files you need, place them in one folder, launch Filmora, create a new project and proceed to import the footage by dragging and dropping the files to the editor’s Media tab.

### 2\. Organize the Footage on the Timeline and Enhance the Colors

During the next step, you should add all video clips you would like to use in your video to the timeline. You can do this by simply dragging a particular video file from the Media tab and dropping it to the desired location on the timeline.
