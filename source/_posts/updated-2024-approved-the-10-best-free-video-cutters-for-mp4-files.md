#### 6\. [Free Video Cutter](http://www.freevideocutter.com/)

![Free Video Cutter](https://images.wondershare.com/multimedia/free-video-cutter.jpg)

One of the easiest to use, a simple interface and good performance.

#### 7\. [Freemake Video Converter](http://www.freemake.com/free%5Fvideo%5Fconverter/)

Whilst, as the name suggests, this package was designed for format conversion, it includes a wealth of other abilities, one of which is video cutting, it can also rejoin and merge clips too. As a video converter, it has the largest range of format compatibility in the list and can even burn your finished videos to DVD or Blu-ray for you. The cutting feature is nicely implemented into a clear interface and should be straightforward for anyone to use.

<!-- affiliate ads end -->
![Freemake Video Converter](https://images.wondershare.com/multimedia/freemake-video-converter.png)

An easy to use interface and a comprehensive feature set far beyond just cutting make this a great general video utility package.

#### 8\. [Movica](https://sourceforge.net/projects/movica/)

This package uses other open source scripting files as the mechanics of doing its job, and is in essence a user interface for those systems. That takes nothing away from it though, the tools it uses are very effective, but in their native form not something most people could take advantage of. In addition to MP4 there are several other video formats available as well as both .wma and .mp3 audio files.

![Movica](https://images.wondershare.com/multimedia/movica1.jpg)

A simple interface and a more technical outlook than many, but it works well.

#### 9\. [Virtualdub](http://www.virtualdub.org/)

A fairly comprehensive editing package, VirtualDub has a nice selection of cutting tools enabling accurate cuts and edits with ease, covering the MP4 format as well as several others, it is a useful tool for those looking for additional features beyond just cutting. Due to the lengthy feature set the interface is a little cluttered and for those that want nothing but a cutter, is perhaps overkill, however, it does the job very well and for many presents a useful selection of video tools.

With plenty of video tools in addition to cutting, VirtualDub presents an attractive, video toolbox for the enthusiast.

#### 10\. [Online Video Cutter](https://online-video-cutter.com/)

Our final offering is a slightly different take on the video cutter. This is an online offering that requires no downloads or installation, you simply go to the website, upload your video or select a video on the web, cut the video and save the output. It is very simple, although there is the obvious issue with larger files of upload and download time, but for many applications is perhaps the ideal solution.

![Online Video Cutter](https://images.wondershare.com/multimedia/onlinecutter.png)

Without the need to install anything, and with a very simple interface, for smaller files is perhaps the perfect solution.
