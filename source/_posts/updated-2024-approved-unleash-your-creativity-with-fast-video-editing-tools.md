![avi video rotators](https://images.wondershare.com/filmora/article-images/2022/07/avi-video-rotators-5.jpg)

Your video will be stored in the “Project Media” tab and will be visible next to the preview window.

![avi video rotators](https://images.wondershare.com/filmora/article-images/2022/07/avi-video-rotators-6.jpg)

**Step 3: Drag and Drop the Video on Filmora’s Timeline**

To rotate the video, first, you need to add it to the track. For that, take your mouse on the video, and select it by clicking the right button on your mouse. Keep holding the button to drag the video on the timeline. Remove your finger from the button after placing the clip on the track.

![avi video rotators](https://images.wondershare.com/filmora/article-images/2022/07/avi-video-rotators-7.jpg)

Right after the above step, you will get another message to help you decide whether you want to keep the resolution of the video to its original settings or match the media. Choose “Match to Media” for fast rendering.

![avi video rotators](https://images.wondershare.com/filmora/article-images/2022/07/avi-video-rotators-8.jpg)

However, if you’re a professional video editor, feel free to select the option that suits you the most.

**Step 4: Rotate Your Video with Filmora**

Double-click anywhere on the video that is already on the timeline.

![avi video rotators](https://images.wondershare.com/filmora/article-images/2022/07/avi-video-rotators-9.jpg)

You will see three tabs – “Video,” “Color,” and “Animation.” So choose the “Video” tab and click on the “Transform” option.

![avi video rotators](https://images.wondershare.com/filmora/article-images/2022/07/avi-video-rotators-10.jpg)

Once done, you will see three important options, which will help you rotate the video.

First, you will notice the “Rotate” option with an adjustment bar. This option will turn your video to different angles of your choice.

All you need to do is play with the adjustments by grabbing the “Round” knob-like button while keeping an eye on the preview window to see the results.

![avi video rotators](https://images.wondershare.com/filmora/article-images/2022/07/avi-video-rotators-11.jpg)

Just below “Rotate,” you will see the “Flip” option with “Horizontal” and “Vertical” mirror icons. Choosing any one of the icons will make your video mirror flip in horizontal or vertical directions.

![avi video rotators](https://images.wondershare.com/filmora/article-images/2022/07/avi-video-rotators-12.jpg)

The third option is “Scale” beneath the “Flip” option. Similar to the rotate option, this tool also has an adjustment bar. You can make adjustments to magnify or de-magnify the clip to fit the screen. Although this option isn’t mandatory, you can still use it if you find the need.

![avi video rotators](https://images.wondershare.com/filmora/article-images/2022/07/avi-video-rotators-13.jpg)

**Step 5: Save and Export Rotated Video to Your Widows or MAC**

Here you will learn how to save the project and then export it. If you have already saved the project in the beginning, skip reading this part and directly hit the “Export” button.

Contrarily, you can also directly export your files without saving the project. But you won’t be able to make changes to the same project in the future as all source files will be lost. Therefore, saving the project and then exporting files is recommended.

So, if you’re done with step 4, save your project before going further.

You can go to the “File” tab, choose “Save Project,” and rename the video.

![avi video rotators](https://images.wondershare.com/filmora/article-images/2022/07/avi-video-rotators-16.jpg)
