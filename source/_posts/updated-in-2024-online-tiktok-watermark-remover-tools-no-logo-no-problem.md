2. Find your favorite template by using the search tool. Select a template you want to add to your video slideshow and move to the next step.
3. Go to the Canvaâ€™s library where you can find a variety of charts, images, photos, icons, and illustrations. To add any of these graphics to your page, use the Drag and Drop tool. For clear images, use the photo effects tool.
4. Now, select all the images and illustrations you want and customize your slideshow using background, sound effects, font style, animations, color scheme, and animated sticker GIFs.
5. Once you have finished the customization, preview your slideshow and make sure everything looks perfect. If you are happy with the result, download the slideshow in MP4, PPT JPEG, PDF, PNG, or any other format as per your requirement. For live telecast, press the Present button or share the link on your Facebook or Instagram account.
