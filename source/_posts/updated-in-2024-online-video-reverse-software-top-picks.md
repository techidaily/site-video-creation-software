[Go to this page to check it out](https://www.kapwing.com/reverse-video) or either upload the video directly from your hard disk or portable storage media, or paste the URL from your favourite video playing sites like YouTube.

The one thing that really makes Kapwing stand out as an online video reverser is that you can reverse YT videos by URL alone. You can also use it to create montage videos and crop videos, among other things. Choose from reverse speeds between 0.5x and 2x, and enjoy the video trimming features that come standard. Kapwing even lets you try out a free sample just to see how the software works. Fantastic!

Pros

* Videos can be played and saved in the same resolution as the YouTube video quality
* No limit on the free usage plan
* Reverse YouTube videos directly online
* Trim videos, mute audio and adjust reverse speed up to 2x for exciting playback

**Cons**

* Reversed video length limited to 7 minutes
* Videos larger than 250MB cannot be uploaded
* Some YouTube videos are not accessible (for some strange reason)
* You must pay to remove the watermark

### 5. VideoReverser

If you’ve ever been remotely interested in a reverse video online editor, then chances are you’ve already heard of [VideoReverser](https://www.videoreverser.com/). It’s widely popular and used the world over as an online video reverser, offering compatibility with the most common video formats including mp4, mpeg, mpg, m4v, mkv, mov, flv, avi and others. You can set the output to any one of the popular formats like mpg, mov, mwv and mp4.

Much like the other online video reverser tools featured in this article, VideoReverser also works along the same premise: upload a file from a location on your computer/mobile device or paste the video URL. Select your output format, choose whether you want to mute the audio, and that’s it.

Choose from four different output formats, mpg, mov, mp4 and wmv, and click the Start button to view your video backwards.

**Pros**

* It’s super-free – as in, free forever!
* Option to remove the audio track entirely

**Cons**

* Files larger than 10MB cannot be uploaded
* However, sometimes, if you upload a video around even 3-4MB, it will give an “unexpected error”

### 6. Rocketium

Rocketium is another free online reverse video maker for reversing GIF or video files. Once the reverse file has been generated, you can download it to your desired location or share it across your social media channels.

Open [Rocketium](https://rocketium.com/is/video-reversing-tool/) in your browser, choose the ‘upload a file’ option or drag/drop media in the box under this option. Choose ‘download’ to save the reversed media file and you’re all done.

**Pros**

* Massive support for different file types – 22 to be exact!
* Save the reversed video either on your device or share it directly on your social media accounts

**Cons**

* Exported files will have the Rocketium watermark
* Some users have complained about the mobile version not being as robust as the desktop one

### 7. Movie Maker Online

Another fantastic and free reverse video online creator which requires no registration whatsoever. Furthermore, you won’t have to worry about any site labels or watermarks on edited videos.

[Visit the online video reverser’s page](https://moviemakeronline.com/a/reverse-video) and drag-and-drop your video to start editing. It’s fairly straightforward and quick. Save and download your video, and you can reverse it to your heart’s content!

Movie Maker Online is a fantastic introductory platform if you’ve no experiencing editing or reversing videos. Additional features include the ability to trim, merge and rotate videos. You can speed up and splice reversed videos and do joining and cutting according to the final result you desire. You can also add free music to your edited videos and a music fade in/fade out effect.

**Pros**

* Fantastic results without any watermarks
* Music fade in/fade out features not found in other online video reversers
* Preview feature helps you fine-tune output as desired

**Cons**

* Ads pop up expectedly throughout the editing process making it difficult to focus
* Uploading speed can be slow at times which becomes annoying when you just want to edit the video and quickly share it

### 8. Resizegram

No list talking about online video reverser tools would be complete without mention of Resizegram. Everything beautifully as you’d expect straight out of your browser like the other online video reversers.

Choose your [file](https://www.resizegram.com/reverse-video/) by browsing from your device or drag-and-drop directly. Resizegram supports videos as large as half a gigabyte, so if you’re planning to upload large files, it could take up to 10 minutes or more, depending on your internet connection.

While your file is getting uploaded, you need to keep your browser window open, although you can safely browse other websites during this time. If your file is taking longer than 30 minutes to upload, you’ll need to upload again as the video conversion process can sometimes get stuck.

**Pros**

* Preferred by many as a great free online video reverser tool
* All you need is a modern web browser and that’s it
* Very simple to use even for those who have never done any video reversing online
* Works seamlessly with iPhone, Android, Windows and Mac devices
* Option to manually remove files from the Resizegram server
* No registration required – just upload your file and enjoy

**Cons**

* Even though the 500MB file size cap seems generous enough, it may not be sufficient for some ‘power’ reverse video creators
* The upload process can be slow, especially the larger your file size is towards the above cap

**In closing**

With a myriad of free online video reverser tools to choose from, there are options a plenty for everyone – from the most basic of users to advanced users who love to create and market reversed videos for a living.

If the upload file size is an issue for you, for example, then you may prefer certain online reverse video makers over others. All in all, each one of the above we’ve reviewed should give you plenty of options to play around with, as you and your audience or friends get entertained over some reverse video silliness!

Boring and unexciting videos may turn off your mode. You need something special or wonderful that could turn you on and make your memories worth watching.

To let users give a new look to their pictures and videos, Apple Inc. released its first video editing software Final Cut Express in 2003\. Over the next few years, various improvements were made in its updated versions.

![Final-Cut-Express](https://images.wondershare.com/filmora/images/final-cut-pro/Final-Cut-Express.png)

However, after multiple inconveniences, Apple Inc. discontinued Final Cut Express in 2011 and launched its new version Final Cut Pro with advanced video editing features. Final Cut Pro was customized for video editing professionals with advanced knowledge of video editing. It is available for just $299.99 with 90 days free trial.

Some alternatives to Final Cut Express are also available in the market such as Final Cut Pro of crouse, iMovie, a low-end alternative, and Filmora, popular among beginners and pros. Let’s look at these tools individually in this article.

> * [Part 4: iMovie, Final Cut Express, and Final Cut Pro, Which is the Best?](#part4)
> * [Part 5: Best Alternative to Final Cut Express](#part5)

## Part 1: What is Final Cut Express?

Final Cut Express was a video editing software designed by Apple Inc. for advanced editing of digital and HD videos. It was a consumer version of Final Cut Pro liked by professional photographers, due to its better capabilities than iMovie.

Final Cut Express used to have many features like two-way color correction, dynamic RT, Chroma key, 99 audio tracks, split-screen, and picture-in-picture effects, motion path keyframing, 23 compositing modes, and opacity keyframing.

It also allowed the users to keyframe the filters and perform slide and blade edits. Eight years after its release, Apple discontinued Final Cut Express in 2011 in favor of Final Cut Pro X.

![fina-cut-express-update](https://images.wondershare.com/filmora/images/final-cut-pro/fina-cut-express-update.jpg)

## Part 2: Is Final Cut Express Still Available?

No, concurrent with the launch of Final Cut Pro X on June 21, 2011, Final Cut Express was discontinued and removed from the Apple online store.

You might be wondering what prompted Apple to do this. Well, the primary cause of the discontinuation of Final Cut Express was that Apple Inc. wanted to launch an advanced video editing software Final Cut Pro.

Besides, despite several attempts to improve the software’s performance, Final Cut Express kept on causing multiple inconveniences. The company eventually decided to discontinue Final Cut Express and introduce a new product to meet the ever-evolving needs of its customers.

As Final Cut Express withdrawal from the stage, many other editors still update to this day. For example, Filmora, an editor trusted by many beginners and pros, updates every month. Click download to try it for free!

Boring and unexciting videos may turn off your mode. You need something special or wonderful that could turn you on and make your memories worth watching.

To let users give a new look to their pictures and videos, Apple Inc. released its first video editing software Final Cut Express in 2003\. Over the next few years, various improvements were made in its updated versions.

![Final-Cut-Express](https://images.wondershare.com/filmora/images/final-cut-pro/Final-Cut-Express.png)

However, after multiple inconveniences, Apple Inc. discontinued Final Cut Express in 2011 and launched its new version Final Cut Pro with advanced video editing features. Final Cut Pro was customized for video editing professionals with advanced knowledge of video editing. It is available for just $299.99 with 90 days free trial.

Some alternatives to Final Cut Express are also available in the market such as Final Cut Pro of crouse, iMovie, a low-end alternative, and Filmora, popular among beginners and pros. Let’s look at these tools individually in this article.

## Part 1: What is Final Cut Express?

Final Cut Express was a video editing software designed by Apple Inc. for advanced editing of digital and HD videos. It was a consumer version of Final Cut Pro liked by professional photographers, due to its better capabilities than iMovie.

Final Cut Express used to have many features like two-way color correction, dynamic RT, Chroma key, 99 audio tracks, split-screen, and picture-in-picture effects, motion path keyframing, 23 compositing modes, and opacity keyframing.

It also allowed the users to keyframe the filters and perform slide and blade edits. Eight years after its release, Apple discontinued Final Cut Express in 2011 in favor of Final Cut Pro X.

## Part 2: Is Final Cut Express Still Available?

No, concurrent with the launch of Final Cut Pro X on June 21, 2011, Final Cut Express was discontinued and removed from the Apple online store.

You might be wondering what prompted Apple to do this. Well, the primary cause of the discontinuation of Final Cut Express was that Apple Inc. wanted to launch an advanced video editing software Final Cut Pro.

Besides, despite several attempts to improve the software’s performance, Final Cut Express kept on causing multiple inconveniences. The company eventually decided to discontinue Final Cut Express and introduce a new product to meet the ever-evolving needs of its customers.

As Final Cut Express withdrawal from the stage, many other editors still update to this day. For example, Filmora, an editor trusted by many beginners and pros, updates every month. Click download to try it for free!

Boring and unexciting videos may turn off your mode. You need something special or wonderful that could turn you on and make your memories worth watching.

To let users give a new look to their pictures and videos, Apple Inc. released its first video editing software Final Cut Express in 2003\. Over the next few years, various improvements were made in its updated versions.

![Final-Cut-Express](https://images.wondershare.com/filmora/images/final-cut-pro/Final-Cut-Express.png)

However, after multiple inconveniences, Apple Inc. discontinued Final Cut Express in 2011 and launched its new version Final Cut Pro with advanced video editing features. Final Cut Pro was customized for video editing professionals with advanced knowledge of video editing. It is available for just $299.99 with 90 days free trial.

Some alternatives to Final Cut Express are also available in the market such as Final Cut Pro of crouse, iMovie, a low-end alternative, and Filmora, popular among beginners and pros. Let’s look at these tools individually in this article.

## Part 1: What is Final Cut Express?

Final Cut Express was a video editing software designed by Apple Inc. for advanced editing of digital and HD videos. It was a consumer version of Final Cut Pro liked by professional photographers, due to its better capabilities than iMovie.

Final Cut Express used to have many features like two-way color correction, dynamic RT, Chroma key, 99 audio tracks, split-screen, and picture-in-picture effects, motion path keyframing, 23 compositing modes, and opacity keyframing.

It also allowed the users to keyframe the filters and perform slide and blade edits. Eight years after its release, Apple discontinued Final Cut Express in 2011 in favor of Final Cut Pro X.

## Part 2: Is Final Cut Express Still Available?

No, concurrent with the launch of Final Cut Pro X on June 21, 2011, Final Cut Express was discontinued and removed from the Apple online store.

You might be wondering what prompted Apple to do this. Well, the primary cause of the discontinuation of Final Cut Express was that Apple Inc. wanted to launch an advanced video editing software Final Cut Pro.

Besides, despite several attempts to improve the software’s performance, Final Cut Express kept on causing multiple inconveniences. The company eventually decided to discontinue Final Cut Express and introduce a new product to meet the ever-evolving needs of its customers.

As Final Cut Express withdrawal from the stage, many other editors still update to this day. For example, Filmora, an editor trusted by many beginners and pros, updates every month. Click download to try it for free!

Boring and unexciting videos may turn off your mode. You need something special or wonderful that could turn you on and make your memories worth watching.

To let users give a new look to their pictures and videos, Apple Inc. released its first video editing software Final Cut Express in 2003\. Over the next few years, various improvements were made in its updated versions.

![Final-Cut-Express](https://images.wondershare.com/filmora/images/final-cut-pro/Final-Cut-Express.png)

However, after multiple inconveniences, Apple Inc. discontinued Final Cut Express in 2011 and launched its new version Final Cut Pro with advanced video editing features. Final Cut Pro was customized for video editing professionals with advanced knowledge of video editing. It is available for just $299.99 with 90 days free trial.

Some alternatives to Final Cut Express are also available in the market such as Final Cut Pro of crouse, iMovie, a low-end alternative, and Filmora, popular among beginners and pros. Let’s look at these tools individually in this article.

## Part 1: What is Final Cut Express?

Final Cut Express was a video editing software designed by Apple Inc. for advanced editing of digital and HD videos. It was a consumer version of Final Cut Pro liked by professional photographers, due to its better capabilities than iMovie.

Final Cut Express used to have many features like two-way color correction, dynamic RT, Chroma key, 99 audio tracks, split-screen, and picture-in-picture effects, motion path keyframing, 23 compositing modes, and opacity keyframing.

It also allowed the users to keyframe the filters and perform slide and blade edits. Eight years after its release, Apple discontinued Final Cut Express in 2011 in favor of Final Cut Pro X.

## Part 2: Is Final Cut Express Still Available?

No, concurrent with the launch of Final Cut Pro X on June 21, 2011, Final Cut Express was discontinued and removed from the Apple online store.

You might be wondering what prompted Apple to do this. Well, the primary cause of the discontinuation of Final Cut Express was that Apple Inc. wanted to launch an advanced video editing software Final Cut Pro.

Besides, despite several attempts to improve the software’s performance, Final Cut Express kept on causing multiple inconveniences. The company eventually decided to discontinue Final Cut Express and introduce a new product to meet the ever-evolving needs of its customers.

As Final Cut Express withdrawal from the stage, many other editors still update to this day. For example, Filmora, an editor trusted by many beginners and pros, updates every month. Click download to try it for free!

## **Part 5: Best Alternative to Final Cut Express**

Now, as Final Cut Express is no longer available, you may want to try the other two editors of Apple. While iMovie mainly targeted beginners, Final Cut Express and Pro targeted users with moderate to advanced knowledge of video editing.

For those beginners who wanted to make professional-looking videos without any editing skills, Wondershare launched Filmora as an alternative to Final Cut Express and Pro.

This user-friendly made video editing as simple as ABC. From offering multiple hand-picked effects to advanced editing options, Filmora allows you to range markers, perfect your audio, group timeline clips, and perform detailed color correction with auto-correction and color wheels for free.

**Key Features**

* Advanced video editing options;
* 300+ free handcrafted effects
* User-friendly video editing tools; and
* Video conversion options to multiple formats.
