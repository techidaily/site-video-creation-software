 Mar 27, 2024• Proven solutions

The raw footage you record with your Smartphone or digital camera is not going to be saved in WebM file format. However, certain screen and [webcam recorders](https://tools.techidaily.com/wondershare/filmora/download/) can capture videos in this format, which means that you are going to need a video editing app in order to process the WebM videos.

Finding a [video editing app you can use for free](https://tools.techidaily.com/wondershare/filmora/download/) and that supports this video file format can be a daunting task. That is why we combed through the Internet in search of the **best free WebM video editors** you can use online or on your desktop computer. Here’s what we’ve come up with.

* [Part 1: Best Online WebM Video Editors](#part1)
* [Part 2: Best Free Desktop WebM Video Editors](#part2)
* [Part 3: How to Edit WebM Video with Filmora?](#part3)

Editing videos on the Internet has its challenges, as most online video editors offer only a limited set of video editing tools. Even so, the video editing software products we featured in this article provide you with all the video editing options you are going to need to polish your WebM videos before posting them on social media or uploading them to your website. Let’s take a look at some of the best **online WebM video editors**.

## Part 1: 5 Best Online WebM Video Editors

The complexity of the video editing tasks you want to perform is the best way to determine which online WebM video editor you should use. So, if you would like to create WebM videos in a particular style then you should choose an [online video editing app](https://tools.techidaily.com/wondershare/filmora/download/) that allows you to do much more than just trimming or resizing a video clip. Here are the five best online WebM video editors you can use for free.

#### 1\. [ClipChamp](https://clipchamp.com/en/video-editor)

**Price:** Free, pricing options start at $9.00 per month

Before you can start editing a WebM video with Clipchamp, you must first set up an account. This online video editor already has more than 7 million registered users, which speaks volumes about its capabilities. You can choose from a broad range of fully customizable video templates that are optimized for use on different social networks and save you time on performing the video editing tasks on your own.

Clipchamp features impressive stock audio and video libraries you can use to create soundtracks or as a source of complementary footage for your WebM videos. The free version of this online video editor only lets you export videos in 480p resolution and you cannot use the stock footage for free.

#### 2\. [WeVideo](https://www.wevideo.com/)

**Price:** Free, pricing options start at $4.99 per month

This video editing platform offers a broad range of video editing options, so you will have very little trouble turning your footage saved in WebM format into attention-grabbing videos. The video editing tools you will have at your disposal depending on the subscription model you purchase.

With the Free version of WeVideo, you will only have five minutes of publishing time, you won’t be able to export WebM videos in resolutions larger than 480p and each video you create is going to be watermarked. That is why you must opt for Power, Unlimited, Professional or Business subscription package if you want your WebM videos to really stand out on social media.

#### 3\. [Magisto](https://www.magisto.com/)

**Price:** Free, pricing options start at $4.99

Video content creators who post their videos on Instagram, Facebook or YouTube are going to love using Magisto. This web-based video editor is powered by AI that does all the video editing for you, which enables you to simply import the WebM videos you want to edit, select a video editing style and enjoy the results. In addition, you can choose from hundreds of customizable templates that can be used to promote a business or to create a Valentine’s Day video.

The duration of the videos you can create with Magisto depends on the subscription model you have, but even if you choose the most expensive version of Magisto you are still not going to be able to export videos that are longer than 10 minutes.

#### 4\. [Online UniConverter](https://www.media.io/video-editor.html)

**Price:** Free, pricing options start at $2.95 per month

Online UniConverter can be used to convert, compress or edit audio and video files for free, although your options are going to be limited if you opt for the free version of the web-based application. The free Video Editor enables you to perform basic video editing actions like trimming, cropping or rotating videos. In addition, you can adjust the Hue, Saturation or Brightness values of all WebM files you edit with Online UniConverter.

None of the videos you edit with this web-based video editor are going to be watermarked, but exporting videos in resolutions larger than 1080p isn’t an option.

#### 5\. [Aconvert](https://www.aconvert.com/video/)

**Price:** Free

Even though this is primarily a file conversion platform that enables you to change the format of images, PDF, audio or video files, you can also use Aconvert to edit your WebM videos. You can’t do much more other than cut, crop, rotate or merge video clips. In addition, you cannot upload video clips that are larger than 200MB to this platform which can make the video editing process difficult, since WebM videos can easily exceed this size limit.

Aconvert is far from being a perfect WebM video editor, but it still offers enough video editing options to enable you to create videos you can share online.

---

## Part 2: 5 Best Free Desktop WebM Video Editors

Desktop-based video editing software products are commonly much more powerful than those that can only be used online, which makes **editing WebM videos** somewhat easier. Here are some of the best desktop WebM video editors you can use for free on Mac or PC computers.

#### 1\. [VSDC](http://www.videosoftdev.com/free-video-editor)

**Compatibility:** Windows XP or later

Editing WebM videos with VSDC isn’t any different than editing any other type of video since you just have to import a video into the editor, add it to the timeline and then remove all segments you don’t want to use. VSDC’s intuitive interface makes cutting, cropping or masking videos easy, as you can access any of these options with a single click. Moreover, the Video Stabilization tool enables you to turn shaky footage into perfectly smooth shots.

VSDC features a YouTube uploader and it lets you share your WebM videos to Facebook, Instagram or Vimeo. In addition, you can use this video editing software to change the format of your video files.

#### 2\. [OpenShot](https://www.openshot.org/)

**Compatibility:** Windows, macOS, Linux

The support for a wide range of formats and a rich selection of video editing tools, make OpenShot an excellent choice for all video content creators who want to edit WebM videos. Besides the basic video editing options like resizing, cutting or trimming OpenShot is equipped with a title editor, an extensive library of visual effects and animation and keyframe options.

Each of these video editing tools can be used to make the footage saved in WebM format look more visually pleasing. Nonetheless, you are going to need at least basic video editing skills if you want to make the most of OpenShot’s video editing options.

#### 3\. [VLC](https://www.videolan.org/vlc/index.html)

**Compatibility:** Windows, macOS, Linux

Besides being one of the most popular cross-platform media players ever created, VLC is also equipped with a set of video editing tools. In addition to converting WebM video files, you can also edit this type of file with VLC. This media player grants you access to a variety of filters, effects and color adjustment options you can use to polish your WebM videos.

Moreover, VLC lets you trim or crop each video you open with it so that you can remove the parts of the WebM videos you don’t want to share with your online audience. Even so, the process of editing a video with VLC can be too complicated for PC and Mac users who are not tech-savvy.

#### 4\. [Avidemux](http://avidemux.sourceforge.net/)

**Compatibility:** Windows, macOS, Linux

Avidemux is a simple video editor that supports a broad range of video file formats, but the set of video editing tools it offers is limited. You don’t need a lot of video editing experience to start manipulating your WebM footage with Avidemux, but you should keep in mind that this cross-platform video editor doesn’t offer advanced video editing options.

Even so, you can still use it to trim, crop, rotate or resize video clips as well as apply a variety of different filters. Adjusting the Hue, Saturation or Contrast values is also on the list of options you will have at your disposal if you choose to edit your WebM videos with Avidemux.

#### 5\. [Filmora](https://tools.techidaily.com/wondershare/filmora/download/)

**Price:**  Freemium

**Compatibility:** Windows, macOS

Editing videos on the Internet has its challenges, as most online video editors offer only a limited set of video editing tools. Even so, the video editing software products we featured in this article provide you with all the video editing options you are going to need to polish your WebM videos before posting them on social media or uploading them to your website. Let’s take a look at some of the best **online WebM video editors**.

## Part 1: 5 Best Online WebM Video Editors

The complexity of the video editing tasks you want to perform is the best way to determine which online WebM video editor you should use. So, if you would like to create WebM videos in a particular style then you should choose an [online video editing app](https://tools.techidaily.com/wondershare/filmora/download/) that allows you to do much more than just trimming or resizing a video clip. Here are the five best online WebM video editors you can use for free.

#### 1\. [ClipChamp](https://clipchamp.com/en/video-editor)

**Price:** Free, pricing options start at $9.00 per month

Before you can start editing a WebM video with Clipchamp, you must first set up an account. This online video editor already has more than 7 million registered users, which speaks volumes about its capabilities. You can choose from a broad range of fully customizable video templates that are optimized for use on different social networks and save you time on performing the video editing tasks on your own.

Clipchamp features impressive stock audio and video libraries you can use to create soundtracks or as a source of complementary footage for your WebM videos. The free version of this online video editor only lets you export videos in 480p resolution and you cannot use the stock footage for free.

#### 2\. [WeVideo](https://www.wevideo.com/)

**Price:** Free, pricing options start at $4.99 per month

This video editing platform offers a broad range of video editing options, so you will have very little trouble turning your footage saved in WebM format into attention-grabbing videos. The video editing tools you will have at your disposal depending on the subscription model you purchase.

With the Free version of WeVideo, you will only have five minutes of publishing time, you won’t be able to export WebM videos in resolutions larger than 480p and each video you create is going to be watermarked. That is why you must opt for Power, Unlimited, Professional or Business subscription package if you want your WebM videos to really stand out on social media.

#### 3\. [Magisto](https://www.magisto.com/)

**Price:** Free, pricing options start at $4.99

Video content creators who post their videos on Instagram, Facebook or YouTube are going to love using Magisto. This web-based video editor is powered by AI that does all the video editing for you, which enables you to simply import the WebM videos you want to edit, select a video editing style and enjoy the results. In addition, you can choose from hundreds of customizable templates that can be used to promote a business or to create a Valentine’s Day video.

The duration of the videos you can create with Magisto depends on the subscription model you have, but even if you choose the most expensive version of Magisto you are still not going to be able to export videos that are longer than 10 minutes.

#### 4\. [Online UniConverter](https://www.media.io/video-editor.html)

**Price:** Free, pricing options start at $2.95 per month

Online UniConverter can be used to convert, compress or edit audio and video files for free, although your options are going to be limited if you opt for the free version of the web-based application. The free Video Editor enables you to perform basic video editing actions like trimming, cropping or rotating videos. In addition, you can adjust the Hue, Saturation or Brightness values of all WebM files you edit with Online UniConverter.

None of the videos you edit with this web-based video editor are going to be watermarked, but exporting videos in resolutions larger than 1080p isn’t an option.

#### 5\. [Aconvert](https://www.aconvert.com/video/)

**Price:** Free

Even though this is primarily a file conversion platform that enables you to change the format of images, PDF, audio or video files, you can also use Aconvert to edit your WebM videos. You can’t do much more other than cut, crop, rotate or merge video clips. In addition, you cannot upload video clips that are larger than 200MB to this platform which can make the video editing process difficult, since WebM videos can easily exceed this size limit.

Aconvert is far from being a perfect WebM video editor, but it still offers enough video editing options to enable you to create videos you can share online.

## Part 2: 5 Best Free Desktop WebM Video Editors

Desktop-based video editing software products are commonly much more powerful than those that can only be used online, which makes **editing WebM videos** somewhat easier. Here are some of the best desktop WebM video editors you can use for free on Mac or PC computers.

#### 1\. [VSDC](http://www.videosoftdev.com/free-video-editor)

**Compatibility:** Windows XP or later

Editing WebM videos with VSDC isn’t any different than editing any other type of video since you just have to import a video into the editor, add it to the timeline and then remove all segments you don’t want to use. VSDC’s intuitive interface makes cutting, cropping or masking videos easy, as you can access any of these options with a single click. Moreover, the Video Stabilization tool enables you to turn shaky footage into perfectly smooth shots.

VSDC features a YouTube uploader and it lets you share your WebM videos to Facebook, Instagram or Vimeo. In addition, you can use this video editing software to change the format of your video files.

#### 2\. [OpenShot](https://www.openshot.org/)

**Compatibility:** Windows, macOS, Linux

The support for a wide range of formats and a rich selection of video editing tools, make OpenShot an excellent choice for all video content creators who want to edit WebM videos. Besides the basic video editing options like resizing, cutting or trimming OpenShot is equipped with a title editor, an extensive library of visual effects and animation and keyframe options.

Each of these video editing tools can be used to make the footage saved in WebM format look more visually pleasing. Nonetheless, you are going to need at least basic video editing skills if you want to make the most of OpenShot’s video editing options.

#### 3\. [VLC](https://www.videolan.org/vlc/index.html)

**Compatibility:** Windows, macOS, Linux

Besides being one of the most popular cross-platform media players ever created, VLC is also equipped with a set of video editing tools. In addition to converting WebM video files, you can also edit this type of file with VLC. This media player grants you access to a variety of filters, effects and color adjustment options you can use to polish your WebM videos.

Moreover, VLC lets you trim or crop each video you open with it so that you can remove the parts of the WebM videos you don’t want to share with your online audience. Even so, the process of editing a video with VLC can be too complicated for PC and Mac users who are not tech-savvy.

You don’t need a lot of video editing experience to start manipulating your WebM footage with Avidemux, but you should keep in mind that this cross-platform video editor doesn’t offer advanced video editing options.

Even so, you can still use it to trim, crop, rotate or resize video clips as well as apply a variety of different filters. Adjusting the Hue, Saturation or Contrast values is also on the list of options you will have at your disposal if you choose to edit your WebM videos with Avidemux.

Here are the five best online WebM video editors you can use for free.

#### 1\. [ClipChamp](https://clipchamp.com/en/video-editor)

**Price:** Free, pricing options start at $9.00 per month

Before you can start editing a WebM video with Clipchamp, you must first set up an account. This online video editor already has more than 7 million registered users, which speaks volumes about its capabilities. You can choose from a broad range of fully customizable video templates that are optimized for use on different social networks and save you time on performing the video editing tasks on your own.

Clipchamp features impressive stock audio and video libraries you can use to create soundtracks or as a source of complementary footage for your WebM videos. The free version of this online video editor only lets you export videos in 480p resolution and you cannot use the stock footage for free.

#### 2\. [WeVideo](https://www.wevideo.com/)

**Price:** Free, pricing options start at $4.99 per month

This video editing platform offers a broad range of video editing options, so you will have very little trouble turning your footage saved in WebM format into attention-grabbing videos. The video editing tools you will have at your disposal depending on the subscription model you purchase.

With the Free version of WeVideo, you will only have five minutes of publishing time, you won’t be able to export WebM videos in resolutions larger than 480p and each video you create is going to be watermarked. That is why you must opt for Power, Unlimited, Professional or Business subscription package if you want your WebM videos to really stand out on social media.

#### 3\. [Magisto](https://www.magisto.com/)

**Price:** Free, pricing options start at $4.99

Video content creators who post their videos on Instagram, Facebook or YouTube are going to love using Magisto. This web-based video editor is powered by AI that does all the video editing for you, which enables you to simply import the WebM videos you want to edit, select a video editing style and enjoy the results. In addition, you can choose from hundreds of customizable templates that can be used to promote a business or to create a Valentine’s Day video.

The duration of the videos you can create with Magisto depends on the subscription model you have, but even if you choose the most expensive version of Magisto you are still not going to be able to export videos that are longer than 10 minutes.

#### 4\. [Online UniConverter](https://www.media.io/video-editor.html)

**Price:** Free, pricing options start at $2.95 per month

Online UniConverter can be used to convert, compress or edit audio and video files for free, although your options are going to be limited if you opt for the free version of the web-based application. The free Video Editor enables you to perform basic video editing actions like trimming, cropping or rotating videos. In addition, you can adjust the Hue, Saturation or Brightness values of all WebM files you edit with Online UniConverter.

None of the videos you edit with this web-based video editor are going to be watermarked, but exporting videos in resolutions larger than 1080p isn’t an option.

#### 5\. [Aconvert](https://www.aconvert.com/video/)

**Price:** Free

Even though this is primarily a file conversion platform that enables you to change the format of images, PDF, audio or video files, you can also use Aconvert to edit your WebM videos. You can’t do much more other than cut, crop, rotate or merge video clips. In addition, you cannot upload video clips that are larger than 200MB to this platform which can make the video editing process difficult, since WebM videos can easily exceed this size limit.

Aconvert is far from being a perfect WebM video editor, but it still offers enough video editing options to enable you to create videos you can share online.

## Part 2: 5 Best Free Desktop WebM Video Editors

Desktop-based video editing software products are commonly much more powerful than those that can only be used online, which makes **editing WebM videos** somewhat easier. Here are some of the best desktop WebM video editors you can use for free on Mac or PC computers.

#### 1\. [VSDC](http://www.videosoftdev.com/free-video-editor)

Moreover, the Video Stabilization tool enables you to turn shaky footage into perfectly smooth shots.

VSDC features a YouTube uploader and it lets you share your WebM videos to Facebook, Instagram or Vimeo. In addition, you can use this video editing software to change the format of your video files.

Each of these video editing tools can be used to make the footage saved in WebM format look more visually pleasing. Nonetheless, you are going to need at least basic video editing skills if you want to make the most of OpenShot’s video editing options.

#### 3\. [VLC](https://www.videolan.org/vlc/index.html)

Moreover, VLC lets you trim or crop each video you open with it so that you can remove the parts of the WebM videos you don’t want to share with your online audience. Even so, the process of editing a video with VLC can be too complicated for PC and Mac users who are not tech-savvy.

## Part 1: Stabilize Video with Built-in Warp Stabilizer in AE

The Warp Stabilizer effect is a new technique to cope with unsteady video. In this part, I will show you how to apply Warp Stabilizer to a layer, adjust the effect's essential parameters, and demonstrate how they work briefly.

**Step 1:** The Warp Stabilizer is the most excellent built-in choice for After Effects. This may be found under the Distort tools section of the Effects & Presets panel. You may also go to the effects tab and look for "**Warp**" in the search box.

![after effects effects presets pane](https://images.wondershare.com/filmora/article-images/after-effects-effects-presets-pane.jpg)

**Step 2:** When you've identified **Warp Stabilizer**, you'll have to add it to the layer you want to stabilize. You may accomplish this in one of three different ways. You may either drag and drop the filter into the chosen layer in the composing window, place it on the desired layer in the timeline, or double-tap on the effect while selecting your choice footage layer.

![after effects warp stabilizer vfx](https://images.wondershare.com/filmora/article-images/after-effects-warp-stabilizer-vfx.jpg)

**Step 3:** Once you apply the warp stabilizer, it will start immediately. So now, all you have to do is lay back and let the stabilizer do its job.

(Note: The procedure should take no more than a few minutes, and a blue bar will appear across your composition window, indicating that the warp stabilizer is evaluating the film. The composition panel would then display an orange bar, indicating that the effect is applied).

**Step 4:** After stabilization, use the spacebar to begin a RAM peek. Choose the layer you added to and click to display the drop-down menu or go to the Effects Control panel whenever you need to tweak the stabilizing effect.

## Part 2: Stabilize Shaky Video with Track Motion Feature in AE

Using Stabilize Motion feature to stabilize video is an old-school heritage function from the era of the Creative Suite, it will still be there in After Effects presently and performs admirably.

**Step 1:** The tracker panel is most likely open by default in your edition of After Effects, but if it isn't, go to **Window** in the top menu to open it. Once you've arrived here, scroll to the bottom until you locate **Tracker** and double-check that it has a checkbox beside it.

![after effects tracker pane](https://images.wondershare.com/filmora/article-images/after-effects-tracker-pane.jpg)

**Step 2:** Select Stabilize Motion from the drop-down menu whenever the tracker panel is open. You'll see that a tracker box appears in your **Layer Panel** once you've done this.

(**Note**: You'll need to identify a proper location in your film for the tracker to operate at this stage. We're monitoring a vehicle using a camera operator's drone in the instance below).

![after effects tracker track motion](https://images.wondershare.com/filmora/article-images/after-effects-tracker-track-motion.jpg)

**Step 3**: Let's press the **Play** button on the tracker panel once we've set up the tracker box. The tracker box should adhere to the location or item you chose when you do this.

(**Note**: When your tracking points start to go astray, use the **Pause** button, personally modify the tracking point, and then push play to resume the journey).

![adobe effects track motion effects](https://images.wondershare.com/filmora/article-images/adobe-effects-track-motion-effects.jpg)

**Step 4:** When the tracker is done and satisfied with the results, click **Edit target** to verify that the tracking data is transferred to the correct layer. Then proceed to the bottom of the page and click the **Apply** option.

(**Note** A dialogue window with choices for applying them. Usually, you'll want to choose **X and Y** here).

![edit target track motion feature](https://images.wondershare.com/filmora/article-images/edit-target-track-motion-feature.jpg)

Hit the spacebar to evaluate how well the stabilize motion tracker performed now when you're back in the composition window. When you're not pleased with the outcomes, you might have to go back to try again. Although this approach is best used for photos with a clear point of focus that doesn't go out of frame, it could still be helpful in some situations.

## Part 3: Using Stabilization Plugins for Smoother Video in AE

As a graphic and motion designer, animator, or 3D artist, [After Effects plugins](https://tools.techidaily.com/wondershare/filmora/download/) may completely change the way you operate. Since it can handle so much right out of the box, Adobe After Effects CC is already a go-to motion graphic and compositing program for many artists.

However, as with any good program, third-party plugins could only help you take your work to the next level by adding new features or streamlining your process.

It should be unsurprising that After Effects has many plugins for a program that is over 30 years old. Here are the best stabilization plugins for smoother video in AE:

### 1\. [Orb](https://www.videocopilot.net/orb/)

Orb is focused on generating realistic planets and includes a range of unique features to make planetary creation easy. It utilizes a similar 3D engine to Video Copilot's great Element 3D plugin, and it employs a similar 3D engine to Video Copilot's outstanding Element 3D plugin.

You would believe that making planets in 3D is simple —create a circle, add textures, and you're done! Getting a world to 'look' properly, on the other hand, might be more complicated than it appears.

For example, how can the line between night and day be altered in a model of a populated planet such that cities may be visible at night but not during the day?

Although Orb doesn't work for every planetary picture, this would function for 90% of them and is a helpful previs tool. This is particularly true when used in conjunction with other After Effects plugins or paired with a 3D lens from a 3D program, which may be brought into After Effects with background plates for things like spacecraft.

### 2\. [**Depth of Field Generator PRO (DOF PRO)**](http://richardrosenman.com/shop/dof-pro-ae/)

Richard Rosenman's renowned Photoshop depth of field generator plugin, DOF PRO (Depth of Field Generator PRO), is now downloadable for After Effects. DOF PRO has become the industry's professional option for an unprecedented and complex depth of field effects rapidly and effectively as a post-process.

This is thanks to almost a decade of discovery and application since the first launch in 2005\. DOF PRO's cutting-edge characteristics offer new and advanced technologies not found anywhere else, resulting in one of the industry's most potent and sophisticated depth of field processors.

Capability for chromatic and achromatic aberration, focal plane bokeh distinction, astigmatism and vignetting effects, bespoke aperture maps, and noise recovery are among the advanced features.

There will also be compatibility with the alpha channel and transparency, 32-bit floating-point color, correct aperture displays, and an iris array display. A feature comparison between the plugin and After Effects' Camera Lens Blur effect can be found here.

### 3\. [ReelSteady](https://www.reelsteady.com/)

ReelSteady for After Effects is a recent addition to the stabilization marketplace. ReelSteady is similar to After Effects' warp stabilizer plugin. However, the stabilization in ReelSteady is far superior.

ReelSteady also has several other features that make it ideal for creating next-level tunes. Users may design filters to block off specific sections of your frame. This is useful for removing a subject that travels around the frame a lot.

In terms of performance, the After Effects plugin is pretty similar to the warp stabilizer but with a few more features. To begin with, ReelSteady includes a built-in rolling shutter repair tool that operates in tandem with its built-in stabilizer.

The ReelSteady effect is a two-pass effect. For instance, after the effect has been executed for the first time, you will likely wish to level out certain places. You'll successfully isolate specific parts in the effect to "iron out" sections of the footage.

You would like to record your film at a more excellent resolution than your expected outcome to get the most out of ReelSteady. If you wish to output your video in 4K, you might capture it in 4.6K or 5K. You'll have some leeway for ReelSteady to work its magic.

ReelSteady's sole flaw is its high price ($399). ReelSteady is not available in After Effects, unlike some of the other choices on this list. ReelSteady, on the other hand, is the way to go if you would like the smoothest footage imaginable.

**Conclusion**

Shaky video footage would be the last thing any video creator wants unless it's done intentionally for artistic or creative reasons. As a result, they employ methods and equipment to keep the camera safe from any undesired movement.

However, occasionally those tools aren't available, and the outcome is questionable. That is why we decided to compile this article to add to the knowledge of our readers how they can use **After Effects to** **stabilize videos** to enhance their video content!

Video content is becoming increasingly popular; with the proliferation of online content, practically every product now needs its mini-documentary or video clip. Experienced filmmakers and VFX artists used to be the only ones who could get smooth footage. Those days, however, are over.

Adobe After Effects is an excellent tool for smoothing out video footage, in addition to being a great blending and motion animation software; although it's usually preferable to maintain your film as seamless as possible on location, it's not the end of the world if you take a seat to edit your video and decide it's too shaky. In truth, there are several options available to you. In After Effects, there are three options for stabilizing footage. What are they – and how to use **After Effects to** **stabilize footage**? Let's find out!

![after effects tracker track motion](https://images.wondershare.com/filmora/article-images/after-effects-tracker-track-motion.jpg)

**Step 3**: Let's press the **Play** button on the tracker panel once we've set up the tracker box. The tracker box should adhere to the location or item you chose when you do this.

(**Note**: When your tracking points start to go astray, use the **Pause** button, personally modify the tracking point, and then push play to resume the journey).

![adobe effects track motion effects](https://images.wondershare.com/filmora/article-images/adobe-effects-track-motion-effects.jpg)

**Step 4:** When the tracker is done and satisfied with the results, click **Edit target** to verify that the tracking data is transferred to the correct layer. Then proceed to the bottom of the page and click the **Apply** option.

(**Note** A dialogue window with choices for applying them. Usually, you'll want to choose **X and Y** here).

Hit the spacebar to evaluate how well the stabilize motion tracker performed now when you're back in the composition window. When you're not pleased with the outcomes, you might have to go back to try again. Although this approach is best used for photos with a clear point of focus that doesn't go out of frame, it could still be helpful in some situations.

## Part 3: Using Stabilization Plugins for Smoother Video in AE

As a graphic and motion designer, animator, or 3D artist, [After Effects plugins](https://tools.techidaily.com/wondershare/filmora/download/) may completely change the way you operate. Since it can handle so much right out of the box, Adobe After Effects CC is already a go-to motion graphic and compositing program for many artists.

However, as with any good program, third-party plugins could only help you take your work to the next level by adding new features or streamlining your process.

It should be unsurprising that After Effects has many plugins for a program that is over 30 years old. Here are the best stabilization plugins for smoother video in AE:

### 1\. [Orb](https://www.videocopilot.net/orb/)

Orb is focused on generating realistic planets and includes a range of unique features to make planetary creation easy. It utilizes a similar 3D engine to Video Copilot's great Element 3D plugin, and it employs a similar 3D engine to Video Copilot's outstanding Element 3D plugin.

You would believe that making planets in 3D is simple —create a circle, add textures, and you're done! Getting a world to 'look' properly, on the other hand, might be more complicated than it appears.

For example, how can the line between night and day be altered in a model of a populated planet such that cities may be visible at night but not during the day?

Although Orb doesn't work for every planetary picture, this would function for 90% of them and is a helpful previs tool. This is particularly true when used in conjunction with other After Effects plugins or paired with a 3D lens from a 3D program, which may be brought into After Effects with background plates for things like spacecraft.

### 2\. [**Depth of Field Generator PRO (DOF PRO)**](http://richardrosenman.com/shop/dof-pro-ae/)

Richard Rosenman's renowned Photoshop depth of field generator plugin, DOF PRO (Depth of Field Generator PRO), is now downloadable for After Effects. DOF PRO has become the industry's professional option for an unprecedented and complex depth of field effects rapidly and effectively as a post-process.

This is thanks to almost a decade of discovery and application since the first launch in 2005\. DOF PRO's cutting-edge characteristics offer new and advanced technologies not found anywhere else, resulting in one of the industry's most potent and sophisticated depth of field processors.

Capability for chromatic and achromatic aberration, focal plane bokeh distinction, astigmatism and vignetting effects, bespoke aperture maps, and noise recovery are among the advanced features.

There will also be compatibility with the alpha channel and transparency, 32-bit floating-point color, correct aperture displays, and an iris array display. A feature comparison between the plugin and After Effects' Camera Lens Blur effect can be found here.

### 3\. [ReelSteady](https://www.reelsteady.com/)

ReelSteady for After Effects is a recent addition to the stabilization marketplace. ReelSteady is similar to After Effects' warp stabilizer plugin. However, the stabilization in ReelSteady is far superior.

ReelSteady also has several other features that make it ideal for creating next-level tunes. Users may design filters to block off specific sections of your frame. This is useful for removing a subject that travels around the frame a lot.

In terms of performance, the After Effects plugin is pretty similar to the warp stabilizer but with a few more features. To begin with, ReelSteady includes a built-in rolling shutter repair tool that operates in tandem with its built-in stabilizer.

The ReelSteady effect is a two-pass effect. For instance, after the effect has been executed for the first time, you will likely wish to level out certain places. You'll successfully isolate specific parts in the effect to "iron out" sections of the footage.

You would like to record your film at a more excellent resolution than your expected outcome to get the most out of ReelSteady. If you wish to output your video in 4K, you might capture it in 4.6K or 5K. You'll have some leeway for ReelSteady to work its magic.

ReelSteady's sole flaw is its high price ($399). ReelSteady is not available in After Effects, unlike some of the other choices on this list. ReelSteady, on the other hand, is the way to go if you would like the smoothest footage imaginable.

**Conclusion**

Shaky video footage would be the last thing any video creator wants unless it's done intentionally for artistic or creative reasons. As a result, they employ methods and equipment to keep the camera safe from any undesired movement.

However, occasionally those tools aren't available, and the outcome is questionable. That is why we decided to compile this article to add to the knowledge of our readers how they can use **After Effects to** **stabilize videos** to enhance their video content!
