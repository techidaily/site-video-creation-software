Nowadays, people are more addicted to making reels, short videos, YouTube shorts, etc. This is where the **WAV converter** comes in.

It is the most versatile audio format that is compatible with almost all devices. WAV audio format is very useful for digital content creators. So, without any further ado, let’s dive into detailed facts and benefits of WAV audio format:

![wav](https://images.wondershare.com/filmora/article-images/2022/01/the-only-guide-you'll-ever-need-to-learn-about-wav-converter-1.jpg)

#### In this article

01 [Basic Knowledge About the WAV Format](#Part 1)

02 [The Best 6 Fast and Easy WAV Converter Online Free ](#Part 2)

03 [5 Quick Ways to Convert MP4 to WAV Audio Files Online and Offline](#Part 3)

04 [5 Best YouTube to WAV Converter](#Part 4)

## Part 1 Basic Knowledge About the WAV Format

### 01What is a WAV file?

WAV is an audio format that is developed by IBM & Microsoft. This audio file format is specially created to be used for uncompressed audio files on Microsoft Windows systems. It is used for storing audio bitstreams on PCs, which are encoded in the Linear Pulse-Code Modulation (LPCM) format.

### 02What's the WAV audio format?

WAV audio file format is also known as Waveform audio file format. It is a subset of Microsoft’s RIFF specification. This audio format starts with a file header, which is followed by data chunks. There are three main types of chunks in a WAV file, which are given as follows:

**●** 'fmt” chunk – This chunk is used to specify the data format.

**●** 'data” chunk – This chunk contains the actual sample of data.

**●** 'RIFF” chunk – This chunk is mainly used to identify a WAV file.

### 03Advantages of Using WAV

There are the following advantages of using a WAV audio file format:

**●** WAV audio file gives the best sound quality, which resembles the sound coming from the original source of the sound.

**●** WAV files are primarily used for storing the recordings.

**●** WAV files can efficiently be converted into other different audio formats like MP3, and AIFF.

**●** This audio file format also allows the developers to move audio files between different computer platforms easily and freely.

**●** WAV file provides the benefit of easy editing to developers, podcasters, and other digital content creators.

### 04Is WAV Format Better than MP3?

Yes, WAV format is way better than MP3\. It provides a better audio quality as compared to the MP3 file. Although MP3 files are smaller in size, they lack a good sound quality. Another major difference between a WAV file and an MP3 file is that the MP3 file enables easy editing and storage of compressed files, while on the other hand, the WAV file enables easy editing and storage of uncompressed audio files. Uncompressed files can always be easily converted into compressed files, which also helps in retaining the sound quality.
