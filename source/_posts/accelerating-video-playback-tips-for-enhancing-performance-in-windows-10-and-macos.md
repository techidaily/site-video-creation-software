Under this circumstance, you need a video player with fast forward function to help fast skip the boring part or just skim through the whole video quickly in a short time. 5KPlayer is such a [video player with speed control](https://tools.techidaily.com/5kplayer/video-music-player/) for anyone who wants to speed up or slow down a video. With multiple speed choices support, it’s up to you to manually choose which mode to play videos faster in image, sound and subtitle. Also, it plays the fast motion videos accelerated by a video editor, downloaded from Dailymotion or recorded by a tool using fast motion mode very smoothly. Just choose the speed you prefer and instantly change the video speed with 5KPlayer.

**Speed choices during video playback:** x2.0 (speed up), x1.5 (speed up), x1.2 (speed up), x1.0 (original), x0.8 (slow down), x0.7 (slow down), x0.5 (slow down).

**Step 1.** Free download 5KPlayer for Windows or Mac, install and launch it.  
**Step 2.** Choose a video to play with 5KPlayer, be it 4K UHD 1080p 720p or MP4 AV1 MKV etc. video.  
**Step 3.** When the video is playing, right-click on the video to choose "Speed" to increase your video speed.  
**Step 4.** Choose x2.0, x1.5, or x1.2 option to speed up your video.

Notice, x2.0, x1.5 and x1.2 options allow you to accelerate your video speed, x1.0 option keeps your video original speed, and x0.8, x0.7 and x0.5 will help slow down your video during playback.

**Notice!** There is the speed control option for you to choose when you **play videos on online video sites** like YouTube and Dailymotion. However, there are also exceptions like big name Facebook and Vimeo which have no such functions as the HTML 5 video players they adopt have hidden the video speed control functionality of HTML 5 videos. To play online videos in faster mode, you are suggested to install an extension like Video Speed Control Chrome extension to offer some helps.

Speed up video to make even the serious video funny and interesting? Accelerate video speed for further editing? Or increase video speed to reduce time so as to upload the whole video to TikTok or YouTube that has limitations to the length of a video? 5KPlayer, an offline method to help make your video a fast motion video.

**Step 1.** Free download 5KPlayer if you didn’t, then install and launch it on your computer.  
**Step 2.** Play a video with 5KPlayer that you want to make it a fast motion video, then click on the "scissors" ![](https://www.5kplayer.com/video-music-player/../user-guide/img/scissors-icon.jpg) icon to access 5KPlayer "Video Editing" window.  
**Step 3.** In the right part, choose the speed you prefer by inputting a number or using the slider. You are allowed to choose a speed from x0.25 to x2.0\. To speed up a video, you should choose a number larger than x1.0\.   
**Step 4.** Click on "Start Preview" to preview the video and make sure it is the needed speed. You can also adjust the playback speed during the preview.  
**Step 5.** After the above steps, click on "Save file" to output the video that had been speeded up.

My video example is 2:52s long, and it becomes 1:26s long after being accelerated. Though 5KPlayer has nearly halved the length of the video time, the video quality doesn’t get worse at least the naked eyes can’t distinguish. Because it is an offline method, it won’t collect any information of your personal data.

**Notice!**  
**Online video speed changer** is a good option to speed up your video, but you need to know something.  
 • Though most of them have a wide support for video formats including MP4, WebM, AVI, MPEG, FLV, MOV, 3GP, the max file size of a video to adjust speed is often small.  
 • You need to upload your video first > change the video speed online and then download the accelerated video.  
 • The network speed influences the whole process, the process will get crashed when the network is weak. Also, crashing problem happens when the file is large in size and high in resolution.

• Can’t assure the security because you can’t assure if the server has kept your data though server owner has acclaimed that he/she has deleted the uploaded video. Not sure if others can access your files.
