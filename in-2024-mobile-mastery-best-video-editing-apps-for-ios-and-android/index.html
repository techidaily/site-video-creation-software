<h3 id="1-Windows-10-Photos-App"><a href="#1-Windows-10-Photos-App" class="headerlink" title="1  Windows 10 Photos App"></a>1  Windows 10 Photos App</h3><p><strong>Supported System</strong>: Windows 10 and Windows 11</p>
<p><strong>Pricing:</strong> Free</p>
<p>Microsoft or Windows Photo App, a free photo viewer and editor bundled with Windows 10, provides capable image editing and photo improvements, as well as capabilities for managing and editing video, all in a touch-friendly interface.</p>
<p>You may doodle on photographs, add background music and 3D effects to films, and use automated object tagging to make searching easier. Microsoft Photos is a wonderful tool for working with digital photographs, and for certain users, it may even replace third-party photo applications.</p>
<p>The Windows 10 Photos application’s artificial intelligence function allows you to create a video with music automatically with the <a target="_blank" rel="noopener" href="https://tools.techidaily.com/wondershare/filmora/download/"><strong>Automatic Video feature</strong></a>. It’s simple to accomplish, what’s more, there are some music track presets in the Photos app, so you can change the background music and edit it further manually.</p>
<p>Besides that, you can also create a new video project from scratch and choose music from its background music library.</p>
<p><strong>Step 1:</strong> Launch the Photos app, go to <strong>New video</strong> and then click <strong>New Video Project</strong> button at the top of the screen, and then rename the video accordingly.</p>

                      alt="windows 10 photos new video project"
                ></p>
<p><strong>Step 2:</strong> Click on the <strong>+Add</strong> option to import photos or videos to the project from your PC or collection, and then drop and place them to the storyboard.</p>
<p><img  
                     lazyload
                     src="/images/loading.svg"

                      alt="place video image to windows 10 photos storyboard"
                ></p>
<p><strong>Step 3:</strong> Next, from the top-right, press the <strong>Background music</strong> menu, pick one from the list. And the music track will fit to the length of the video automatically. You can enable <a target="_blank" rel="noopener" href="https://tools.techidaily.com/wondershare/filmora/download/"><strong>Sync your video to the music’s beat</strong></a> to sync music to the beat of a video.</p>

<p><strong>Step 4:</strong> Then press the <strong>Done</strong> button. This is how you can use the Windows Photos App and add a soundtrack from its background music library to videos. Windows 10 has several benefits, and with the correct tools, you can get the most out of it.</p>

However, <a class="link"   target="_blank" rel="noopener" href="https://tools.techidaily.com/wondershare/filmora/download/" >Apple’s video editing software <i class="fa-regular fa-arrow-up-right-from-square fa-sm"></i></a> hasn’t evolved much in the last several years.</p>
<p>Nevertheless, it still outperforms what you will get with Windows 10, which would be limited to the (albeit increasing) video capabilities integrated within Windows’ Photos app.</p>
<p>In your digital films, Apple iMovie contains superb capabilities for media management, color grading, speed, green-screen effects, narration, and music.</p>
<p>It isn’t always the first to support new formats—<a class="link"   target="_blank" rel="noopener" href="https://tools.techidaily.com/wondershare/filmora/download/" >360-degree video <i class="fa-regular fa-arrow-up-right-from-square fa-sm"></i></a> is currently unavailable, but it supports 4K. <a class="link"   target="_blank" rel="noopener" href="https://tools.techidaily.com/wondershare/filmora/download/" >Trailers <i class="fa-regular fa-arrow-up-right-from-square fa-sm"></i></a> and Movies are two of the greatest storyboard-based movie-making features for beginners in iMovie.</p>
<p>For beginner-level video editing, Apple iMovie is an excellent choice. For background sound, the iMovie creator integrates with iTunes and GarageBand, and you may choose from a good range of background soundtracks and audio effects, such as four pitch levels, cosmic, and robot.</p>
<p>The Reduce Background Noise option, on the other hand, is controlled by a slider. Follow these steps to add music to your videos using iMovie:</p>
<p><strong>Step 1:</strong> Click the <strong>Add Media</strong> button while your application is visible in the timeline.</p>
<p><strong>Step 2:</strong> To access the built-in music, go to <strong>Audio</strong>, then <strong>Soundtracks</strong>.</p>
<p><strong>Step 3:</strong> To hear a sample of a soundtrack, press it. If a soundtrack is muted, press it to download it first, then tap it again to listen to it.</p>
<p><strong>Step 4:</strong> Tap the <strong>Add Audio</strong> button near a soundtrack to include it in your composition. iMovie sets the music at the start of the project and instantly adjusts it to the project’s duration.</p>

<p>Apple’s entry-level desktop video editing software can transform your video and photographs into professional-looking creations. However, <a class="link"   target="_blank" rel="noopener" href="https://tools.techidaily.com/wondershare/filmora/download/" >Apple’s video editing software <i class="fa-regular fa-arrow-up-right-from-square fa-sm"></i></a> hasn’t evolved much in the last several years.</p>
<p>Nevertheless, it still outperforms what you will get with Windows 10, which would be limited to the (albeit increasing) video capabilities integrated within Windows’ Photos app.</p>
<p>In your digital films, Apple iMovie contains superb capabilities for media management, color grading, speed, green-screen effects, narration, and music.</p>
<p>It isn’t always the first to support new formats—<a class="link"   target="_blank" rel="noopener" href="https://tools.techidaily.com/wondershare/filmora/download/" >360-degree video <i class="fa-regular fa-arrow-up-right-from-square fa-sm"></i></a> is currently unavailable, but it supports 4K. <a class="link"   target="_blank" rel="noopener" href="https://tools.techidaily.com/wondershare/filmora/download/" >Trailers <i class="fa-regular fa-arrow-up-right-from-square fa-sm"></i></a> and Movies are two of the greatest storyboard-based movie-making features for beginners in iMovie.</p>
<p>For beginner-level video editing, Apple iMovie is an excellent choice. For background sound, the iMovie creator integrates with iTunes and GarageBand, and you may choose from a good range of background soundtracks and audio effects, such as four pitch levels, cosmic, and robot.</p>
<p>The Reduce Background Noise option, on the other hand, is controlled by a slider. Follow these steps to add music to your videos using iMovie:</p>
<p><strong>Step 1:</strong> Click the <strong>Add Media</strong> button while your application is visible in the timeline.</p>
<p><strong>Step 2:</strong> To access the built-in music, go to <strong>Audio</strong>, then <strong>Soundtracks</strong>.</p>
<p><strong>Step 3:</strong> To hear a sample of a soundtrack, press it. If a soundtrack is muted, press it to download it first, then tap it again to listen to it.</p>
<p><strong>Step 4:</strong> Tap the <strong>Add Audio</strong> button near a soundtrack to include it in your composition. iMovie sets the music at the start of the project and instantly adjusts it to the project’s duration.</p>

<h2 id="Part-1-Key-Facebook-Cover-Video-Specifications"><a href="#Part-1-Key-Facebook-Cover-Video-Specifications" class="headerlink" title="Part 1 Key Facebook Cover Video Specifications"></a>Part 1 Key Facebook Cover Video Specifications</h2><p>A Facebook cover video works like a mini-advertisement that is played on a loop continuously. To keep the visitors engaged and interested in the video, the video needs to look neat, clean, bright and in the right size and the aspect ratio to fit perfectly in the given space. Key specifications for the cover video are enlisted below.</p>
<p><strong>Video cover Facebook size</strong>: As such, there are no specific size guidelines issues but it is recommended to keep the size of the video less than 1.75GB. The small size will ensure that users having slower browsing speed can also watch the video in a hassle-free manner.</p>
<p>Dimensions of the video: A video to be used as a cover should be at least 820 X 312 pixels and to get the optimum results it is suggested to keep it around 820 X 462 pixels. If you will watch the video on a desktop, it will be cropped from the sides, or the top or bottom. Thus, to ensure that the video looks perfect on a phone as well as desktop keep the aspect ratio at 16:9 and place the important text or other content at the center.</p>
<p>File type of the video: Videos in MP4 or MOV format are suggested to be used as the cover video and their resolution should be a maximum of 1080p.</p>
<p>Duration of the video: A Facebook cover video can be between 20 seconds to 90 seconds and you can also choose to play it on a loop.</p>

<p><strong>●</strong> Optimizing the video for the mobile phone users: Several times your video may run smoothly on your system but may have issues while playing on a mobile phone. So, keep your texts and important content within the specified size so that even if the video is cropped it does not look awkward.</p>
<p><strong>●</strong> Go for prompt action: It is always better to get the CTA opportunities whenever available. When something specific is required from a video like increasing traffic, adding more clients, and similar others, let the video prompt to do that and avoid adding too much text.</p>
<p><strong>●</strong> Audio is not very critical: Though audio can be added to the cover video, it does not have much relevance to the content you wish to showcase to the viewer. By default, the videos on Facebook are muted and also around 85% of the videos are watched without the sound.</p>
<p><strong>●</strong> Keep the focus on one visual: A Facebook page is already too crowded and thus avoids loading the cover video with too much content. Focus on a single visual which can be text, image, CTA, or other depending on your purpose.</p>
<p><strong>●</strong> Keep a natural loop: The video will be played on a loop continuously and thus to make it look appealing the starting and the ending should be smooth.</p>
<p><strong>●</strong> Keeping the right size: Keeping the recommended <strong>Facebook cover page video size</strong> is important to make the video appear without any distortion, borders, or cropping.</p>

<p><strong>●</strong> Keep a natural loop: The video will be played on a loop continuously and thus to make it look appealing the starting and the ending should be smooth.</p>
<p><strong>●</strong> Keeping the right size: Keeping the recommended <strong>Facebook cover page video size</strong> is important to make the video appear without any distortion, borders, or cropping.</p>
