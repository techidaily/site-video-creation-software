## Getting Started

First, the best thing you can do to improve the quality of your keys is to improve how you shoot them. Here are seven basic production rules:

* Actors should be at least 10 feet in front of the green screen. This avoids light from the background "spilling" around their body or shoulders.
* In general, don't cast shadows on the green screen. Be very careful shooting feet.
* The green background should be as smooth as possible. Paint is always better than fabric; avoid wrinkles and folds.
* The green background should be lit smoothly, both from side to side and top to bottom. I try to have the green background display between 40-50% level on the waveform monitor.
* There is NO relationship between how the background is lit and how your actors are lit. This article will illustrate that.
* Light your background for smoothness. Light your actors for drama.
* Don't worry about having the green background fill the frame. It only needs to completely surround the edges of your actors. Garbage mattes are used to get rid of junk around the edges.

## Setting up the Key

![fx chroma 01](https://images.wondershare.com/multimedia/fx-chroma-01.jpg)

The green screen image is always placed above the background. You can place either the green screen or background image into the Primary Storyline. I find it easier to put the background in the Primary Storyline, because it makes editing the green screen image easier. But this is purely personal choice.

**Step 1: Select the green screen clip**

From the **Effects Browser > Keying** category, double-click the **Keyer** effect, which applies it to the selected clip. (You can also drag the effect on top of the clip, if you forgot to select the green-screen clip first.)

![fx chroma 02](https://images.wondershare.com/multimedia/fx-chroma-02.jpg)

Don't panic if your image looks weird – we will fix it.

![fx chroma 03](https://images.wondershare.com/multimedia/fx-chroma-03.jpg)

Click the **Sample Color** icon. This allows fine-tuning the selection of the background color.

![fx chroma 04](https://images.wondershare.com/multimedia/fx-chroma-04.jpg)

In the green-screen image, drag to select a representative section of the background. I try to get close to the face, but not so close that I accidentally select loose hair or skin.

Your key should look better immediately. Most of the time, you can probably stop here. But there are three other adjustments that can make your key look even better:

* Cleaning up the matte
* Edge adjustments
* Light wrap

![fx chroma 06](https://images.wondershare.com/multimedia/fx-chroma-06.jpg)

Click the **Matte** button to display your key as a white foreground on a black background.

![fx chroma 07](https://images.wondershare.com/multimedia/fx-chroma-07.jpg)

Your goal is the make the foreground solid white, which means opaque, and the background solid black, which means transparent. Adjust the **Fill Holes** and **Edge Distance** sliders until your key looks solid. (For REALLY bad keys, you'll need to also adjust Color Selection, mentioned below.)

![fx chroma 05](https://images.wondershare.com/multimedia/fx-chroma-05.jpg)

If an edge is too pronounced, or needs help, click the **Edges** icon.

![fx chroma 09](https://images.wondershare.com/multimedia/fx-chroma-09.jpg)

**Step 2: Tweaks Video**

Then, click and drag a line from the foreground to the background in the Canvas. Drag the midpoint slider (where my cursor is) until the edge looks the best it can. Different video formats make this easy (ProRes), while others (HDV, avchd) make this much harder. Perfection is impossible – do the best you can.

![fx chroma 09a](https://images.wondershare.com/multimedia/fx-chroma-09a.jpg)

Final Cut provides four additional tweaks at the bottom of the keyer filter:

* Color Selection
* Matte Tools
* Spill Suppression
* Light Wrap

The first three are designed to clean up poorly shot keys – read the FCP X Help files to learn how these work. (I used the Color Selection tools to clean up the very dark key I use an example later in this article.)

Light wrap, though, is aesthetic. What it does is blend colors from the background into the edges of the foreground, to make the entire key look more "organic," as if the foreground and background were actually in the same space.

This is a subtle effect, but very cool.

![fx chroma 10](https://images.wondershare.com/multimedia/fx-chroma-10.jpg)

Twirl down Light Wrap and adjust the Amount slider and watch what happens. Drag the other sliders around and see what happens. The nice thing about this setting is that when it looks good to you, it is good. The amount of the effect is totally up to you. Remember, Light Wrap only affects the edges of the foreground and should be used subtly.

![fx chroma 11](https://images.wondershare.com/multimedia/fx-chroma-11.jpg)

When you are done, you have a great looking key!

## Clean up the Image with a Garbage Mask

![fx chroma 12](https://images.wondershare.com/multimedia/fx-chroma-12.jpg)

Sometimes, however, you don't have, ah, perhaps, the best green-screen image to work with. Here, for example, there are lighting instruments in the foreground, with a very inadequately lit green screen in the background. (Sigh… this is just pitiful.)

Once you pull the key – which is film-speak for creating a green-screen shot, as I described above – and get it looking as good as possible, there's one more step: adding a garbage matte to get rid of all the garbage surrounding your actors.

![fx chroma 13](https://images.wondershare.com/multimedia/fx-chroma-13.jpg)

Once you get your key looking as good as you can – which in this case isn't all that good – drag the Mask effect (**Effects > Keying > Mask**) on top of the green-screen clip.

**NOTE**: The Mask effect should always be added after the Keying effect, so that the Mask is below the Keyer in the Inspector.

![fx chroma 14](https://images.wondershare.com/multimedia/fx-chroma-14.jpg)

Then, drag each of the four circles to create a shape such that your foreground image is contained inside it, and everything you want to exclude is outside. Here, for instance, we removed the light stand, the edge of the green background and the tearing at the top of the image. I've found this Mask effect works best when applied to a connected clip.

However, the big limitation of the Mask effect is that you only have four points to work with. That's where a free effect comes in, which allows you to create far more flexible shapes with it. It's written by Alex Gollner and is available on his website – alex4d.wordpress.com/fcpx/ – I recommend his effects highly.

## How to Create a Chroma-Key in easier ways?

Chroma-key, or green screen, is an essential part of every editor to make all kinds of effects. Is there any way to make this sophisticated procedure easier way? Yes, try Filmora.

In version 10.5 for Mac, Filmora added a new feature: AI portrait. It allows you to do a green screen effect with just one click.

![fx chroma 06](https://images.wondershare.com/multimedia/fx-chroma-06.jpg)

Click the **Matte** button to display your key as a white foreground on a black background.

![fx chroma 07](https://images.wondershare.com/multimedia/fx-chroma-07.jpg)

Your goal is the make the foreground solid white, which means opaque, and the background solid black, which means transparent. Adjust the **Fill Holes** and **Edge Distance** sliders until your key looks solid. (For REALLY bad keys, you'll need to also adjust Color Selection, mentioned below.)

![fx chroma 05](https://images.wondershare.com/multimedia/fx-chroma-05.jpg)

If an edge is too pronounced, or needs help, click the **Edges** icon.

![fx chroma 09](https://images.wondershare.com/multimedia/fx-chroma-09.jpg)

**Step 2: Tweaks Video**

Then, click and drag a line from the foreground to the background in the Canvas. Drag the midpoint slider (where my cursor is) until the edge looks the best it can. Different video formats make this easy (ProRes), while others (HDV, avchd) make this much harder. Perfection is impossible – do the best you can.

![fx chroma 09a](https://images.wondershare.com/multimedia/fx-chroma-09a.jpg)

Final Cut provides four additional tweaks at the bottom of the keyer filter:

* Color Selection
* Matte Tools
* Spill Suppression
* Light Wrap

The first three are designed to clean up poorly shot keys – read the FCP X Help files to learn how these work. (I used the Color Selection tools to clean up the very dark key I use an example later in this article.)

Light wrap, though, is aesthetic. What it does is blend colors from the background into the edges of the foreground, to make the entire key look more "organic," as if the foreground and background were actually in the same space.

This is a subtle effect, but very cool.

![fx chroma 10](https://images.wondershare.com/multimedia/fx-chroma-10.jpg)

Twirl down Light Wrap and adjust the Amount slider and watch what happens. Drag the other sliders around and see what happens. The nice thing about this setting is that when it looks good to you, it is good. The amount of the effect is totally up to you. Remember, Light Wrap only affects the edges of the foreground and should be used subtly.

![fx chroma 11](https://images.wondershare.com/multimedia/fx-chroma-11.jpg)

When you are done, you have a great looking key!

## Clean up the Image with a Garbage Mask

![fx chroma 12](https://images.wondershare.com/multimedia/fx-chroma-12.jpg)

Sometimes, however, you don't have, ah, perhaps, the best green-screen image to work with. Here, for example, there are lighting instruments in the foreground, with a very inadequately lit green screen in the background. (Sigh… this is just pitiful.)

Once you pull the key – which is film-speak for creating a green-screen shot, as I described above – and get it looking as good as possible, there's one more step: adding a garbage matte to get rid of all the garbage surrounding your actors.

![fx chroma 13](https://images.wondershare.com/multimedia/fx-chroma-13.jpg)

Once you get your key looking as good as you can – which in this case isn't all that good – drag the Mask effect (**Effects > Keying > Mask**) on top of the green-screen clip.

**NOTE**: The Mask effect should always be added after the Keying effect, so that the Mask is below the Keyer in the Inspector.

![fx chroma 14](https://images.wondershare.com/multimedia/fx-chroma-14.jpg)

Then, drag each of the four circles to create a shape such that your foreground image is contained inside it, and everything you want to exclude is outside. Here, for instance, we removed the light stand, the edge of the green background and the tearing at the top of the image. I've found this Mask effect works best when applied to a connected clip.

However, the big limitation of the Mask effect is that you only have four points to work with. That's where a free effect comes in, which allows you to create far more flexible shapes with it. It's written by Alex Gollner and is available on his website – alex4d.wordpress.com/fcpx/ – I recommend his effects highly.

There are software and internet resources that can assist you in resolving this issue. You may brighten your movies without exerting any effort if you use the correct video brightener application or website. Read about some of this software when you want to learn more about brightening videos.

### **1\.** [**Veed.io**](https://www.veed.io/)

Is it too dark to watch your visuals? There is "light" at the end of the tunnel, so don't panic. You may alter the brightness, contrast, color distribution, backdrop, transparency, and more in your movie using Veed.io color, vibrancy, and flare may be added to your videos.

Alternatively, for a dramatic impact, lower it a little! Our expert brightness editor will bring out the finest in your video, no matter what it is. Launch your preferred web browser, such as Chrome, Opera, or Mozilla Firefox.

To brighten your videos, upload your video to VEED's video editor. Select 'Adjust' after clicking the video track. From left to right, move the Brightness key. You can make gorgeous videos for every social media site, especially intro videos, using VEED (with their Intro Maker). To stay on brand, include your emblem and your graphics.

### 2\. [**Kapwing**](https://www.kapwing.com/)

Another video brightener is Kapwing Video Editor, which brightens videos online without requiring any installations. There is a choice to enter a video URL to add light to the video when utilizing the following online effects to illuminate the video-sharing site.

You may also edit and brighten video by uploading it from your computer's hard disk. There are various more video-related tools available on the internet that assist you in beautifying films for social media posting.

Most of the functionality found in the other social network video editors on our list are available, including video templates, ways to resize and cut your video clips, text tools, and even some basic geometric shapes.

You may also convert, trim, resize, and loop videos with at least 15 video tools, many of which are incorporated with the main Studio software. You may perform everything for free and without any hassle. The subtitle tool, for example, is a fantastic tool that allows users to upload subtitles to the industry standard.SRT file.

### 3\. [**Clipchamp**](https://clipchamp.com/en/)

The first semi-professional video editor on this roster is Clipchamp. Clipchamp includes video templates for just about any scenario you can think of. The program also provides videos in a range of aspect ratios. There's also a good selection of stock audio and video.

You'll also receive a video converter, a video compressor, and a webcam recorder, as well as a few more tools for basic video handling. Essentially, the platform includes everything you'll need to create simple films without having to spend lots of money on technology.

Place your video on the timeline by dragging and dropping it. The editing menu will show when you click on the video. Click "Color Exposure" in the editing menu, and a window with four slider settings will display. To brighten the video, use the "Exposure" slider to the right.

### 4\. [**Clideo**](https://clideo.com/)

Clideo is a cute website that can be used to brighten up dreary films. This website allows you to modify video brightness for free, and you may use it without installing something on your computer. The site is free, but there are certain limits, so you'll need to upgrade to the premium version to use all of the features. Because it is online and operates straight in the browser, you may use it to adjust the brightness of your Windows 7 computer.

All you have to do now is upload the video from your computer that you wish to modify. You may upload up to 500 MBs in the free version. You'll find modification settings on the right when your movie has been uploaded. To lighten your video, drag the Brightness slider to the right. After you've made the necessary edits, you may save the movie to your computer.

## Part 2: Best Desktop Video Editors to Adjust Video Brightness

It's difficult to constantly record a video in great light, so you attempt to brighten a dark movie or modify the brightness of a video to make it appear better for sharing. For the majority of individuals, adjusting the video brightness is a time-consuming and even unpleasant experience in their everyday lives for a variety of reasons.

As a result, many people want to know which desktop video editors are the best for adjusting video brightness. Learn about the applications that can assist you in this endeavor by reading on.

### **1\.** [Wondershare Filmora Video Editor](https://tools.techidaily.com/wondershare/filmora/download/)

Wondershare Filmora is an excellent choice when you need to get started with simple video editing features while also having the possibility to progress. If you're concerned about dark videos, Filmora can comfortably solve the issue. Click on the Import option and choose the file of your liking. Then apply changes from the adjustment settings to make it look worthwhile!

[Try It Free](https://tools.techidaily.com/wondershare/filmora/download/)

For macOS 10.12 or later

Filmora video editor allows you to adjust the brightness with the auto enhance feature in one-click. What’s more, it provides the color match feature which allows you to match the color between different clips.

### **2\.** VSDC Free Video Editor

The VSDC Free Footage Editor, in the hands of a skilled user, can generate some truly professional-looking videos. The application supports virtually all major video formats and includes complex video effects such as object transformation and color correction, and also advanced audio effects such as volume adjustment and sound normalization. You have the luxury of brightening your videos simply by uploading the video from your desktop and making whatever changes that you want to make.

VSDC Free Video Editor is actually free, unlike certain "high-end" editors. You may utilize the whole feature set of the application without having to contend with annoying watermarks. Unfortunately, there is one snag. You must pay if you want technical assistance. (And there's a strong possibility you'll have to.) Subscription for the VSDC Free Video Editor is $1 per month, $5 per half-year, and $10 per year.

### **3\.** iMovie

iMovie for Mac allows you to experience your films in new ways. Make Hollywood-style teasers and gorgeous movies in excellent 4K resolution by quickly browsing your footage and instantly sharing your best moments. Color Balance and Color Correction are two options for brightening a movie in iMovie 10.1 or later. The former has four tabs: Auto, Match Color, White Balance, and Skin Tone Balance, which allow you to make automated color adjustments.

The latter has sliders for manually adjusting brightness, contrast, saturation, shadows, and other parameters. Simply choose the clip you want to change and then select the appropriate tool from the toolbar above the viewer. It's not very technical, but it makes it simple to brighten up a gloomy video.

### 4\. **Premiere** Pro CC

Premiere Pro includes a user interface that is both appealing and versatile. The startup feature enables you to rapidly return to previous projects, start new ones, or browse for Adobe Stock video. You can switch between workspaces for Assembly, Editing, Color, Effects, Audio, and Titles, and the dark system window tends to make your videos the focus of attention.

Premiere Pro CC is another desktop video editor that you can use to brighten your videos. The various parameters in the Lumetri Color panel window inside Premiere Pro CC may be used to accomplish video color correction.

Premiere Pro's Lumetri Color Tools elevate the application to the level of Photoshop for video. These tools provide a surprising amount of color modification and a wide range of film and HDR effects. With keyframes, you may modify the white balance, exposure, contrast, highlights, shadows, and black point, among other things. Modifications for Saturation, Vibrance, Faded Film and Sharpen are also accessible.

### 5\. Final Cut Pro

Final Cut Pro comes with a set of robust manual color correction features that can be used to achieve a wide range of color correction and enhancement features. Creating a color correction effect and then modifying the effect's settings in the Color inspector is how you utilize the tools. Any of the following color correction effects may be used to make manual color modifications to the color tint, brightness, and contrast of the entire clip picture.

Color correction capabilities in Final Cut Pro allow you to fine-tune the look of any video in your project, including still photos, by adjusting color balance, shadow levels, mid-tone thresholds, highlight levels, and much more. Saturation, exposure, and color modifications are all controlled via the Color Board. Adjust the Brightness in the color adjustment panels to brighten your movies.

**Conclusion**

Adjusting brightness has become a "small problem" for many. Oftentimes, you record a video, and it falls short of the brightness criteria – it's too dark! However, when you have quality **Video Brightness Editors**, like the ones we have reviewed above, you're in good hands. Not only are these apps easy to use with excellent functionality, but they also make editing a piece of cake for everyone.
