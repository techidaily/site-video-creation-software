<p>Figuring out which is the best security camera software is never easy. This is because most of the software you find online says it is free…until you download their software and it tries to charge you.</p>
<p>Here is a review of the best security camera software, and every single one has a free option. Share this article on social media if you find the right camera software for you.</p>
<p>But if you are new in this field, then you might want to know some basic technique terms introduced following, before we jump to choose the best security camera software.</p>
<h2 id="What-Is-an-IP-Camera"><a href="#What-Is-an-IP-Camera" class="headerlink" title="What Is an IP Camera?"></a>What Is an IP Camera?</h2><p>When people say, “IP camera,” they usually mean a camera that uses the Internet in some way so that it may do its job. A typical CCTV camera connects a camera to a computer via a wire. An IP camera can connect over the Internet.</p>
<p>Sometimes, the connection is remote. This means that the camera may be in one location and still be connected to another computer that is miles away.</p>
<p>However, many IP cameras are installed in a home and only travel a few feet&#x2F;meters to the nearest computer. In short, an IP camera doesn’t need a local recording device because the signal can be sent over the Internet or with a Wi-Fi connection.</p>
<h2 id="What-Is-Camera-Software-Used-for"><a href="#What-Is-Camera-Software-Used-for" class="headerlink" title="What Is Camera Software Used for?"></a>What Is Camera Software Used for?</h2><p>Most people and businesses use camera software to connect their cameras to their computers or their Smartphones. This is often cheaper than buying dedicated recording hardware. The camera and its software are usually used to monitor camera feeds that are life, and to records them onto a hard drive or to the Cloud.</p>
<h2 id="How-Do-You-Pick-the-Best-Security-Camera-Software"><a href="#How-Do-You-Pick-the-Best-Security-Camera-Software" class="headerlink" title="How Do You Pick the Best Security Camera Software?"></a>How Do You Pick the Best Security Camera Software?</h2><p>In most cases, the best software is simply the software that works with your cameras, and that offers all the functions you need. Compatibility is the first concern, but you also want it to work well with your device. For example, if your cameras have a zoom function, but your software doesn’t allow zooming, then that piece of software is not the best one for you.</p>
<p>For example, if you are using Linux, then you want Linux security camera software. And, some people insist that their software allows them to monitor their cameras from their Smartphones. The great thing about free security camera software is that you can test it out first without the risk of losing your money.</p>

<h4 id="1-NetCam-Studio"><a href="#1-NetCam-Studio" class="headerlink" title="1. NetCam Studio"></a>1. <a class="link"   target="_blank" rel="noopener" href="https://www.netcamstudio.com/Pricing" >NetCam Studio <i class="fa-regular fa-arrow-up-right-from-square fa-sm"></i></a></h4><p><img

                      alt="best free security camera software"
                ></p>
<p>There is a free version of NetCam Studio, but if you want something more powerful, then you can buy one of their licenses. These licenses allow you to use the software for as long as you like, and they will update the software for up to two years after purchase.</p>
<p>After the two-year period, you can keep the software running as normal, but if you want upgrades, then you will have to buy them. Upgrades shouldn’t be needed unless you buy a new piece of camera hardware and it requires a new type of camera software.</p>
<p><strong>The NetCam Studio Features</strong></p>
<p>If you go for the free version of NetCam Studio, then you get to use a camera feed from two sources. There is a watermark added to the camera images, and you get five-day notifications. There is also community support.</p>
<p>The paid features include up to 64 sources, no watermarks, 250-day notifications, and you get priority support. After the 250 days is up, you may buy upgrades in order to keep the notification system going.</p>
<p><strong>Pros</strong></p>
<p>The free version does not expire in any way besides the notifications</p>
<p>You are able to use this software with a wide variety of camera brands</p>
<p>Updates are frequent enough to tackle most system-breaking bugs</p>
<p><strong>Cons</strong></p>
<p>The interface needs updating to make it more user friendly</p>
<p>They need to better explain the “Add Source” procedure</p>
<p>Troubleshooting audio problems is very difficult</p>
<h4 id="2-Security-Eye"><a href="#2-Security-Eye" class="headerlink" title="2. Security Eye"></a>2. <a class="link"   target="_blank" rel="noopener" href="https://www.security-eye-software.com/" >Security Eye <i class="fa-regular fa-arrow-up-right-from-square fa-sm"></i></a></h4><p><img

                      alt="best free security camera software"
                ></p>
<p>The reason Security Eye ranks so highly is that it is a professional piece of software that somebody decided should be free. It is not open source security camera software, but the developers have decided that it should be free. There used to be a free version where you would get 2 hours of free surveillance per day for free, but in 2019 the company removed its payment system. Will they keep it up or go back to paid subscriptions? Who knows, but you should get it while it is still free (if you can).</p>
<p><strong>Security Eye Features</strong></p>
<p>You can use a timer to determine when the video feed should start. You can capture images as JPEGs and then compress them. The system also allows you to receive alerts via a loudspeaker. It works with motion-detection devices too.</p>
<p><strong>Pros</strong></p>
<p>It comes with the Xvid MPEG-4 Codec</p>
<p>The full version has no nag screen or recording limit</p>
<p>The Security Eye interface is pretty modern for what is essentially a free piece of software</p>
<p><strong>Cons</strong></p>
<p>Demands 1GB of RAM and 2GB of HHD space</p>
<p>Requires at least an Intel Pentium 1.8 processor</p>
<p>The icons should be more intuitive</p>
<h4 id="3-Perfect-Surveillance"><a href="#3-Perfect-Surveillance" class="headerlink" title="3.

                      alt="best free security camera software"
                ></p>
<p>There are three types of free security camera software for you to choose from. There is one for IP cameras, one for web cameras, and there is a piece of viewing software that people may use if they do not have something like VLC video viewer installed.</p>
<p><strong>Perfect Surveillance Features</strong></p>
<p>Simple icons and a clear interface is a great benefits. Determine when the cameras start monitoring and set up your own layouts to suit your viewing style.</p>
<p><strong>Pros</strong></p>
<p>A simple program that works in a very uncomplicated manner</p>
<p>Most of its icons are intuitive to where you can guess what they do</p>
<p>The Perfect Surveillance system has motion detection and allows you to monitor up to 64 devices</p>
<p><strong>Cons</strong></p>
<p>Installing seems overly long and bloated</p>
<p>There are not enough instructions on how to get your cameras connected</p>
<p>They do not explain how to capture and export screenshots</p>
<h4 id="4-iVideon"><a href="#4-iVideon" class="headerlink" title="4. iVideon"></a>4. <a class="link"   target="_blank" rel="noopener" href="https://www.ivideon.com/" >iVideon <i class="fa-regular fa-arrow-up-right-from-square fa-sm"></i></a></h4><p><img

                ></p>
<p>There are times when a piece of free software simply does its job good enough to warrant no complaints, and that is exactly what iVideon offers. There are plenty of ways it can be improved, but there is nothing about it that demands harsh criticism.</p>
<p><strong>iVideon Features</strong></p>
<p>One of its most advertised features is facial recognition, but it is not very accurate. It does allow for very good mobile usage. You can view live and recorded footage on your desktop or mobile device. It is also available for Mac OS X and Linux.</p>
<p><strong>Pros</strong></p>
<p>Online home use and access is completely full-featured and freeware</p>
<p>It has smart notifications and has its own desktop and mobile apps</p>
<p>it doesn’t take long to learn how to use the iVideon interface</p>
<p><strong>Cons</strong></p>
<p>Seems rather light on features</p>
<p>Installing and connecting cameras requires a better tutorial</p>
<p>Embedding live video on your website is trickier than it first seems</p>

                      alt="best free security camera software"
                ></p>
<p>This program has plenty of features, but most of them are locked off to free users. It takes over too long to learn how to use the system, but it may be worth it if you have many cameras. The paid version has all sorts of perks from SMS texts to system health monitoring.</p>
<p><strong>Xeoma Features</strong></p>
<p>The lite version is the free version. It allows you to add four cameras with up to six modules in each chain. You can test out and use the lite version as long as you like, or you can get a free trial of the larger fully-featured program.</p>
<p><strong>Pros</strong></p>
<p>Record and monitor from four cameras</p>
<p>Updates are very frequent</p>
<p>This software works with mostly every type of camera</p>
<p><strong>Cons</strong></p>
<p>Around 90% of features are locked off to free users.</p>
<p>Xeoma is difficult to learn and set up</p>
<p>Connecting many cameras is difficult because the system is difficult to learn as a whole</p>

                      alt="best free security camera software"
                ></p>
<p>The Genius Vision system is a fairly advanced piece of software that is probably best used for businesses. If used at home, then there are many features that may never be used. It also works on mobile devices too.</p>
<p><strong>Genius Vision Features</strong></p>
<p>There are plenty of features to play with, including a massive array of settings to fit the many types of camera that this program can be used with. You can even support the company through Patreon and get more extensions on the program.</p>
<p><strong>Pros</strong></p>
<p>Works in-depth with many types of camera</p>
<p>The tools are very sophisticated and accurate</p>
<p>The drop-down menus are complicated while also being thoughtfully laid out</p>
<p><strong>Cons</strong></p>
<p>Getting paid upgrades is trickier than just buying on their website</p>
<p>Setting up the remote features is difficult</p>
<p>You have to figure out most of how to use the program based on which camera you have connected</p>
<h4 id="7-Deskshare-IP-Camera-Viewer"><a href="#7-Deskshare-IP-Camera-Viewer" class="headerlink" title="7. Deskshare IP Camera Viewer"></a>7. <a class="link"   target="_blank" rel="noopener" href="https://www.deskshare.com/ip-camera-viewer.aspx" >Deskshare IP Camera Viewer <i class="fa-regular fa-arrow-up-right-from-square fa-sm"></i></a></h4><p><img

                      alt="best free security camera software"
                ></p>
<p>The Deskshare IP Camera Viewer company has a great piece of security camera software that they repackage into many different names and then give away on their website. They do this because the software comes with lots of unwanted bloatware that the company is paid to promote. The sad part is that many other websites will replace this bloatware with Trojan viruses, which means it is difficult to get a clean version of this program.</p>
<p><strong>Deskshare IP Camera Viewer Features</strong></p>
<p>Live recording, playback, and split-screen is all available. You can use up to 4 cameras at a time, and it works with 2200 different camera models. If your hardware allows it, then you can pan, tilt and zoom your camera.</p>
<p><strong>Pros</strong></p>
<p>It is compatible with many types of camera brand</p>
<p>You can set up floating surveillance windows if you want</p>
<p>Adjust the properties of each camera individually</p>
<p><strong>Cons</strong></p>
<p>Installing is very difficult to do correctly</p>
<p>Comes with bloatware and&#x2F;or unwanted content</p>
<p>The IP software has the least features of all the Deskshare camera software</p>
<h4 id="8-Anycam"><a href="#8-Anycam" class="headerlink" title="8. Anycam"></a>8. <a class="link"   target="_blank" rel="noopener" href="https://anycam.io/" >Anycam <i class="fa-regular fa-arrow-up-right-from-square fa-sm"></i></a></h4><p><img

                      alt="best free security camera software"
                ></p>
<p>The Anycam system is a very average piece of software, but it works with most any type of camera. The interface is basic but easy to use and easy to set up. You will discover that the free version is only limited in terms of record time, you can still use all its features.</p>
<p><strong>Anycam Features</strong></p>
<p>Anycam is mostly featureless. It works with motion-detection cameras. It allows for video recording and playback. Plus, you can watch a live feed. Other than that, there is very little you can do with this basic-but-effective piece of software.</p>
<p><strong>Pros</strong></p>
<p>The program seems to work with any type of camera</p>
<p>Anycam has a paid version where you only make a one-time payment and get free lifetime updates</p>
<p>Installing and setup is very easy</p>
<p><strong>Cons</strong></p>
<p>Trying to find specific events on the timeline is very fiddly</p>
<p>The free version only allows two cameras to be linked</p>
<p>The recording is very limited with the free version</p>
<h4 id="9-ContaCam"><a href="#9-ContaCam" class="headerlink" title="9. ContaCam"></a>9. <a class="link"   target="_blank" rel="noopener" href="https://www.contaware.com/donationware-license.html" >ContaCam <i class="fa-regular fa-arrow-up-right-from-square fa-sm"></i></a></h4><p><img

                      alt="best free security camera software"
                ></p>
<p>In the strictest terms, this piece of software is not free. The developers ask you for a donation, but there is nothing forcing you to give them one. Plus, you can try the software, and then if it turns out to be brilliant, then you can always go back and donate to them.</p>
<p><strong>ContaCam Features</strong></p>
<p>Despite seeming very complicated, the interface is actually very self-explanatory. At first glance, it looks overly condensed and full of features, but each explains itself very well. You can configure the cameras very precisely to the point where you can even specify within which seconds it starts and stops.</p>
<p><strong>Pros</strong></p>
<p>A rather advanced piece of software</p>
<p>The interface layout is very condensed without being confusing</p>
<p>You can use web servers, the Internet, or intranet to receive live feeds</p>
<p><strong>Cons</strong></p>
<p>The interface has no aesthetic decoration at all</p>
<p>ContaCam takes a long time to learn through trial and error testing</p>
<p>The developers say this will never work with mobile devices</p>
<h4 id="10-Agent-DVR"><a href="#10-Agent-DVR" class="headerlink" title="10.

                      alt="best free security camera software"
                ></p>
<p>The great thing about Agent DVR is that it is completely free because it is freeware. The sad part is that it was created by a developer who went on to finer things and left the program lodged on a few high-use servers. It is now being passed around freeware websites, which means it is sometimes difficult to find a clean version. Nevertheless, it is a fine piece of camera software that still works for many types of cameras.</p>
<p><strong>Agent DVR Features</strong></p>
<p>The Agent DVR software allows for video surveillance with a live feed, and for recording. You can use it with motion-detection software, and it still works for many different types of cameras. It uses a reliable SSL algorithm for its signal encryption, and it is very lightweight, which means it is not a big drain on your device’s CPU.</p>
<p><strong>Pros</strong></p>
<p>A very simple and lightweight piece of software</p>
<p>Works all the way back to Windows 7</p>
<p>It still works with motion detection systems</p>
<p><strong>Cons</strong></p>
<p>Agent DVR will become more obsolete as newer cameras appear over the coming years</p>
<p>Updates will never occur beyond Windows 10</p>
<p>The interface looks very dated compared to the modern camera software</p>
<h2 id="Conclusion"><a href="#Conclusion" class="headerlink" title="Conclusion"></a>Conclusion</h2><p>As you can tell by this article, getting good security camera software is difficult because there is so much to choose from. Plus, installing is often an issue, as is companies trying to nag-free users into paying. There is also the issue of connecting cameras and the problem with tagged-on viruses and bloatware.</p>
<p>Nevertheless, there is plenty to try without having to pay, so that is a positive. What do you think?</p>

For example, if your cameras have a zoom function, but your software doesn’t allow zooming, then that piece of software is not the best one for you.</p>
<p>For example, if you are using Linux, then you want Linux security camera software. And, some people insist that their software allows them to monitor their cameras from their Smartphones. The great thing about free security camera software is that you can test it out first without the risk of losing your money.</p>

<h4 id="1-NetCam-Studio-1"><a href="#1-NetCam-Studio-1" class="headerlink" title="1. NetCam Studio"></a>1. <a class="link"   target="_blank" rel="noopener" href="https://www.netcamstudio.com/Pricing" >NetCam Studio <i class="fa-regular fa-arrow-up-right-from-square fa-sm"></i></a></h4><p><img

                      alt="best free security camera software"
                ></p>
<p>There is a free version of NetCam Studio, but if you want something more powerful, then you can buy one of their licenses. These licenses allow you to use the software for as long as you like, and they will update the software for up to two years after purchase.</p>
<p>After the two-year period, you can keep the software running as normal, but if you want upgrades, then you will have to buy them. Upgrades shouldn’t be needed unless you buy a new piece of camera hardware and it requires a new type of camera software.</p>
<p><strong>The NetCam Studio Features</strong></p>
<p>If you go for the free version of NetCam Studio, then you get to use a camera feed from two sources. There is a watermark added to the camera images, and you get five-day notifications. There is also community support.</p>
<p>The paid features include up to 64 sources, no watermarks, 250-day notifications, and you get priority support. After the 250 days is up, you may buy upgrades in order to keep the notification system going.</p>
<p><strong>Pros</strong></p>
<p>The free version does not expire in any way besides the notifications</p>
<p>You are able to use this software with a wide variety of camera brands</p>
<p>Updates are frequent enough to tackle most system-breaking bugs</p>
<p><strong>Cons</strong></p>
<p>The interface needs updating to make it more user friendly</p>
<p>They need to better explain the “Add Source” procedure</p>
<p>Troubleshooting audio problems is very difficult</p>
<h4 id="2-Security-Eye-1"><a href="#2-Security-Eye-1" class="headerlink" title="2. Security Eye"></a>2. <a class="link"   target="_blank" rel="noopener" href="https://www.security-eye-software.com/" >Security Eye <i class="fa-regular fa-arrow-up-right-from-square fa-sm"></i></a></h4><p><img

                      alt="best free security camera software"
                ></p>
<p>The reason Security Eye ranks so highly is that it is a professional piece of software that somebody decided should be free. It is not open source security camera software, but the developers have decided that it should be free. There used to be a free version where you would get 2 hours of free surveillance per day for free, but in 2019 the company removed its payment system. Will they keep it up or go back to paid subscriptions? Who knows, but you should get it while it is still free (if you can).</p>
<p><strong>Security Eye Features</strong></p>
<p>You can use a timer to determine when the video feed should start. You can capture images as JPEGs and then compress them. The system also allows you to receive alerts via a loudspeaker. It works with motion-detection devices too.</p>
<p><strong>Pros</strong></p>
<p>It comes with the Xvid MPEG-4 Codec</p>
<p>The full version has no nag screen or recording limit</p>
<p>The Security Eye interface is pretty modern for what is essentially a free piece of software</p>
<p><strong>Cons</strong></p>
<p>Demands 1GB of RAM and 2GB of HHD space</p>
<p>Requires at least an Intel Pentium 1.8 processor</p>
<p>The icons should be more intuitive</p>
<h4 id="3-Perfect-Surveillance-1"><a href="#3-Perfect-Surveillance-1" class="headerlink" title="3.

                ></p>
<p>There are three types of free security camera software for you to choose from. There is one for IP cameras, one for web cameras, and there is a piece of viewing software that people may use if they do not have something like VLC video viewer installed.</p>
<p><strong>Perfect Surveillance Features</strong></p>
<p>Simple icons and a clear interface is a great benefits. Determine when the cameras start monitoring and set up your own layouts to suit your viewing style.</p>
<p><strong>Pros</strong></p>
<p>A simple program that works in a very uncomplicated manner</p>
<p>Most of its icons are intuitive to where you can guess what they do</p>
<p>The Perfect Surveillance system has motion detection and allows you to monitor up to 64 devices</p>
<p><strong>Cons</strong></p>
<p>Installing seems overly long and bloated</p>
<p>There are not enough instructions on how to get your cameras connected</p>
<p>They do not explain how to capture and export screenshots</p>
<h4 id="4-iVideon-1"><a href="#4-iVideon-1" class="headerlink" title="4. iVideon"></a>4. <a class="link"   target="_blank" rel="noopener" href="https://www.ivideon.com/" >iVideon <i class="fa-regular fa-arrow-up-right-from-square fa-sm"></i></a></h4><p><img

                ></p>
<p>There are times when a piece of free software simply does its job good enough to warrant no complaints, and that is exactly what iVideon offers. There are plenty of ways it can be improved, but there is nothing about it that demands harsh criticism.</p>
<p><strong>iVideon Features</strong></p>
<p>One of its most advertised features is facial recognition, but it is not very accurate. It does allow for very good mobile usage. You can view live and recorded footage on your desktop or mobile device. It is also available for Mac OS X and Linux.</p>
<p><strong>Pros</strong></p>
<p>Online home use and access is completely full-featured and freeware</p>
<p>It has smart notifications and has its own desktop and mobile apps</p>
<p>it doesn’t take long to learn how to use the iVideon interface</p>
<p><strong>Cons</strong></p>
<p>Seems rather light on features</p>
<p>Installing and connecting cameras requires a better tutorial</p>
<p>Embedding live video on your website is trickier than it first seems</p>

                      alt="best free security camera software"
                ></p>
<p>This program has plenty of features, but most of them are locked off to free users. It takes over too long to learn how to use the system, but it may be worth it if you have many cameras. The paid version has all sorts of perks from SMS texts to system health monitoring.</p>
<p><strong>Xeoma Features</strong></p>
<p>The lite version is the free version. It allows you to add four cameras with up to six modules in each chain. You can test out and use the lite version as long as you like, or you can get a free trial of the larger fully-featured program.</p>
<p><strong>Pros</strong></p>
<p>Record and monitor from four cameras</p>
<p>Updates are very frequent</p>
<p>This software works with mostly every type of camera</p>
<p><strong>Cons</strong></p>
<p>Around 90% of features are locked off to free users.</p>
<p>Xeoma is difficult to learn and set up</p>
<p>Connecting many cameras is difficult because the system is difficult to learn as a whole</p>

                      alt="best free security camera software"
                ></p>
<p>The Genius Vision system is a fairly advanced piece of software that is probably best used for businesses. If used at home, then there are many features that may never be used. It also works on mobile devices too.</p>
<p><strong>Genius Vision Features</strong></p>
<p>There are plenty of features to play with, including a massive array of settings to fit the many types of camera that this program can be used with. You can even support the company through Patreon and get more extensions on the program.</p>
<p><strong>Pros</strong></p>
<p>Works in-depth with many types of camera</p>
<p>The tools are very sophisticated and accurate</p>
<p>The drop-down menus are complicated while also being thoughtfully laid out</p>
<p><strong>Cons</strong></p>
<p>Getting paid upgrades is trickier than just buying on their website</p>
<p>Setting up the remote features is difficult</p>
<p>You have to figure out most of how to use the program based on which camera you have connected</p>
<h4 id="7-Deskshare-IP-Camera-Viewer-1"><a href="#7-Deskshare-IP-Camera-Viewer-1" class="headerlink" title="7.

                      alt="best free security camera software"
                ></p>
<p>The Deskshare IP Camera Viewer company has a great piece of security camera software that they repackage into many different names and then give away on their website. They do this because the software comes with lots of unwanted bloatware that the company is paid to promote. The sad part is that many other websites will replace this bloatware with Trojan viruses, which means it is difficult to get a clean version of this program.</p>
<p><strong>Deskshare IP Camera Viewer Features</strong></p>
<p>Live recording, playback, and split-screen is all available. You can use up to 4 cameras at a time, and it works with 2200 different camera models. If your hardware allows it, then you can pan, tilt and zoom your camera.</p>
<p><strong>Pros</strong></p>
<p>It is compatible with many types of camera brand</p>
<p>You can set up floating surveillance windows if you want</p>
<p>Adjust the properties of each camera individually</p>
<p><strong>Cons</strong></p>
<p>Installing is very difficult to do correctly</p>
<p>Comes with bloatware and&#x2F;or unwanted content</p>
<p>The IP software has the least features of all the Deskshare camera software</p>
<h4 id="8-Anycam-1"><a href="#8-Anycam-1" class="headerlink" title="8. Anycam"></a>8. <a class="link"   target="_blank" rel="noopener" href="https://anycam.io/" >Anycam <i class="fa-regular fa-arrow-up-right-from-square fa-sm"></i></a></h4><p><img

                      alt="best free security camera software"
                ></p>
<p>The Anycam system is a very average piece of software, but it works with most any type of camera. The interface is basic but easy to use and easy to set up. You will discover that the free version is only limited in terms of record time, you can still use all its features.</p>
<p><strong>Anycam Features</strong></p>
<p>Anycam is mostly featureless. It works with motion-detection cameras. It allows for video recording and playback. Plus, you can watch a live feed. Other than that, there is very little you can do with this basic-but-effective piece of software.</p>
<p><strong>Pros</strong></p>
<p>The program seems to work with any type of camera</p>
<p>Anycam has a paid version where you only make a one-time payment and get free lifetime updates</p>
<p>Installing and setup is very easy</p>
<p><strong>Cons</strong></p>
<p>Trying to find specific events on the timeline is very fiddly</p>
<p>The free version only allows two cameras to be linked</p>
<p>The recording is very limited with the free version</p>
<h4 id="9-ContaCam-1"><a href="#9-ContaCam-1" class="headerlink" title="9. ContaCam"></a>9. <a class="link"   target="_blank" rel="noopener" href="https://www.contaware.com/donationware-license.html" >ContaCam <i class="fa-regular fa-arrow-up-right-from-square fa-sm"></i></a></h4><p><img

                      alt="best free security camera software"
                ></p>
<p>In the strictest terms, this piece of software is not free. The developers ask you for a donation, but there is nothing forcing you to give them one. Plus, you can try the software, and then if it turns out to be brilliant, then you can always go back and donate to them.</p>
<p><strong>ContaCam Features</strong></p>
<p>Despite seeming very complicated, the interface is actually very self-explanatory. At first glance, it looks overly condensed and full of features, but each explains itself very well. You can configure the cameras very precisely to the point where you can even specify within which seconds it starts and stops.</p>
<p><strong>Pros</strong></p>
<p>A rather advanced piece of software</p>
<p>The interface layout is very condensed without being confusing</p>
<p>You can use web servers, the Internet, or intranet to receive live feeds</p>
<p><strong>Cons</strong></p>
<p>The interface has no aesthetic decoration at all</p>
<p>ContaCam takes a long time to learn through trial and error testing</p>
<p>The developers say this will never work with mobile devices</p>

                      alt="best free security camera software"
                ></p>
<p>The great thing about Agent DVR is that it is completely free because it is freeware. The sad part is that it was created by a developer who went on to finer things and left the program lodged on a few high-use servers. It is now being passed around freeware websites, which means it is sometimes difficult to find a clean version. Nevertheless, it is a fine piece of camera software that still works for many types of cameras.</p>
<p><strong>Agent DVR Features</strong></p>
<p>The Agent DVR software allows for video surveillance with a live feed, and for recording. You can use it with motion-detection software, and it still works for many different types of cameras. It uses a reliable SSL algorithm for its signal encryption, and it is very lightweight, which means it is not a big drain on your device’s CPU.</p>
<p><strong>Pros</strong></p>
<p>A very simple and lightweight piece of software</p>
<p>Works all the way back to Windows 7</p>
<p>It still works with motion detection systems</p>
<p><strong>Cons</strong></p>
<p>Agent DVR will become more obsolete as newer cameras appear over the coming years</p>
<p>Updates will never occur beyond Windows 10</p>
<p>The interface looks very dated compared to the modern camera software</p>
<h2 id="Conclusion-1"><a href="#Conclusion-1" class="headerlink" title="Conclusion"></a>Conclusion</h2><p>As you can tell by this article, getting good security camera software is difficult because there is so much to choose from. Plus, installing is often an issue, as is companies trying to nag-free users into paying. There is also the issue of connecting cameras and the problem with tagged-on viruses and bloatware.</p>
<p>Nevertheless, there is plenty to try without having to pay, so that is a positive. What do you think?</p>

<p>Figuring out which is the best security camera software is never easy. This is because most of the software you find online says it is free…until you download their software and it tries to charge you.</p>
<p>Here is a review of the best security camera software, and every single one has a free option. Share this article on social media if you find the right camera software for you.</p>
<p>But if you are new in this field, then you might want to know some basic technique terms introduced following, before we jump to choose the best security camera software.</p>
<h2 id="What-Is-an-IP-Camera-2"><a href="#What-Is-an-IP-Camera-2" class="headerlink" title="What Is an IP Camera?"></a>What Is an IP Camera?</h2><p>When people say, “IP camera,” they usually mean a camera that uses the Internet in some way so that it may do its job. A typical CCTV camera connects a camera to a computer via a wire. An IP camera can connect over the Internet.</p>
<p>Sometimes, the connection is remote. This means that the camera may be in one location and still be connected to another computer that is miles away.</p>
<p>However, many IP cameras are installed in a home and only travel a few feet&#x2F;meters to the nearest computer. In short, an IP camera doesn’t need a local recording device because the signal can be sent over the Internet or with a Wi-Fi connection.</p>
<h2 id="What-Is-Camera-Software-Used-for-2"><a href="#What-Is-Camera-Software-Used-for-2" class="headerlink" title="What Is Camera Software Used for?"></a>What Is Camera Software Used for?</h2><p>Most people and businesses use camera software to connect their cameras to their computers or their Smartphones. This is often cheaper than buying dedicated recording hardware. The camera and its software are usually used to monitor camera feeds that are life, and to records them onto a hard drive or to the Cloud.</p>
<h2 id="How-Do-You-Pick-the-Best-Security-Camera-Software-2"><a href="#How-Do-You-Pick-the-Best-Security-Camera-Software-2" class="headerlink" title="How Do You Pick the Best Security Camera Software?"></a>How Do You Pick the Best Security Camera Software?</h2><p>In most cases, the best software is simply the software that works with your cameras, and that offers all the functions you need. Compatibility is the first concern, but you also want it to work well with your device. For example, if your cameras have a zoom function, but your software doesn’t allow zooming, then that piece of software is not the best one for you.</p>
<p>For example, if you are using Linux, then you want Linux security camera software. And, some people insist that their software allows them to monitor their cameras from their Smartphones. The great thing about free security camera software is that you can test it out first without the risk of losing your money.</p>

<h4 id="1-NetCam-Studio-2"><a href="#1-NetCam-Studio-2" class="headerlink" title="1. NetCam Studio"></a>1. <a class="link"   target="_blank" rel="noopener" href="https://www.netcamstudio.com/Pricing" >NetCam Studio <i class="fa-regular fa-arrow-up-right-from-square fa-sm"></i></a></h4><p><img

                     data-src="https://images.wondershare.com/filmora/article-images/netcam-studio.jpg"
                      alt="best free security camera software"
                ></p>
<p>There is a free version of NetCam Studio, but if you want something more powerful, then you can buy one of their licenses. These licenses allow you to use the software for as long as you like, and they will update the software for up to two years after purchase.</p>
<p>After the two-year period, you can keep the software running as normal, but if you want upgrades, then you will have to buy them. Upgrades shouldn’t be needed unless you buy a new piece of camera hardware and it requires a new type of camera software.</p>
<p><strong>The NetCam Studio Features</strong></p>
<p>If you go for the free version of NetCam Studio, then you get to use a camera feed from two sources. There is a watermark added to the camera images, and you get five-day notifications. There is also community support.</p>
<p>The paid features include up to 64 sources, no watermarks, 250-day notifications, and you get priority support. After the 250 days is up, you may buy upgrades in order to keep the notification system going.</p>
<p><strong>Pros</strong></p>
<p>The free version does not expire in any way besides the notifications</p>
<p>You are able to use this software with a wide variety of camera brands</p>
<p>Updates are frequent enough to tackle most system-breaking bugs</p>
<p><strong>Cons</strong></p>
<p>The interface needs updating to make it more user friendly</p>
<p>They need to better explain the “Add Source” procedure</p>
<p>Troubleshooting audio problems is very difficult</p>
<h4 id="2-Security-Eye-2"><a href="#2-Security-Eye-2" class="headerlink" title="2. Security Eye"></a>2. <a class="link"   target="_blank" rel="noopener" href="https://www.security-eye-software.com/" >Security Eye <i class="fa-regular fa-arrow-up-right-from-square fa-sm"></i></a></h4><p><img

                      alt="best free security camera software"
                ></p>
<p>The reason Security Eye ranks so highly is that it is a professional piece of software that somebody decided should be free. It is not open source security camera software, but the developers have decided that it should be free. There used to be a free version where you would get 2 hours of free surveillance per day for free, but in 2019 the company removed its payment system. Will they keep it up or go back to paid subscriptions? Who knows, but you should get it while it is still free (if you can).</p>
<p><strong>Security Eye Features</strong></p>
<p>You can use a timer to determine when the video feed should start. You can capture images as JPEGs and then compress them. The system also allows you to receive alerts via a loudspeaker. It works with motion-detection devices too.</p>
<p><strong>Pros</strong></p>
<p>It comes with the Xvid MPEG-4 Codec</p>
<p>The full version has no nag screen or recording limit</p>
<p>The Security Eye interface is pretty modern for what is essentially a free piece of software</p>
<p><strong>Cons</strong></p>
<p>Demands 1GB of RAM and 2GB of HHD space</p>
<p>Requires at least an Intel Pentium 1.8 processor</p>
<p>The icons should be more intuitive</p>
<h4 id="3-Perfect-Surveillance-2"><a href="#3-Perfect-Surveillance-2" class="headerlink" title="3.

                      alt="best free security camera software"
                ></p>
<p>There are three types of free security camera software for you to choose from. There is one for IP cameras, one for web cameras, and there is a piece of viewing software that people may use if they do not have something like VLC video viewer installed.</p>
<p><strong>Perfect Surveillance Features</strong></p>
<p>Simple icons and a clear interface is a great benefits. Determine when the cameras start monitoring and set up your own layouts to suit your viewing style.</p>
<p><strong>Pros</strong></p>
<p>A simple program that works in a very uncomplicated manner</p>
<p>Most of its icons are intuitive to where you can guess what they do</p>
<p>The Perfect Surveillance system has motion detection and allows you to monitor up to 64 devices</p>
<p><strong>Cons</strong></p>
<p>Installing seems overly long and bloated</p>
<p>There are not enough instructions on how to get your cameras connected</p>
<p>They do not explain how to capture and export screenshots</p>
<h4 id="4-iVideon-2"><a href="#4-iVideon-2" class="headerlink" title="4. iVideon"></a>4. <a class="link"   target="_blank" rel="noopener" href="https://www.ivideon.com/" >iVideon <i class="fa-regular fa-arrow-up-right-from-square fa-sm"></i></a></h4><p><img

                      alt="best free security camera software"
                ></p>
<p>There are times when a piece of free software simply does its job good enough to warrant no complaints, and that is exactly what iVideon offers. There are plenty of ways it can be improved, but there is nothing about it that demands harsh criticism.</p>
<p><strong>iVideon Features</strong></p>
<p>One of its most advertised features is facial recognition, but it is not very accurate. It does allow for very good mobile usage. You can view live and recorded footage on your desktop or mobile device. It is also available for Mac OS X and Linux.</p>
<p><strong>Pros</strong></p>
<p>Online home use and access is completely full-featured and freeware</p>
<p>It has smart notifications and has its own desktop and mobile apps</p>
<p>it doesn’t take long to learn how to use the iVideon interface</p>
<p><strong>Cons</strong></p>
<p>Seems rather light on features</p>
<p>Installing and connecting cameras requires a better tutorial</p>
<p>Embedding live video on your website is trickier than it first seems</p>

                      alt="best free security camera software"
                ></p>
<p>This program has plenty of features, but most of them are locked off to free users. It takes over too long to learn how to use the system, but it may be worth it if you have many cameras. The paid version has all sorts of perks from SMS texts to system health monitoring.</p>
<p><strong>Xeoma Features</strong></p>
<p>The lite version is the free version. It allows you to add four cameras with up to six modules in each chain. You can test out and use the lite version as long as you like, or you can get a free trial of the larger fully-featured program.</p>
<p><strong>Pros</strong></p>
<p>Record and monitor from four cameras</p>
<p>Updates are very frequent</p>
<p>This software works with mostly every type of camera</p>
<p><strong>Cons</strong></p>
<p>Around 90% of features are locked off to free users.</p>
<p>Xeoma is difficult to learn and set up</p>
<p>Connecting many cameras is difficult because the system is difficult to learn as a whole</p>

                      alt="best free security camera software"
                ></p>
<p>The Genius Vision system is a fairly advanced piece of software that is probably best used for businesses. If used at home, then there are many features that may never be used. It also works on mobile devices too.</p>
<p><strong>Genius Vision Features</strong></p>
<p>There are plenty of features to play with, including a massive array of settings to fit the many types of camera that this program can be used with. You can even support the company through Patreon and get more extensions on the program.</p>
<p><strong>Pros</strong></p>
<p>Works in-depth with many types of camera</p>
<p>The tools are very sophisticated and accurate</p>
<p>The drop-down menus are complicated while also being thoughtfully laid out</p>
<p><strong>Cons</strong></p>
<p>Getting paid upgrades is trickier than just buying on their website</p>
<p>Setting up the remote features is difficult</p>
<p>You have to figure out most of how to use the program based on which camera you have connected</p>
<h4 id="7-Deskshare-IP-Camera-Viewer-2"><a href="#7-Deskshare-IP-Camera-Viewer-2" class="headerlink" title="7.

                      alt="best free security camera software"
                ></p>
<p>The Deskshare IP Camera Viewer company has a great piece of security camera software that they repackage into many different names and then give away on their website. They do this because the software comes with lots of unwanted bloatware that the company is paid to promote. The sad part is that many other websites will replace this bloatware with Trojan viruses, which means it is difficult to get a clean version of this program.</p>
<p><strong>Deskshare IP Camera Viewer Features</strong></p>
<p>Live recording, playback, and split-screen is all available. You can use up to 4 cameras at a time, and it works with 2200 different camera models. If your hardware allows it, then you can pan, tilt and zoom your camera.</p>
<p><strong>Pros</strong></p>
<p>It is compatible with many types of camera brand</p>
<p>You can set up floating surveillance windows if you want</p>
<p>Adjust the properties of each camera individually</p>
<p><strong>Cons</strong></p>
<p>Installing is very difficult to do correctly</p>
<p>Comes with bloatware and&#x2F;or unwanted content</p>
<p>The IP software has the least features of all the Deskshare camera software</p>
<h4 id="8-Anycam-2"><a href="#8-Anycam-2" class="headerlink" title="8. Anycam"></a>8. <a class="link"   target="_blank" rel="noopener" href="https://anycam.io/" >Anycam <i class="fa-regular fa-arrow-up-right-from-square fa-sm"></i></a></h4><p><img

                      alt="best free security camera software"
                ></p>
<p>The Anycam system is a very average piece of software, but it works with most any type of camera. The interface is basic but easy to use and easy to set up. You will discover that the free version is only limited in terms of record time, you can still use all its features.</p>
<p><strong>Anycam Features</strong></p>
<p>Anycam is mostly featureless. It works with motion-detection cameras. It allows for video recording and playback. Plus, you can watch a live feed. Other than that, there is very little you can do with this basic-but-effective piece of software.</p>
<p><strong>Pros</strong></p>
<p>The program seems to work with any type of camera</p>
<p>Anycam has a paid version where you only make a one-time payment and get free lifetime updates</p>
<p>Installing and setup is very easy</p>
<p><strong>Cons</strong></p>
<p>Trying to find specific events on the timeline is very fiddly</p>
<p>The free version only allows two cameras to be linked</p>
<p>The recording is very limited with the free version</p>
<h4 id="9-ContaCam-2"><a href="#9-ContaCam-2" class="headerlink" title="9. ContaCam"></a>9. <a class="link"   target="_blank" rel="noopener" href="https://www.contaware.com/donationware-license.html" >ContaCam <i class="fa-regular fa-arrow-up-right-from-square fa-sm"></i></a></h4><p><img

                      alt="best free security camera software"
                ></p>
<p>In the strictest terms, this piece of software is not free. The developers ask you for a donation, but there is nothing forcing you to give them one. Plus, you can try the software, and then if it turns out to be brilliant, then you can always go back and donate to them.</p>
<p><strong>ContaCam Features</strong></p>
<p>Despite seeming very complicated, the interface is actually very self-explanatory. At first glance, it looks overly condensed and full of features, but each explains itself very well. You can configure the cameras very precisely to the point where you can even specify within which seconds it starts and stops.</p>
<p><strong>Pros</strong></p>
<p>A rather advanced piece of software</p>
<p>The interface layout is very condensed without being confusing</p>
<p>You can use web servers, the Internet, or intranet to receive live feeds</p>
<p><strong>Cons</strong></p>
<p>The interface has no aesthetic decoration at all</p>
<p>ContaCam takes a long time to learn through trial and error testing</p>
<p>The developers say this will never work with mobile devices</p>
<h4 id="10-Agent-DVR-2"><a href="#10-Agent-DVR-2" class="headerlink" title="10.

                      alt="best free security camera software"
                ></p>
<p>The great thing about Agent DVR is that it is completely free because it is freeware. The sad part is that it was created by a developer who went on to finer things and left the program lodged on a few high-use servers. It is now being passed around freeware websites, which means it is sometimes difficult to find a clean version. Nevertheless, it is a fine piece of camera software that still works for many types of cameras.</p>
<p><strong>Agent DVR Features</strong></p>
<p>The Agent DVR software allows for video surveillance with a live feed, and for recording. You can use it with motion-detection software, and it still works for many different types of cameras. It uses a reliable SSL algorithm for its signal encryption, and it is very lightweight, which means it is not a big drain on your device’s CPU.</p>
<p><strong>Pros</strong></p>
<p>A very simple and lightweight piece of software</p>
<p>Works all the way back to Windows 7</p>
<p>It still works with motion detection systems</p>
<p><strong>Cons</strong></p>
<p>Agent DVR will become more obsolete as newer cameras appear over the coming years</p>
<p>Updates will never occur beyond Windows 10</p>
<p>The interface looks very dated compared to the modern camera software</p>
<h2 id="Conclusion-2"><a href="#Conclusion-2" class="headerlink" title="Conclusion"></a>Conclusion</h2><p>As you can tell by this article, getting good security camera software is difficult because there is so much to choose from. Plus, installing is often an issue, as is companies trying to nag-free users into paying. There is also the issue of connecting cameras and the problem with tagged-on viruses and bloatware.</p>
<p>Nevertheless, there is plenty to try without having to pay, so that is a positive. What do you think?</p>

<p>Figuring out which is the best security camera software is never easy. This is because most of the software you find online says it is free…until you download their software and it tries to charge you.</p>
<p>Here is a review of the best security camera software, and every single one has a free option. Share this article on social media if you find the right camera software for you.</p>
<p>But if you are new in this field, then you might want to know some basic technique terms introduced following, before we jump to choose the best security camera software.</p>
<h2 id="What-Is-an-IP-Camera-3"><a href="#What-Is-an-IP-Camera-3" class="headerlink" title="What Is an IP Camera?"></a>What Is an IP Camera?</h2><p>When people say, “IP camera,” they usually mean a camera that uses the Internet in some way so that it may do its job. A typical CCTV camera connects a camera to a computer via a wire. An IP camera can connect over the Internet.</p>
<p>Sometimes, the connection is remote. This means that the camera may be in one location and still be connected to another computer that is miles away.</p>
<p>However, many IP cameras are installed in a home and only travel a few feet&#x2F;meters to the nearest computer. In short, an IP camera doesn’t need a local recording device because the signal can be sent over the Internet or with a Wi-Fi connection.</p>
<h2 id="What-Is-Camera-Software-Used-for-3"><a href="#What-Is-Camera-Software-Used-for-3" class="headerlink" title="What Is Camera Software Used for?"></a>What Is Camera Software Used for?</h2><p>Most people and businesses use camera software to connect their cameras to their computers or their Smartphones. This is often cheaper than buying dedicated recording hardware. The camera and its software are usually used to monitor camera feeds that are life, and to records them onto a hard drive or to the Cloud.</p>
<h2 id="How-Do-You-Pick-the-Best-Security-Camera-Software-3"><a href="#How-Do-You-Pick-the-Best-Security-Camera-Software-3" class="headerlink" title="How Do You Pick the Best Security Camera Software?"></a>How Do You Pick the Best Security Camera Software?</h2><p>In most cases, the best software is simply the software that works with your cameras, and that offers all the functions you need. Compatibility is the first concern, but you also want it to work well with your device. For example, if your cameras have a zoom function, but your software doesn’t allow zooming, then that piece of software is not the best one for you.</p>
<p>For example, if you are using Linux, then you want Linux security camera software. And, some people insist that their software allows them to monitor their cameras from their Smartphones. The great thing about free security camera software is that you can test it out first without the risk of losing your money.</p>

<h4 id="1-NetCam-Studio-3"><a href="#1-NetCam-Studio-3" class="headerlink" title="1. NetCam Studio"></a>1. <a class="link"   target="_blank" rel="noopener" href="https://www.netcamstudio.com/Pricing" >NetCam Studio <i class="fa-regular fa-arrow-up-right-from-square fa-sm"></i></a></h4><p><img

                      alt="best free security camera software"
                ></p>
<p>There is a free version of NetCam Studio, but if you want something more powerful, then you can buy one of their licenses. These licenses allow you to use the software for as long as you like, and they will update the software for up to two years after purchase.</p>
<p>After the two-year period, you can keep the software running as normal, but if you want upgrades, then you will have to buy them. Upgrades shouldn’t be needed unless you buy a new piece of camera hardware and it requires a new type of camera software.</p>
<p><strong>The NetCam Studio Features</strong></p>
<p>If you go for the free version of NetCam Studio, then you get to use a camera feed from two sources. There is a watermark added to the camera images, and you get five-day notifications. There is also community support.</p>
<p>The paid features include up to 64 sources, no watermarks, 250-day notifications, and you get priority support. After the 250 days is up, you may buy upgrades in order to keep the notification system going.</p>
<p><strong>Pros</strong></p>
<p>The free version does not expire in any way besides the notifications</p>
<p>You are able to use this software with a wide variety of camera brands</p>
<p>Updates are frequent enough to tackle most system-breaking bugs</p>
<p><strong>Cons</strong></p>
<p>The interface needs updating to make it more user friendly</p>
<p>They need to better explain the “Add Source” procedure</p>
<p>Troubleshooting audio problems is very difficult</p>
<h4 id="2-Security-Eye-3"><a href="#2-Security-Eye-3" class="headerlink" title="2. Security Eye"></a>2. <a class="link"   target="_blank" rel="noopener" href="https://www.security-eye-software.com/" >Security Eye <i class="fa-regular fa-arrow-up-right-from-square fa-sm"></i></a></h4><p><img

                      alt="best free security camera software"
                ></p>
<p>The reason Security Eye ranks so highly is that it is a professional piece of software that somebody decided should be free. It is not open source security camera software, but the developers have decided that it should be free. There used to be a free version where you would get 2 hours of free surveillance per day for free, but in 2019 the company removed its payment system. Will they keep it up or go back to paid subscriptions? Who knows, but you should get it while it is still free (if you can).</p>
<p><strong>Security Eye Features</strong></p>
<p>You can use a timer to determine when the video feed should start. You can capture images as JPEGs and then compress them. The system also allows you to receive alerts via a loudspeaker. It works with motion-detection devices too.</p>
<p><strong>Pros</strong></p>
<p>It comes with the Xvid MPEG-4 Codec</p>
<p>The full version has no nag screen or recording limit</p>
<p>The Security Eye interface is pretty modern for what is essentially a free piece of software</p>
<p><strong>Cons</strong></p>
<p>Demands 1GB of RAM and 2GB of HHD space</p>
<p>Requires at least an Intel Pentium 1.8 processor</p>
<p>The icons should be more intuitive</p>
<h4 id="3-Perfect-Surveillance-3"><a href="#3-Perfect-Surveillance-3" class="headerlink" title="3.

                ></p>
<p>There are three types of free security camera software for you to choose from. There is one for IP cameras, one for web cameras, and there is a piece of viewing software that people may use if they do not have something like VLC video viewer installed.</p>
<p><strong>Perfect Surveillance Features</strong></p>
<p>Simple icons and a clear interface is a great benefits. Determine when the cameras start monitoring and set up your own layouts to suit your viewing style.</p>
<p><strong>Pros</strong></p>
<p>A simple program that works in a very uncomplicated manner</p>
<p>Most of its icons are intuitive to where you can guess what they do</p>
<p>The Perfect Surveillance system has motion detection and allows you to monitor up to 64 devices</p>
<p><strong>Cons</strong></p>
<p>Installing seems overly long and bloated</p>
<p>There are not enough instructions on how to get your cameras connected</p>
<p>They do not explain how to capture and export screenshots</p>
<h4 id="4-iVideon-3"><a href="#4-iVideon-3" class="headerlink" title="4. iVideon"></a>4. <a class="link"   target="_blank" rel="noopener" href="https://www.ivideon.com/" >iVideon <i class="fa-regular fa-arrow-up-right-from-square fa-sm"></i></a></h4><p><img

                      alt="best free security camera software"
                ></p>
<p>There are times when a piece of free software simply does its job good enough to warrant no complaints, and that is exactly what iVideon offers. There are plenty of ways it can be improved, but there is nothing about it that demands harsh criticism.</p>
<p><strong>iVideon Features</strong></p>
<p>One of its most advertised features is facial recognition, but it is not very accurate. It does allow for very good mobile usage. You can view live and recorded footage on your desktop or mobile device. It is also available for Mac OS X and Linux.</p>
<p><strong>Pros</strong></p>
<p>Online home use and access is completely full-featured and freeware</p>
<p>It has smart notifications and has its own desktop and mobile apps</p>
<p>it doesn’t take long to learn how to use the iVideon interface</p>
<p><strong>Cons</strong></p>
<p>Seems rather light on features</p>
<p>Installing and connecting cameras requires a better tutorial</p>
<p>Embedding live video on your website is trickier than it first seems</p>
<h4 id="5-Xeoma-3"><a href="#5-Xeoma-3" class="headerlink" title="5. Xeoma"></a>5. <a class="link"   target="_blank" rel="noopener" href="https://felenasoft.com/xeoma/en/" >Xeoma <i class="fa-regular fa-arrow-up-right-from-square fa-sm"></i></a></h4><p><img

                      alt="best free security camera software"
                ></p>
<p>This program has plenty of features, but most of them are locked off to free users. It takes over too long to learn how to use the system, but it may be worth it if you have many cameras. The paid version has all sorts of perks from SMS texts to system health monitoring.</p>
<p><strong>Xeoma Features</strong></p>
<p>The lite version is the free version. It allows you to add four cameras with up to six modules in each chain. You can test out and use the lite version as long as you like, or you can get a free trial of the larger fully-featured program.</p>
<p><strong>Pros</strong></p>
<p>Record and monitor from four cameras</p>
<p>Updates are very frequent</p>
<p>This software works with mostly every type of camera</p>
<p><strong>Cons</strong></p>
<p>Around 90% of features are locked off to free users.</p>
<p>Xeoma is difficult to learn and set up</p>
<p>Connecting many cameras is difficult because the system is difficult to learn as a whole</p>

                      alt="best free security camera software"
                ></p>
<p>The Genius Vision system is a fairly advanced piece of software that is probably best used for businesses. If used at home, then there are many features that may never be used. It also works on mobile devices too.</p>
<p><strong>Genius Vision Features</strong></p>
<p>There are plenty of features to play with, including a massive array of settings to fit the many types of camera that this program can be used with. You can even support the company through Patreon and get more extensions on the program.</p>
<p><strong>Pros</strong></p>
<p>Works in-depth with many types of camera</p>
<p>The tools are very sophisticated and accurate</p>
<p>The drop-down menus are complicated while also being thoughtfully laid out</p>
<p><strong>Cons</strong></p>
<p>Getting paid upgrades is trickier than just buying on their website</p>
<p>Setting up the remote features is difficult</p>
<p>You have to figure out most of how to use the program based on which camera you have connected</p>
<h4 id="7-Deskshare-IP-Camera-Viewer-3"><a href="#7-Deskshare-IP-Camera-Viewer-3" class="headerlink" title="7.

                      alt="best free security camera software"
                ></p>
<p>The Deskshare IP Camera Viewer company has a great piece of security camera software that they repackage into many different names and then give away on their website. They do this because the software comes with lots of unwanted bloatware that the company is paid to promote. The sad part is that many other websites will replace this bloatware with Trojan viruses, which means it is difficult to get a clean version of this program.</p>
<p><strong>Deskshare IP Camera Viewer Features</strong></p>
<p>Live recording, playback, and split-screen is all available. You can use up to 4 cameras at a time, and it works with 2200 different camera models. If your hardware allows it, then you can pan, tilt and zoom your camera.</p>
<p><strong>Pros</strong></p>
<p>It is compatible with many types of camera brand</p>
<p>You can set up floating surveillance windows if you want</p>
<p>Adjust the properties of each camera individually</p>
<p><strong>Cons</strong></p>
<p>Installing is very difficult to do correctly</p>
<p>Comes with bloatware and&#x2F;or unwanted content</p>
<p>The IP software has the least features of all the Deskshare camera software</p>
<h4 id="8-Anycam-3"><a href="#8-Anycam-3" class="headerlink" title="8. Anycam"></a>8. <a class="link"   target="_blank" rel="noopener" href="https://anycam.io/" >Anycam <i class="fa-regular fa-arrow-up-right-from-square fa-sm"></i></a></h4><p><img

                      alt="best free security camera software"
                ></p>
<p>The Anycam system is a very average piece of software, but it works with most any type of camera. The interface is basic but easy to use and easy to set up. You will discover that the free version is only limited in terms of record time, you can still use all its features.</p>
<p><strong>Anycam Features</strong></p>
<p>Anycam is mostly featureless. It works with motion-detection cameras. It allows for video recording and playback. Plus, you can watch a live feed. Other than that, there is very little you can do with this basic-but-effective piece of software.</p>
<p><strong>Pros</strong></p>
<p>The program seems to work with any type of camera</p>
<p>Anycam has a paid version where you only make a one-time payment and get free lifetime updates</p>
<p>Installing and setup is very easy</p>
<p><strong>Cons</strong></p>
<p>Trying to find specific events on the timeline is very fiddly</p>
<p>The free version only allows two cameras to be linked</p>
<p>The recording is very limited with the free version</p>
<h4 id="9-ContaCam-3"><a href="#9-ContaCam-3" class="headerlink" title="9. ContaCam"></a>9. <a class="link"   target="_blank" rel="noopener" href="https://www.contaware.com/donationware-license.html" >ContaCam <i class="fa-regular fa-arrow-up-right-from-square fa-sm"></i></a></h4><p><img

                      alt="best free security camera software"
                ></p>
<p>In the strictest terms, this piece of software is not free. The developers ask you for a donation, but there is nothing forcing you to give them one. Plus, you can try the software, and then if it turns out to be brilliant, then you can always go back and donate to them.</p>
<p><strong>ContaCam Features</strong></p>
<p>Despite seeming very complicated, the interface is actually very self-explanatory. At first glance, it looks overly condensed and full of features, but each explains itself very well. You can configure the cameras very precisely to the point where you can even specify within which seconds it starts and stops.</p>
<p><strong>Pros</strong></p>
<p>A rather advanced piece of software</p>
<p>The interface layout is very condensed without being confusing</p>
<p>You can use web servers, the Internet, or intranet to receive live feeds</p>
<p><strong>Cons</strong></p>
<p>The interface has no aesthetic decoration at all</p>
<p>ContaCam takes a long time to learn through trial and error testing</p>
<p>The developers say this will never work with mobile devices</p>
<h4 id="10-Agent-DVR-3"><a href="#10-Agent-DVR-3" class="headerlink" title="10.

                      alt="best free security camera software"
                ></p>
<p>The great thing about Agent DVR is that it is completely free because it is freeware. The sad part is that it was created by a developer who went on to finer things and left the program lodged on a few high-use servers. It is now being passed around freeware websites, which means it is sometimes difficult to find a clean version. Nevertheless, it is a fine piece of camera software that still works for many types of cameras.</p>
<p><strong>Agent DVR Features</strong></p>
<p>The Agent DVR software allows for video surveillance with a live feed, and for recording. You can use it with motion-detection software, and it still works for many different types of cameras. It uses a reliable SSL algorithm for its signal encryption, and it is very lightweight, which means it is not a big drain on your device’s CPU.</p>
<p><strong>Pros</strong></p>
<p>A very simple and lightweight piece of software</p>
<p>Works all the way back to Windows 7</p>
<p>It still works with motion detection systems</p>
<p><strong>Cons</strong></p>
<p>Agent DVR will become more obsolete as newer cameras appear over the coming years</p>
<p>Updates will never occur beyond Windows 10</p>
<p>The interface looks very dated compared to the modern camera software</p>
<h2 id="Conclusion-3"><a href="#Conclusion-3" class="headerlink" title="Conclusion"></a>Conclusion</h2><p>As you can tell by this article, getting good security camera software is difficult because there is so much to choose from. Plus, installing is often an issue, as is companies trying to nag-free users into paying. There is also the issue of connecting cameras and the problem with tagged-on viruses and bloatware.</p>
<p>Nevertheless, there is plenty to try without having to pay, so that is a positive. What do you think?</p>
<p>Have any of these worked for you? Ask your friends on social media, start a discussion, and share this article to help others discover the best free security camera software.</p>

<p>Step 1: Once you have created your storyboard, open the app to go to the Cloud Stop Motion dashboard. Click on the new project button. Cloud Stop Motion needs access to your camera for capturing images. So, allow camera access.</p>

                      alt="allowing access to camera on cloud stop motion"
                ></p>
<p>On the dashboard, go to the taking picture menu. Now place the subject at the center of your frame. Capture a few test shots to find the composition that you like. You can see the picture at the bottom of the timeline. If needed, adjust the position of your subject. Make sure that the location you choose has plenty of light. If not, you also use a lamp for good light.</p>
<p>Tip: Keeping your phone or camera steady while making your stop-motion project is the key. You can use a tripod, a selfie stick, or a gimbal to keep your device as still as possible. If you don’t own any of these, keep your device on something sturdy and make sure that you do not change its place until you capture all the images needed for your project. This way all your shots will be consistent.</p>
<p>Step 2: Move your subject or change its position and take a picture. Repeat the process until you complete your story. To make your stop-motion smooth, make small changes to the position of your subject between shots.</p>
<p><img

                      alt="capturing images on cloud stop motion"
                ></p>
<p>You can also add more frames per second. Generally, you should add 10 frames per second. But you can go for 25 frames per second to make a smoother video. All the pictures you snap are automatically added to the editor in chronological order.</p>
<p>Step 3: Once you have captured images for your project, add sound by going to the sound menu in the top left of the dashboard. You can record sounds, upload sounds, or select sounds from Cloud Stop Motion’s gallery. You can also add text to your Cloud Stop Motion project if you want.</p>
<p>Step 4: Click on play button to preview your project and see if your motion picture turned out as per your liking or not. If you do not like something, go back and make changes. Once done, download your video from cloudstop motion.</p>

<p>Step 1: Once you have created your storyboard, open the app to go to the Cloud Stop Motion dashboard. Click on the new project button. Cloud Stop Motion needs access to your camera for capturing images. So, allow camera access.</p>

                      alt="allowing access to camera on cloud stop motion"
                ></p>
<p>On the dashboard, go to the taking picture menu. Now place the subject at the center of your frame. Capture a few test shots to find the composition that you like. You can see the picture at the bottom of the timeline. If needed, adjust the position of your subject. Make sure that the location you choose has plenty of light. If not, you also use a lamp for good light.</p>
<p>Tip: Keeping your phone or camera steady while making your stop-motion project is the key. You can use a tripod, a selfie stick, or a gimbal to keep your device as still as possible. If you don’t own any of these, keep your device on something sturdy and make sure that you do not change its place until you capture all the images needed for your project. This way all your shots will be consistent.</p>
<p>Step 2: Move your subject or change its position and take a picture. Repeat the process until you complete your story. To make your stop-motion smooth, make small changes to the position of your subject between shots.</p>

                      alt="capturing images on cloud stop motion"
                ></p>
<p>You can also add more frames per second. Generally, you should add 10 frames per second. But you can go for 25 frames per second to make a smoother video. All the pictures you snap are automatically added to the editor in chronological order.</p>
<p>Step 3: Once you have captured images for your project, add sound by going to the sound menu in the top left of the dashboard. You can record sounds, upload sounds, or select sounds from Cloud Stop Motion’s gallery. You can also add text to your Cloud Stop Motion project if you want.</p>
<p>Step 4: Click on play button to preview your project and see if your motion picture turned out as per your liking or not. If you do not like something, go back and make changes. Once done, download your video from cloudstop motion.</p>

The values mentioned in the aspect ratio are not the actual value but refer to the relation of the width and height. Aspect ratio is expressed in terms of X: Y where X refers to the width while Y refers to the height of the video. Several aspect ratio standards are used in the present times like 16:9, 4:3, 3:2, 1.85:1, and more.</p>
<p>An aspect ratio defines the resolution of the display and thus for proper video playback that fits in within the screen size, the right aspect ratio has to be selected. Aspect ratio plays an important role in video resizing. To ensure that the videos do not look distorted while resizing, its aspect ratio has to be maintained.</p>

Moreover, platforms like YouTube, IGTV, Twitter, Facebook, and others have their recommendations for aspect ratio and to play your videos on these platforms, you need to match these requirements.</p>
<p>Additionally, when you want to resize a video or an image without making it appear distorted, you need to maintain its aspect ratio. So, to <strong>change ratio of photo</strong> and videos, right tools have to be used.</p>
