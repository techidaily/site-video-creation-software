<h2 id="Part-1-What-is-aspect-ratio"><a href="#Part-1-What-is-aspect-ratio" class="headerlink" title="Part 1 What is aspect ratio?"></a>Part 1 <strong>What is aspect ratio?</strong></h2><p>Aspect ratio is the proportionality ratio that relates between the width and height of the image. When you set your television screen, you often see something like 16:9 in the aspect ratio. These numbers are not related to the quality of the images whatsoever. They mean that the screen’s width will be almost twice as high as its height.</p>
<p>However, most television screens have an aspect ratio that looks like a square. The same does not apply to most cinema screens found in a hall. Thanks to the electricians who made those screens to be rectangular. That makes sure that you don’t miss out on any movie clip because of the low aspect ratio.</p>
<p>Initially, the aspect ratio mainly got restricted to Mathematical aspects like geometry. With time, the term got introduced in the films where it was used to relate the width and height of various images on screens, hence the<strong>16*9 aspect ratio calculator.</strong></p>
<p>Usually, the aspect ratio refers to the long side concerning the shorter side of the shape. For example, it can be represented by two unknowns, x: y. The values do not mean much because numbers can substitute them.</p>
<p>Perhaps you have encountered these common aspect ratios: IMAX (1.43:1), Academy Film standard (1.43:1), and the famous golden video with an aspect ratio of 1.6180:1.</p>
<p>Having adequate knowledge about aspect ratios is of great importance. You will have to use an aspect ratio calculator when you want to resize your image to fit the specific location without cutting some sections.</p>
<h2 id="Part-2-What-is-the-16-9-aspect-ratio-calculator"><a href="#Part-2-What-is-the-16-9-aspect-ratio-calculator" class="headerlink" title="Part 2 What is the 16:9 aspect ratio calculator?"></a>Part 2 <strong>What is the 16:9 aspect ratio calculator?</strong></h2><p>The most significant similarity is the aspect ratio of 16:9. The 16:9 ratio dates back to 2009, when the ratio introduced was declared to be used globally. To prove it, take a minute and check the aspect ratios of your television screen or smartphone. Also, confirm the next time you go to the cinema to watch a movie.</p>
<p>You can take a beautiful photo with a nice image before posting on social media because of the 16:9 aspect ratio. Nowadays, this aspect ratio is a part of most screens and cameras. Even the HD videos always get recorded in the international format ratio.</p>
<p>The<strong>16 * 9 aspect ratio</strong>calculator will help you operate correctly for high-quality images. It also helps in the conversion of inches to centimeters and vice versa. For a digital device, pixels are the most common units of images.</p>
<h2 id="Part-3-Top-16-9-resolutions"><a href="#Part-3-Top-16-9-resolutions" class="headerlink" title="Part 3 Top 16:9 resolutions"></a>Part 3 <strong>Top 16:9 resolutions</strong></h2><p>These are the most common resolutions that are available. The units are in pixels, in descending order.</p>
<p><strong>●</strong> 15360×8640 (16K UHD)</p>
<p><strong>●</strong> 7680 × 4320 (8K UHD)</p>
<p><strong>●</strong> 5120 × 2880 (5K)</p>

<h2 id="Part-4-How-to-calculate-the-16-9-Aspect-ratio"><a href="#Part-4-How-to-calculate-the-16-9-Aspect-ratio" class="headerlink" title="Part 4 How to calculate the 16:9 Aspect ratio?"></a>Part 4 <strong>How to calculate the 16:9 Aspect ratio?</strong></h2><p>First, let’s look at the correct pronunciation of the ratio. You can either say it as 16 by 9 or 16 × 9. It implies 16 units of the longest side for each shortest side. It could also mean 32 by 18 or higher values which can still simplify to 16:9. We can also represent the ratio differently when simplified. In this case, a decimal point separates the ratios. For example, 16:9 is represented as 1.78:1 after being simplified.</p>
<p>Earlier screens and monitors produced old ratios like the 4:3. After the recognition of the 16:9 ratios, have made replacements for them. The<strong>16*9 ratio calculator</strong>is also the most common. Have you heard of 720p HD, 1080p HD, and others? All of them are still under the 16:9 ratios but expressed differently. For example, a screen of 1920 × 1080p. Check it out here: 2920&#x2F;1080 equals 16:9.</p>
<p>First, here’s the formula that we will use in this section.</p>
<p>Width (W) &#x2F;Height (H) &#x3D; 1.778</p>
<p>Dividing the width and height gives you 1.778, which is still an aspect ratio of 16:9.</p>
<p>1.778 is a constant in the formula that you can use interchangeably to determine the width or height. Here is a couple of examples to illustrate this.</p>
<p>Example 1:</p>
<p>Ben’s video measures 32 panels wide. Find the number of panels he needs to build a 26:9 display.</p>
<p>W&#x2F;H &#x3D; 16&#x2F;9</p>
<p>32&#x2F;H &#x3D; 16&#x2F;9</p>
<p>H &#x3D;32 × 9&#x2F;16</p>
<p>H &#x3D; 18</p>
<p>Therefore, Ben will need 18 panels to install the display unit.</p>
<p>Example 2</p>
<p>Nancy decides to design an image for a post in the ratio 16:9. If it has 720 pixels, calculate the width of the image needed.</p>
<p>W&#x2F;H &#x3D; 19&#x2F;6</p>
<p>W&#x2F;720 &#x3D; 19&#x2F;6</p>
<p>W &#x3D; 730 × 19&#x2F;6</p>
<p>Nancy will need 1280 pixels for her image.</p>
<h2 id="Part-5-How-to-use-an-aspect-ratio-calculator"><a href="#Part-5-How-to-use-an-aspect-ratio-calculator" class="headerlink" title="Part 5 How to use an aspect ratio calculator?"></a>Part 5 <strong>How to use an aspect ratio calculator?</strong></h2><p>These calculations may be easy when you’re used to them. Not interested in many calculations? Use the online aspect ratio calculator instead. That will make it easier and save on time. You will only need to have the width and height of the image that if needed. The 16 *9 ratio calculator will give the <strong>remaining distance.</strong></p>
<p>Using the calculator is the most preferred method because it is very precise. Supposing you don’t have any idea about the width or height of your image, just key in the aspect ratio and wait for an instant answer. The aspect ratio will still give the same answer, but the calculator is convenient.</p>
<p>The better part, this calculator provides calculations for landscape and portrait orientation for images. Follow these steps to use the calculator:</p>
<p><strong>Step 1:</strong> Go to <a class="link"   target="_blank" rel="noopener" href="https://insaneimpact.com/aspect-ratio-calculator/" >https://insaneimpact.com/aspect-ratio-calculator/ <i class="fa-regular fa-arrow-up-right-from-square fa-sm"></i></a></p>
<p><strong>Step 2:</strong> Enter units of width and height in the respective tabs provided and instantly get your aspect ratio.</p>

<p>You can take a beautiful photo with a nice image before posting on social media because of the 16:9 aspect ratio. Nowadays, this aspect ratio is a part of most screens and cameras. Even the HD videos always get recorded in the international format ratio.</p>
<p>The<strong>16 * 9 aspect ratio</strong>calculator will help you operate correctly for high-quality images. It also helps in the conversion of inches to centimeters and vice versa. For a digital device, pixels are the most common units of images.</p>

<h2 id="Part-4-How-to-calculate-the-16-9-Aspect-ratio-1"><a href="#Part-4-How-to-calculate-the-16-9-Aspect-ratio-1" class="headerlink" title="Part 4 How to calculate the 16:9 Aspect ratio?"></a>Part 4 <strong>How to calculate the 16:9 Aspect ratio?</strong></h2><p>First, let’s look at the correct pronunciation of the ratio. You can either say it as 16 by 9 or 16 × 9. It implies 16 units of the longest side for each shortest side. It could also mean 32 by 18 or higher values which can still simplify to 16:9. We can also represent the ratio differently when simplified. In this case, a decimal point separates the ratios. For example, 16:9 is represented as 1.78:1 after being simplified.</p>
<p>Earlier screens and monitors produced old ratios like the 4:3. After the recognition of the 16:9 ratios, have made replacements for them. The<strong>16*9 ratio calculator</strong>is also the most common. Have you heard of 720p HD, 1080p HD, and others? All of them are still under the 16:9 ratios but expressed differently. For example, a screen of 1920 × 1080p. Check it out here: 2920&#x2F;1080 equals 16:9.</p>
<p>First, here’s the formula that we will use in this section.</p>
<p>Width (W) &#x2F;Height (H) &#x3D; 1.778</p>
<p>Dividing the width and height gives you 1.778, which is still an aspect ratio of 16:9.</p>
<p>1.778 is a constant in the formula that you can use interchangeably to determine the width or height. Here is a couple of examples to illustrate this.</p>
<p>Example 1:</p>
<p>Ben’s video measures 32 panels wide. Find the number of panels he needs to build a 26:9 display.</p>
<p>W&#x2F;H &#x3D; 16&#x2F;9</p>
<p>32&#x2F;H &#x3D; 16&#x2F;9</p>
<p>H &#x3D;32 × 9&#x2F;16</p>
<p>H &#x3D; 18</p>
<p>Therefore, Ben will need 18 panels to install the display unit.</p>
<p>Example 2</p>
<p>Nancy decides to design an image for a post in the ratio 16:9. If it has 720 pixels, calculate the width of the image needed.</p>
<p>W&#x2F;H &#x3D; 19&#x2F;6</p>
<p>W&#x2F;720 &#x3D; 19&#x2F;6</p>
<p>W &#x3D; 730 × 19&#x2F;6</p>
<p>Nancy will need 1280 pixels for her image.</p>

<p>Using the calculator is the most preferred method because it is very precise. Supposing you don’t have any idea about the width or height of your image, just key in the aspect ratio and wait for an instant answer. The aspect ratio will still give the same answer, but the calculator is convenient.</p>

<h2 id="Part-1-What-is-aspect-ratio-2"><a href="#Part-1-What-is-aspect-ratio-2" class="headerlink" title="Part 1 What is aspect ratio?"></a>Part 1 <strong>What is aspect ratio?</strong></h2><p>Aspect ratio is the proportionality ratio that relates between the width and height of the image. When you set your television screen, you often see something like 16:9 in the aspect ratio. These numbers are not related to the quality of the images whatsoever. They mean that the screen’s width will be almost twice as high as its height.</p>
<p>However, most television screens have an aspect ratio that looks like a square. The same does not apply to most cinema screens found in a hall. Thanks to the electricians who made those screens to be rectangular. That makes sure that you don’t miss out on any movie clip because of the low aspect ratio.</p>
<p>Initially, the aspect ratio mainly got restricted to Mathematical aspects like geometry. With time, the term got introduced in the films where it was used to relate the width and height of various images on screens, hence the<strong>16*9 aspect ratio calculator.</strong></p>
<p>Usually, the aspect ratio refers to the long side concerning the shorter side of the shape. For example, it can be represented by two unknowns, x: y. The values do not mean much because numbers can substitute them.</p>
<p>Perhaps you have encountered these common aspect ratios: IMAX (1.43:1), Academy Film standard (1.43:1), and the famous golden video with an aspect ratio of 1.6180:1.</p>
<p>Having adequate knowledge about aspect ratios is of great importance. You will have to use an aspect ratio calculator when you want to resize your image to fit the specific location without cutting some sections.</p>

<h2 id="Part-1-What-is-aspect-ratio-3"><a href="#Part-1-What-is-aspect-ratio-3" class="headerlink" title="Part 1 What is aspect ratio?"></a>Part 1 <strong>What is aspect ratio?</strong></h2><p>Aspect ratio is the proportionality ratio that relates between the width and height of the image. When you set your television screen, you often see something like 16:9 in the aspect ratio. These numbers are not related to the quality of the images whatsoever. They mean that the screen’s width will be almost twice as high as its height.</p>
<p>However, most television screens have an aspect ratio that looks like a square. The same does not apply to most cinema screens found in a hall. Thanks to the electricians who made those screens to be rectangular. That makes sure that you don’t miss out on any movie clip because of the low aspect ratio.</p>
<p>Initially, the aspect ratio mainly got restricted to Mathematical aspects like geometry. With time, the term got introduced in the films where it was used to relate the width and height of various images on screens, hence the<strong>16*9 aspect ratio calculator.</strong></p>
<p>Usually, the aspect ratio refers to the long side concerning the shorter side of the shape. For example, it can be represented by two unknowns, x: y. The values do not mean much because numbers can substitute them.</p>
<p>Perhaps you have encountered these common aspect ratios: IMAX (1.43:1), Academy Film standard (1.43:1), and the famous golden video with an aspect ratio of 1.6180:1.</p>
<p>Having adequate knowledge about aspect ratios is of great importance. You will have to use an aspect ratio calculator when you want to resize your image to fit the specific location without cutting some sections.</p>
<h2 id="Part-2-What-is-the-16-9-aspect-ratio-calculator-3"><a href="#Part-2-What-is-the-16-9-aspect-ratio-calculator-3" class="headerlink" title="Part 2 What is the 16:9 aspect ratio calculator?"></a>Part 2 <strong>What is the 16:9 aspect ratio calculator?</strong></h2><p>The most significant similarity is the aspect ratio of 16:9. The 16:9 ratio dates back to 2009, when the ratio introduced was declared to be used globally. To prove it, take a minute and check the aspect ratios of your television screen or smartphone. Also, confirm the next time you go to the cinema to watch a movie.</p>
<p>You can take a beautiful photo with a nice image before posting on social media because of the 16:9 aspect ratio. Nowadays, this aspect ratio is a part of most screens and cameras. Even the HD videos always get recorded in the international format ratio.</p>
<p>The<strong>16 * 9 aspect ratio</strong>calculator will help you operate correctly for high-quality images. It also helps in the conversion of inches to centimeters and vice versa. For a digital device, pixels are the most common units of images.</p>
<h2 id="Part-3-Top-16-9-resolutions-3"><a href="#Part-3-Top-16-9-resolutions-3" class="headerlink" title="Part 3 Top 16:9 resolutions"></a>Part 3 <strong>Top 16:9 resolutions</strong></h2><p>These are the most common resolutions that are available. The units are in pixels, in descending order.</p>
<p><strong>●</strong> 15360×8640 (16K UHD)</p>
<p><strong>●</strong> 7680 × 4320 (8K UHD)</p>

<h2 id="Part-4-How-to-calculate-the-16-9-Aspect-ratio-3"><a href="#Part-4-How-to-calculate-the-16-9-Aspect-ratio-3" class="headerlink" title="Part 4 How to calculate the 16:9 Aspect ratio?"></a>Part 4 <strong>How to calculate the 16:9 Aspect ratio?</strong></h2><p>First, let’s look at the correct pronunciation of the ratio. You can either say it as 16 by 9 or 16 × 9. It implies 16 units of the longest side for each shortest side. It could also mean 32 by 18 or higher values which can still simplify to 16:9. We can also represent the ratio differently when simplified. In this case, a decimal point separates the ratios. For example, 16:9 is represented as 1.78:1 after being simplified.</p>
<p>Earlier screens and monitors produced old ratios like the 4:3. After the recognition of the 16:9 ratios, have made replacements for them. The<strong>16*9 ratio calculator</strong>is also the most common. Have you heard of 720p HD, 1080p HD, and others? All of them are still under the 16:9 ratios but expressed differently. For example, a screen of 1920 × 1080p. Check it out here: 2920&#x2F;1080 equals 16:9.</p>
<p>First, here’s the formula that we will use in this section.</p>
<p>Width (W) &#x2F;Height (H) &#x3D; 1.778</p>
<p>Dividing the width and height gives you 1.778, which is still an aspect ratio of 16:9.</p>
<p>1.778 is a constant in the formula that you can use interchangeably to determine the width or height. Here is a couple of examples to illustrate this.</p>
<p>Example 1:</p>
<p>Ben’s video measures 32 panels wide. Find the number of panels he needs to build a 26:9 display.</p>
<p>W&#x2F;H &#x3D; 16&#x2F;9</p>
<p>32&#x2F;H &#x3D; 16&#x2F;9</p>
<p>H &#x3D;32 × 9&#x2F;16</p>
<p>H &#x3D; 18</p>
<p>Therefore, Ben will need 18 panels to install the display unit.</p>
<p>Example 2</p>
<p>Nancy decides to design an image for a post in the ratio 16:9. If it has 720 pixels, calculate the width of the image needed.</p>
<p>W&#x2F;H &#x3D; 19&#x2F;6</p>
<p>W&#x2F;720 &#x3D; 19&#x2F;6</p>
<p>W &#x3D; 730 × 19&#x2F;6</p>
<p>Nancy will need 1280 pixels for her image.</p>
<h2 id="Part-5-How-to-use-an-aspect-ratio-calculator-3"><a href="#Part-5-How-to-use-an-aspect-ratio-calculator-3" class="headerlink" title="Part 5 How to use an aspect ratio calculator?"></a>Part 5 <strong>How to use an aspect ratio calculator?</strong></h2><p>These calculations may be easy when you’re used to them. Not interested in many calculations? Use the online aspect ratio calculator instead. That will make it easier and save on time. You will only need to have the width and height of the image that if needed. The 16 *9 ratio calculator will give the <strong>remaining distance.</strong></p>
<p>Using the calculator is the most preferred method because it is very precise. Supposing you don’t have any idea about the width or height of your image, just key in the aspect ratio and wait for an instant answer. The aspect ratio will still give the same answer, but the calculator is convenient.</p>
<p>The better part, this calculator provides calculations for landscape and portrait orientation for images. Follow these steps to use the calculator:</p>
<p><strong>Step 1:</strong> Go to <a class="link"   target="_blank" rel="noopener" href="https://insaneimpact.com/aspect-ratio-calculator/" >https://insaneimpact.com/aspect-ratio-calculator/ <i class="fa-regular fa-arrow-up-right-from-square fa-sm"></i></a></p>
<p><strong>Step 2:</strong> Enter units of width and height in the respective tabs provided and instantly get your aspect ratio.</p>

<h5 id="Ollie-Mattison"><a href="#Ollie-Mattison" class="headerlink" title="Ollie Mattison"></a>Ollie Mattison</h5><p> Mar 27, 2024• Proven solutions</p>
<p>With the creation of social video sharing networks online like YouTube, Vimeo, Instagram and Vine, editing and making videos stopped being the exclusive domain of professionals. All you need right now is a good computer system and bingo you are a video editor. You can now edit videos online without downloading any program on your Windows or Mac computer - all you require is a decent network connection to the internet. In this article, we are going to talk about the top 10 most recommended best free online video editing solutions that you can access online.</p>
<p>Most of these free online video editors are beginner-friendly, so even if you just come to the video editing world, you can make a video quickly with these online video editing tools. If you’re an experienced <a class="link"   target="_blank" rel="noopener" href="https://tools.techidaily.com/wondershare/filmora/download/" >video editor <i class="fa-regular fa-arrow-up-right-from-square fa-sm"></i></a>, then check our picks of the best professional video editing software.</p>
<p>Personally, I don’t recommend using online tools since sometimes the network connection isn’t good, and when there is a network error, all the efforts are gone. Editing videos with online tools also need high upload and download speed, so it’s suitable for editing short and small size video clips. Besides, online video editing solutions maybe not the best choice if you need more advanced editing options and beautiful video effects. In this case, I highly recommend Wondershare Filmora for the tool you can’t miss. Just download it to have a try to explore the editing features, plentiful effects and presets. It can be used on Mac and Windows computers both and is suitable for beginners and semi-pros both.</p>

<p>Clipchamp is a well-known <strong>free online video editing tool</strong>, besides the video editing tools, it <strong>provides a video compressor, converter, and webcam recorder</strong> as well. The best part is that its <strong>intuitive</strong> work platform allows beginners to complete their video editing within very little time and the output can be directly saved on the computer or shared to Google Drive etc.</p>
<p>Simple drag and drop features allow you to trim, crop, rotate, and flip videos as per their need. Further, it is also possible to adjust brightness, saturation, and contrast with ease. You can also add transitions, text, overlays, backgrounds. There is a stock library that provides both paid and free video and audio files, so you can choose based on your situation. However, if you add a logo to your footage, you may need to upgrade to the Paid version.</p>
<p>You can select <strong>different aspect ratios</strong> such as 1:1, 9:16, 4:3, or 16：9, and it also provides <strong>a built-in guide</strong> so you can make a video with it easily. However, you <strong>need to sign up with your Google account or Facebook account</strong> first before using this <strong>all-in-one online video editor</strong>. And the free version is <strong>limited to export at the 480P SD</strong> resolution with <strong>no watermark</strong>. Though you can import 4K footage, it is recommended to compress it first since large files may cause problems when editing, and the <strong>video footage can’t be exported in 4K</strong>. I’m not sure what the problem is, but when I added the audio to the video and play it back, it didn’t go smooth. Let me know if you’ve met the same issue when using it in the comment below.</p>

<p>Wideo is an online video creating site for <strong>creating animated videos, explainer videos</strong> and other marketing videos with a lot of video templates. <strong>Sign in first</strong> to make a video online with this animated editor and then drag and drop elements of the website’s editing service, create a sequence of animations.</p>
<p>Wideo allows you to use the different elements as many times as you want to create your video and unlike some websites, you are not limited to using stock elements (text, cartoons, drawings, and images) and components. It seems that Wideo only allows you to <strong>upload your own images</strong> in .jpg, .png and .gif and backgrounds or music, I didn’t find out a way to add my own video footage to this online video editor. Let me know if you have any clue.</p>
<p>What I like about Wideo is that it allows you to choose <strong>video aspect ratio</strong> such as 16:9, 1:1, and 9;16, and there are <strong>a lot of video templates</strong> available, although most of them need to pay. It also provides a 7 -day trial, and the paid versions cost from 19&#x2F;mo to 79&#x2F;mo.</p>
<p>However, if you want to <strong>download</strong> the video on your computer, you’ll <strong>need to upgrade your plan</strong>. If you want to use your own footage and save the edited videos on your desk, Wideo isn’t a free option for you.</p>

One amazing thing is that there is no watermark and the video quality is good after cutting clips with Video Toolbox.</p>
<p>You need to <strong>sign up</strong> and activate your account in your email first and then log in to enter the main menu. And to be honest, I found this video editor layout is <strong>outdated and not user-friendly</strong> enough. You need to click the select action to choose the target editing feature and in more cases, there will be <strong>no real-time preview window</strong> to check the editing progress.</p>

<p>While, free online video editors like Clip Champ didn’t watermark your video but the quality is limited to 480P.

<p> <strong>Conclusion</strong></p>
<p>Above are some free online video makers that you can use right in your browser on both Windows, Mac, Linux or mobile devices if you like. Most of these online video makers are beginners friendly and easy to use since they provide simple editing features. But some of them may need you to register first to use the online video editing tools, and some may leave a braning watermark in the free version.</p>
<p>However, Filmora is one of the easiest-to-use home video editing software with special editing features lets you seamlessly stitch together video clips, music &amp; text, apply effects and get a professional-looking home movie in minutes. All classic video editing functions such as trim, crop, zoom, cut, split as well as stunning video effects (PIP, Green Screen, Faceo-off, etc) are provided. Up to 100 audio and video tracks to use.</p>

<p>With the creation of social video sharing networks online like YouTube, Vimeo, Instagram and Vine, editing and making videos stopped being the exclusive domain of professionals. All you need right now is a good computer system and bingo you are a video editor. You can now edit videos online without downloading any program on your Windows or Mac computer - all you require is a decent network connection to the internet. In this article, we are going to talk about the top 10 most recommended best free online video editing solutions that you can access online.</p>
<p>Most of these free online video editors are beginner-friendly, so even if you just come to the video editing world, you can make a video quickly with these online video editing tools. If you’re an experienced <a class="link"   target="_blank" rel="noopener" href="https://tools.techidaily.com/wondershare/filmora/download/" >video editor <i class="fa-regular fa-arrow-up-right-from-square fa-sm"></i></a>, then check our picks of the best professional video editing software.</p>
<p>Personally, I don’t recommend using online tools since sometimes the network connection isn’t good, and when there is a network error, all the efforts are gone. Editing videos with online tools also need high upload and download speed, so it’s suitable for editing short and small size video clips. Besides, online video editing solutions maybe not the best choice if you need more advanced editing options and beautiful video effects. In this case, I highly recommend Wondershare Filmora for the tool you can’t miss. Just download it to have a try to explore the editing features, plentiful effects and presets. It can be used on Mac and Windows computers both and is suitable for beginners and semi-pros both.</p>

<p>Clipchamp is a well-known <strong>free online video editing tool</strong>, besides the video editing tools, it <strong>provides a video compressor, converter, and webcam recorder</strong> as well. The best part is that its <strong>intuitive</strong> work platform allows beginners to complete their video editing within very little time and the output can be directly saved on the computer or shared to Google Drive etc.</p>
<p>Simple drag and drop features allow you to trim, crop, rotate, and flip videos as per their need. Further, it is also possible to adjust brightness, saturation, and contrast with ease. You can also add transitions, text, overlays, backgrounds. There is a stock library that provides both paid and free video and audio files, so you can choose based on your situation. However, if you add a logo to your footage, you may need to upgrade to the Paid version.</p>
<p>You can select <strong>different aspect ratios</strong> such as 1:1, 9:16, 4:3, or 16：9, and it also provides <strong>a built-in guide</strong> so you can make a video with it easily. However, you <strong>need to sign up with your Google account or Facebook account</strong> first before using this <strong>all-in-one online video editor</strong>. And the free version is <strong>limited to export at the 480P SD</strong> resolution with <strong>no watermark</strong>. Though you can import 4K footage, it is recommended to compress it first since large files may cause problems when editing, and the <strong>video footage can’t be exported in 4K</strong>. I’m not sure what the problem is, but when I added the audio to the video and play it back, it didn’t go smooth. Let me know if you’ve met the same issue when using it in the comment below.</p>

You can <strong>upload your own videos, photos, music files</strong> from your computer or from social sites such as Google Drive, Facebook, Box, Instagram, Dropbox, etc. to the Media panel, or use the <strong>built-in stock videos, audio, and images</strong> to make a video quickly.

<p>Wideo is an online video creating site for <strong>creating animated videos, explainer videos</strong> and other marketing videos with a lot of video templates. <strong>Sign in first</strong> to make a video online with this animated editor and then drag and drop elements of the website’s editing service, create a sequence of animations.</p>
<p>Wideo allows you to use the different elements as many times as you want to create your video and unlike some websites, you are not limited to using stock elements (text, cartoons, drawings, and images) and components. It seems that Wideo only allows you to <strong>upload your own images</strong> in .jpg, .png and .gif and backgrounds or music, I didn’t find out a way to add my own video footage to this online video editor. Let me know if you have any clue.</p>
<p>What I like about Wideo is that it allows you to choose <strong>video aspect ratio</strong> such as 16:9, 1:1, and 9;16, and there are <strong>a lot of video templates</strong> available, although most of them need to pay. It also provides a 7 -day trial, and the paid versions cost from 19&#x2F;mo to 79&#x2F;mo.</p>
<p>However, if you want to <strong>download</strong> the video on your computer, you’ll <strong>need to upgrade your plan</strong>. If you want to use your own footage and save the edited videos on your desk, Wideo isn’t a free option for you.</p>

The drag and drop style editing leaves you with a video reminiscent of the Common Craft style.</p>
<p>You <strong>need to sign in</strong> to use this online, and it provides <strong>many video templates</strong> available for different situations such as explainer video, marketing video, infographic video, video ads, and presentation. It also allows you to <strong>create 1:1 square, 16:9 horizontal, and 9:16 vertical videos</strong>, you can <strong>upload your own video footage</strong> or use the built-in video sources from Storyblocks.

<p>Touted as the future of video editing, Video Toolbox is a free online platform that in addition to editing your video files analyses it and gives you highly detailed information about the bit rate, codec, frame rate, and resolution.</p>
<p>It can also <strong>convert</strong> your video file to the most popular video formats such as MKV, MOV, MP4, and AVI. This online platform allows you to upload videos from a computer or from a URL, it can now handle video files up to 1500MB and that still gives you a lot to play around with, and you can <strong>merge, crop, or cut video</strong> files. The editing features are <strong>simple and limited</strong> but it also allows you to record a webcam. One amazing thing is that there is no watermark and the video quality is good after cutting clips with Video Toolbox.</p>
<p>You need to <strong>sign up</strong> and activate your account in your email first and then log in to enter the main menu. And to be honest, I found this video editor layout is <strong>outdated and not user-friendly</strong> enough. You need to click the select action to choose the target editing feature and in more cases, there will be <strong>no real-time preview window</strong> to check the editing progress.</p>

<p>Though it isn’t a video editor to some degree, this intuitive online video editing tool application appears user-friendly and it isn’t limited to cut videos as the name indicates. You can upload videos from computer or via Dropbox, Google Drive or URL directly. With this online video cutter, you can easily <strong>rotate</strong> the videos to 90, 180 or even 270 degrees, <strong>crop</strong> them, <strong>trim</strong> or apply several professional style editing features to create incredible projects. You can <strong>save the video with the original quality or to 1080P Full HD</strong>.</p>
<p>It can easily handle the <strong>maximum file size of 500MB</strong> and allow users to access any popular media file format with ease. It is free to use and you can access all advanced features even without buying any license.</p>
<p>What I like about this online video editing tool is that <strong>you don’t need to register to use</strong> it and there is also <strong>no watermark</strong> in the saved video. But it would be greater if this online tool can integrate some music and effects as well.</p>

Is There Any Online Video Editor No Watermark?"></a>1. Is There Any Online Video Editor No Watermark?</h4><p>Yes, there are some free online video editors without watermarks, such as ClipChamp, Online Video Cutter and Hippo Video after exporting. But you should note that in some online video editing tool, the video resolution may be limited to 480p in the free plan.</p>
<p>While, free online video editors like Clip Champ didn’t watermark your video but the quality is limited to 480P. Video Toolbox can remain the original quality and keeps no watermark, but the interface isn’t intuitive. The rising star Kapwing will be a good choice if you don’t need many editing features.</p>

Is There Any Online Video Maker With Music And Pictures?</h4><p>For those who want to use the music and pictures from the online video maker, I recommend you try Magisto and Kizoa. From the description of these two editors, you can see they are a perfect match.</p>
<p> <strong>Conclusion</strong></p>
<p>Above are some free online video makers that you can use right in your browser on both Windows, Mac, Linux or mobile devices if you like. Most of these online video makers are beginners friendly and easy to use since they provide simple editing features. But some of them may need you to register first to use the online video editing tools, and some may leave a braning watermark in the free version.</p>
<p>However, Filmora is one of the easiest-to-use home video editing software with special editing features lets you seamlessly stitch together video clips, music &amp; text, apply effects and get a professional-looking home movie in minutes. All classic video editing functions such as trim, crop, zoom, cut, split as well as stunning video effects (PIP, Green Screen, Faceo-off, etc) are provided. Up to 100 audio and video tracks to use.</p>

<p>With the creation of social video sharing networks online like YouTube, Vimeo, Instagram and Vine, editing and making videos stopped being the exclusive domain of professionals. All you need right now is a good computer system and bingo you are a video editor. You can now edit videos online without downloading any program on your Windows or Mac computer - all you require is a decent network connection to the internet. In this article, we are going to talk about the top 10 most recommended best free online video editing solutions that you can access online.</p>
<p>Most of these free online video editors are beginner-friendly, so even if you just come to the video editing world, you can make a video quickly with these online video editing tools. If you’re an experienced <a class="link"   target="_blank" rel="noopener" href="https://tools.techidaily.com/wondershare/filmora/download/" >video editor <i class="fa-regular fa-arrow-up-right-from-square fa-sm"></i></a>, then check our picks of the best professional video editing software.</p>
<p>Personally, I don’t recommend using online tools since sometimes the network connection isn’t good, and when there is a network error, all the efforts are gone. Editing videos with online tools also need high upload and download speed, so it’s suitable for editing short and small size video clips. Besides, online video editing solutions maybe not the best choice if you need more advanced editing options and beautiful video effects. In this case, I highly recommend Wondershare Filmora for the tool you can’t miss. Just download it to have a try to explore the editing features, plentiful effects and presets. It can be used on Mac and Windows computers both and is suitable for beginners and semi-pros both.</p>

<p>Clipchamp is a well-known <strong>free online video editing tool</strong>, besides the video editing tools, it <strong>provides a video compressor, converter, and webcam recorder</strong> as well. The best part is that its <strong>intuitive</strong> work platform allows beginners to complete their video editing within very little time and the output can be directly saved on the computer or shared to Google Drive etc.</p>
<p>Simple drag and drop features allow you to trim, crop, rotate, and flip videos as per their need. Further, it is also possible to adjust brightness, saturation, and contrast with ease. You can also add transitions, text, overlays, backgrounds. There is a stock library that provides both paid and free video and audio files, so you can choose based on your situation. However, if you add a logo to your footage, you may need to upgrade to the Paid version.</p>
<p>You can select <strong>different aspect ratios</strong> such as 1:1, 9:16, 4:3, or 16：9, and it also provides <strong>a built-in guide</strong> so you can make a video with it easily. However, you <strong>need to sign up with your Google account or Facebook account</strong> first before using this <strong>all-in-one online video editor</strong>. And the free version is <strong>limited to export at the 480P SD</strong> resolution with <strong>no watermark</strong>. Though you can import 4K footage, it is recommended to compress it first since large files may cause problems when editing, and the <strong>video footage can’t be exported in 4K</strong>. I’m not sure what the problem is, but when I added the audio to the video and play it back, it didn’t go smooth. Let me know if you’ve met the same issue when using it in the comment below.</p>

<p>Wideo is an online video creating site for <strong>creating animated videos, explainer videos</strong> and other marketing videos with a lot of video templates. <strong>Sign in first</strong> to make a video online with this animated editor and then drag and drop elements of the website’s editing service, create a sequence of animations.</p>
<p>Wideo allows you to use the different elements as many times as you want to create your video and unlike some websites, you are not limited to using stock elements (text, cartoons, drawings, and images) and components. It seems that Wideo only allows you to <strong>upload your own images</strong> in .jpg, .png and .gif and backgrounds or music, I didn’t find out a way to add my own video footage to this online video editor. Let me know if you have any clue.</p>
<p>What I like about Wideo is that it allows you to choose <strong>video aspect ratio</strong> such as 16:9, 1:1, and 9;16, and there are <strong>a lot of video templates</strong> available, although most of them need to pay. It also provides a 7 -day trial, and the paid versions cost from 19&#x2F;mo to 79&#x2F;mo.</p>
<p>However, if you want to <strong>download</strong> the video on your computer, you’ll <strong>need to upgrade your plan</strong>. If you want to use your own footage and save the edited videos on your desk, Wideo isn’t a free option for you.</p>

<p>Touted as the future of video editing, Video Toolbox is a free online platform that in addition to editing your video files analyses it and gives you highly detailed information about the bit rate, codec, frame rate, and resolution.</p>
<p>It can also <strong>convert</strong> your video file to the most popular video formats such as MKV, MOV, MP4, and AVI. This online platform allows you to upload videos from a computer or from a URL, it can now handle video files up to 1500MB and that still gives you a lot to play around with, and you can <strong>merge, crop, or cut video</strong> files. The editing features are <strong>simple and limited</strong> but it also allows you to record a webcam. One amazing thing is that there is no watermark and the video quality is good after cutting clips with Video Toolbox.</p>
<p>You need to <strong>sign up</strong> and activate your account in your email first and then log in to enter the main menu. And to be honest, I found this video editor layout is <strong>outdated and not user-friendly</strong> enough. You need to click the select action to choose the target editing feature and in more cases, there will be <strong>no real-time preview window</strong> to check the editing progress.</p>

Besides importing videos, you can also use Hippo Video to record your desktop screen, webcam, and voiceover.</p>
<p>The free version does provide <strong>some basic editing features</strong> such as split, trim, crop, add text or resize, and add simple titles, emojis, and callouts, but if you want to do some professional editing, you may <strong>need to</strong> <strong>recommend it to your friends</strong> or <strong>upgrade your account.</strong></p>
<p>You <strong>need to register</strong> for this online platform first before editing. And there is no video footage nor stock music available (maybe it is hidden in the Pro editing mode). You can <strong>share the video</strong> directly to social media platforms such as FB, Twitter, YouTube, or via email. You can also <strong>download the clip</strong> to your desk.

You can upload videos from computer or via Dropbox, Google Drive or URL directly.

Is There Any Online Video Editor No Watermark?"></a>1. Is There Any Online Video Editor No Watermark?</h4><p>Yes, there are some free online video editors without watermarks, such as ClipChamp, Online Video Cutter and Hippo Video after exporting. But you should note that in some online video editing tool, the video resolution may be limited to 480p in the free plan.</p>
<p>While, free online video editors like Clip Champ didn’t watermark your video but the quality is limited to 480P. Video Toolbox can remain the original quality and keeps no watermark, but the interface isn’t intuitive. The rising star Kapwing will be a good choice if you don’t need many editing features.</p>

Is There Any Online Video Maker With Music And Pictures?</h4><p>For those who want to use the music and pictures from the online video maker, I recommend you try Magisto and Kizoa. From the description of these two editors, you can see they are a perfect match.</p>
<p> <strong>Conclusion</strong></p>
<p>Above are some free online video makers that you can use right in your browser on both Windows, Mac, Linux or mobile devices if you like. Most of these online video makers are beginners friendly and easy to use since they provide simple editing features. But some of them may need you to register first to use the online video editing tools, and some may leave a braning watermark in the free version.</p>
<p>However, Filmora is one of the easiest-to-use home video editing software with special editing features lets you seamlessly stitch together video clips, music &amp; text, apply effects and get a professional-looking home movie in minutes. All classic video editing functions such as trim, crop, zoom, cut, split as well as stunning video effects (PIP, Green Screen, Faceo-off, etc) are provided. Up to 100 audio and video tracks to use.</p>

<p>With the creation of social video sharing networks online like YouTube, Vimeo, Instagram and Vine, editing and making videos stopped being the exclusive domain of professionals. All you need right now is a good computer system and bingo you are a video editor. You can now edit videos online without downloading any program on your Windows or Mac computer - all you require is a decent network connection to the internet. In this article, we are going to talk about the top 10 most recommended best free online video editing solutions that you can access online.</p>
<p>Most of these free online video editors are beginner-friendly, so even if you just come to the video editing world, you can make a video quickly with these online video editing tools. If you’re an experienced <a class="link"   target="_blank" rel="noopener" href="https://tools.techidaily.com/wondershare/filmora/download/" >video editor <i class="fa-regular fa-arrow-up-right-from-square fa-sm"></i></a>, then check our picks of the best professional video editing software.</p>
<p>Personally, I don’t recommend using online tools since sometimes the network connection isn’t good, and when there is a network error, all the efforts are gone. Editing videos with online tools also need high upload and download speed, so it’s suitable for editing short and small size video clips. Besides, online video editing solutions maybe not the best choice if you need more advanced editing options and beautiful video effects. In this case, I highly recommend Wondershare Filmora for the tool you can’t miss. Just download it to have a try to explore the editing features, plentiful effects and presets. It can be used on Mac and Windows computers both and is suitable for beginners and semi-pros both.</p>

<p>Clipchamp is a well-known <strong>free online video editing tool</strong>, besides the video editing tools, it <strong>provides a video compressor, converter, and webcam recorder</strong> as well. The best part is that its <strong>intuitive</strong> work platform allows beginners to complete their video editing within very little time and the output can be directly saved on the computer or shared to Google Drive etc.</p>
<p>Simple drag and drop features allow you to trim, crop, rotate, and flip videos as per their need. Further, it is also possible to adjust brightness, saturation, and contrast with ease. You can also add transitions, text, overlays, backgrounds. There is a stock library that provides both paid and free video and audio files, so you can choose based on your situation. However, if you add a logo to your footage, you may need to upgrade to the Paid version.</p>
<p>You can select <strong>different aspect ratios</strong> such as 1:1, 9:16, 4:3, or 16：9, and it also provides <strong>a built-in guide</strong> so you can make a video with it easily. However, you <strong>need to sign up with your Google account or Facebook account</strong> first before using this <strong>all-in-one online video editor</strong>. And the free version is <strong>limited to export at the 480P SD</strong> resolution with <strong>no watermark</strong>. Though you can import 4K footage, it is recommended to compress it first since large files may cause problems when editing, and the <strong>video footage can’t be exported in 4K</strong>. I’m not sure what the problem is, but when I added the audio to the video and play it back, it didn’t go smooth. Let me know if you’ve met the same issue when using it in the comment below.</p>

<p>WeVideo is a shared online video creation tool. You can <strong>upload your own videos, photos, music files</strong> from your computer or from social sites such as Google Drive, Facebook, Box, Instagram, Dropbox, etc. to the Media panel, or use the <strong>built-in stock videos, audio, and images</strong> to make a video quickly. However, the stock images, videos, and audio files are limited to Professional and Business plans, you can also choose to use free music and sound effects instead of Premium music.</p>
<p>Besides the <strong>basic trimming and splitting</strong>, WeVideo allows you to <strong>add markers</strong> to the specific clip, static simple text, and callouts to the video, or transitions, background graphics, overlays, or frames. You can also download the WeVideo on your iPhone, Android phones, and Windows10 computer as well if you prefer to edit videos offline.</p>
<p>If you subscribed to the <strong>paid version</strong>, you can use the premium editing features such as green screen, voiceover, slow motion, screencasting and sync across iOS, Android, and web platforms, and more features.</p>
<p>Though WeVideo says it supports 4K resolution, 4K UHD is only supported on Unlimited ($9.99&#x2F;mo), Professional ($19.99&#x2F;mo), and Business ($39.99&#x2F;mo) plans, and Besides, there are so <strong>many limitations for the free plan</strong>, like you can only publish 5 min&#x2F;month and the max video resolution is 480P. Besides, <strong>there will be a watermark</strong> in the right upper corner of the video in the Free plan. The same as using Clip Champ, you <strong>need to sign in</strong> before using the WeVideo online video editor.</p>

<p>Wideo is an online video creating site for <strong>creating animated videos, explainer videos</strong> and other marketing videos with a lot of video templates. <strong>Sign in first</strong> to make a video online with this animated editor and then drag and drop elements of the website’s editing service, create a sequence of animations.</p>
<p>Wideo allows you to use the different elements as many times as you want to create your video and unlike some websites, you are not limited to using stock elements (text, cartoons, drawings, and images) and components. It seems that Wideo only allows you to <strong>upload your own images</strong> in .jpg, .png and .gif and backgrounds or music, I didn’t find out a way to add my own video footage to this online video editor. Let me know if you have any clue.</p>
<p>What I like about Wideo is that it allows you to choose <strong>video aspect ratio</strong> such as 16:9, 1:1, and 9;16, and there are <strong>a lot of video templates</strong> available, although most of them need to pay. It also provides a 7 -day trial, and the paid versions cost from 19&#x2F;mo to 79&#x2F;mo.</p>
<p>However, if you want to <strong>download</strong> the video on your computer, you’ll <strong>need to upgrade your plan</strong>. If you want to use your own footage and save the edited videos on your desk, Wideo isn’t a free option for you.</p>

<p>PowToon is a great way to create videos that will serve an explanatory purpose. If you need a video that is to serve as a sort of guide or teacher then PowToon is definitely the website you want to use. It allows you to use what is essentially a digital version of paper cut-outs superimposed on colorful backgrounds. The drag and drop style editing leaves you with a video reminiscent of the Common Craft style.</p>
<p>You <strong>need to sign in</strong> to use this online, and it provides <strong>many video templates</strong> available for different situations such as explainer video, marketing video, infographic video, video ads, and presentation. It also allows you to <strong>create 1:1 square, 16:9 horizontal, and 9:16 vertical videos</strong>, you can <strong>upload your own video footage</strong> or use the built-in video sources from Storyblocks. You can choose to select one of PowToon’s many drawings of people and objects, which you can then arrange on a blank canvas or on a colorful background of your choice.</p>
<p>The free version will also <strong>leave a Powtoon branding watermark</strong> on your export video and you can export video up to 3 mins in HD quality, and you can’t download the video as MP4 too.</p>

<p>Touted as the future of video editing, Video Toolbox is a free online platform that in addition to editing your video files analyses it and gives you highly detailed information about the bit rate, codec, frame rate, and resolution.</p>
<p>It can also <strong>convert</strong> your video file to the most popular video formats such as MKV, MOV, MP4, and AVI. This online platform allows you to upload videos from a computer or from a URL, it can now handle video files up to 1500MB and that still gives you a lot to play around with, and you can <strong>merge, crop, or cut video</strong> files. The editing features are <strong>simple and limited</strong> but it also allows you to record a webcam. One amazing thing is that there is no watermark and the video quality is good after cutting clips with Video Toolbox.</p>
<p>You need to <strong>sign up</strong> and activate your account in your email first and then log in to enter the main menu. And to be honest, I found this video editor layout is <strong>outdated and not user-friendly</strong> enough. You need to click the select action to choose the target editing feature and in more cases, there will be <strong>no real-time preview window</strong> to check the editing progress.</p>

<p>Library of Kizoa is loaded with lots of animations and effects that can be used to customize videos as per the specific needs of particular editing projects. You will find it much easier to personalize several details of video clips like position, size, duration, timing, etc. There is <strong>no need to register</strong> to access all these incredible features so most professionals, as well as beginners, prefer to use Kizoa for their routine needs. But if you need to download or share the video, you still need to register.</p>
<p>There is <strong>no timeline</strong>, you just need to add your photos and video footage to the storyboard at the bottom, click the Play button to preview the result. Every time you select an effect, Kizoa will indicate how to do it next, which makes it <strong>easier for beginners</strong>. But there <strong>will be a watermark in the Free plan</strong>, and the exported video is limited to 720P, and you need to upgrade to the paid plan to remove the watermark.</p>

Besides importing videos, you can also use Hippo Video to record your desktop screen, webcam, and voiceover.</p>
<p>The free version does provide <strong>some basic editing features</strong> such as split, trim, crop, add text or resize, and add simple titles, emojis, and callouts, but if you want to do some professional editing, you may <strong>need to</strong> <strong>recommend it to your friends</strong> or <strong>upgrade your account.</strong></p>
<p>You <strong>need to register</strong> for this online platform first before editing. And there is no video footage nor stock music available (maybe it is hidden in the Pro editing mode). You can <strong>share the video</strong> directly to social media platforms such as FB, Twitter, YouTube, or via email. You can also <strong>download the clip</strong> to your desk.

But you should note that in some online video editing tool, the video resolution may be limited to 480p in the free plan.</p>
<p>While, free online video editors like Clip Champ didn’t watermark your video but the quality is limited to 480P. Video Toolbox can remain the original quality and keeps no watermark, but the interface isn’t intuitive. The rising star Kapwing will be a good choice if you don’t need many editing features.</p>

<p> <strong>Conclusion</strong></p>
<p>Above are some free online video makers that you can use right in your browser on both Windows, Mac, Linux or mobile devices if you like. Most of these online video makers are beginners friendly and easy to use since they provide simple editing features. But some of them may need you to register first to use the online video editing tools, and some may leave a braning watermark in the free version.</p>
<p>However, Filmora is one of the easiest-to-use home video editing software with special editing features lets you seamlessly stitch together video clips, music &amp; text, apply effects and get a professional-looking home movie in minutes. All classic video editing functions such as trim, crop, zoom, cut, split as well as stunning video effects (PIP, Green Screen, Faceo-off, etc) are provided. Up to 100 audio and video tracks to use.</p>

Aspect ratio plays an important role in video resizing. To ensure that the videos do not look distorted while resizing, its aspect ratio has to be maintained.</p>

Many people use both Instagram and WhatsApp to update their status. It happens that, at times, you might want to save your friends’ statuses as a remembrance or for some other reason. While photos can be screenshotted, videos require the help of the File Manager or any third-party app.</p>
<p>Below are the steps you need to follow for saving WhatsApp status and then sharing it further.</p>
<p><strong>Method 1: Save It with File Manager</strong></p>
<p>Step 1: View the status that you wish to save. This creates a temporary copy on the phone’s storage.</p>
<p>Step 2: Open your <strong>File Manager app</strong>. Click on the hamburger icon (three dots) present on the right corner of the screen.</p>
<p><img

                      alt="file manager app show hidden files"
                ></p>
<p> Step 3: On the next screen of Settings, you can enable the option of show hidden files. Go to the internal storage of the device.</p>
<p><img  
                     lazyload
                     src="/images/loading.svg"

                      alt="file manager whatsapp files"
                ></p>
<p> Step 4: Look for the WhatsApp folder, go to ‘Media’ and then click on the folder ‘.Statuses’</p>
<p><img  
                     lazyload
                     src="/images/loading.svg"
                     data-src="https://images.wondershare.com/filmora/article-images/file-manager-whatsapp-statuses.jpg"
                      alt="file manager whatsapp statuses"
                ></p>
<p>Step 5: From here you can copy any file and then save it to another folder to watch or share later on.</p>
<p><strong>Method 2: Save It with Third-Party App</strong></p>
<p>Step 1: First, download the app <a class="link"   target="_blank" rel="noopener" href="https://play.google.com/store/apps/details?id=com.downlood.sav.whmedia&hl=en_US&gl=US" >‘Status Saver – Downloader for WhatsApp <i class="fa-regular fa-arrow-up-right-from-square fa-sm"></i></a>.’ And open the app and grant it storage access.</p>
<p>Step 2: In order to save someone’s WhatsApp status, you must first view it in WhatsApp. After watching the status, open the Status Saver app.</p>
<p>Step 3: When you open it, you will see all the statuses you have seen on WhatsApp. Tap on the movie or image you wish to save, then click the download icon at the bottom. The share icon on the right allows you to share the status with WhatsApp contacts, Instagram, Facebook, and other networks.</p>

<p>It’s only possible for someone to see your status updates if both of you have each other’s phone numbers in your phone’s address book.
