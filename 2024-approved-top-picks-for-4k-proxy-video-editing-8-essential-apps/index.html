<p>Shooting videos in high resolutions can help you create visually impressive content your followers on social media are going to adore. The only trouble is that the size of 4K videos can slow you down during the video editing process if your computer doesn’t have enough RAM memory or processing power. Additionally, quite a few inexpensive or free video editing apps don’t allow their users to create low-resolution proxy files that make the process of editing 4K videos much faster. That’s why in this article we are going to take you through the best 8 video editors you can use for 4K proxy video editing.</p>
<h2 id="The-Best-Video-Editing-Apps-for-Proxy-Editing-in-2020"><a href="#The-Best-Video-Editing-Apps-for-Proxy-Editing-in-2020" class="headerlink" title="The Best Video Editing Apps for Proxy Editing in 2020"></a>The Best Video Editing Apps for Proxy Editing in 2020</h2><p>Some of the video editing apps we featured in this article can only run on computers that already have the advanced hardware setups. However, even if you have a computer setup that can easily support processing of the 4K video files, proxy editing can still be useful as it can reduce the amount of time you will have to spend on performing complex video editing tasks. Let’s take a look at some of the best video editors that support proxy editing.</p>
<h4 id="1-Filmora"><a href="#1-Filmora" class="headerlink" title="1.

<p>The wide range of video editing options, support for nearly all popular video file formats or quick and simple exporting process are only a few reasons why Filmora is one of the best video editors you can use this year. Creating proxy files in Filmora is not a difficult task, because the software generates them automatically for you. You just have to choose between the <strong>1280x720p or 1920x1080p resolutions</strong> and Filmora will create proxies for all media files that are larger than the resolution you’ve selected. However, the amount of time Filmora is going to need to create proxies depends on your computer’s processing power, but also on the size and the number of the RAW files you imported into a project.</p>

<p><strong>Compatibility:</strong> Windows, macOS</p>
<p>This is probably one of the best, if not the best non-linear video editing software ever created, so it is hardly surprising that you can easily create proxy files for all videos you use in a project you create in Adobe Premiere Pro. So, to create proxy files you just need to open the folder that contains those files from the <strong>Media Browser</strong> and then click on the <strong>Ingest button</strong>. You should then click on the <strong>wrench tool</strong> and pick the <strong>Create Proxies option</strong> from the drop-down menu located next to the <strong>Ingest option</strong>. Afterward, you should select one of the available resolution presets and proceed to import the footage into the project. However, before you can start editing with proxies you have to click on the <strong>Toggle Proxy button</strong>.</p>

<p><strong>Compatibility:</strong> macOS</p>
<p>Transcoding media with FCPX doesn’t require too much effort, as the software offers a couple of options that make the editing process faster. You can opt to <strong>generate optimized media files</strong> by transcoding the original video clips into <strong>Apple ProRes 422 codec</strong> format that shortens the amount of time needed for rendering and provides excellent quality of color that is required for compositing. The <strong>proxy media files</strong> will also be created by transcoding the videos to <strong>Apple ProRes 422 codec format</strong> that retains original aspect ratio and frame rate of the video clips you transcoded. It is also worth noting that FCPX transcodes <strong>all mp3 files</strong> you import into a project to <strong>MOV audio files</strong>.</p>

<p><strong>Compatibility:</strong> Windows</p>
<p>This video editor is often overlooked in conversations about the most powerful video editing apps, but the tools it offers are powerful enough to enable you to edit videos at a professional level. Creating proxy files in Vegas Pro is remarkably easy, as you just have to <strong>import the files</strong> into a new project, <strong>select each file</strong> you want to transcode and then choose the <strong>Create Video Proxy</strong> option from the right-click menu. Just keep in mind that you must create proxy files before you do any actual editing because otherwise, the transcoding process is not going work.</p>

<p><strong>Compatibility:</strong> Linux, macOS, Windows</p>
<p>Blender is a 3D modeling and VFX software that lets you track objects or use 3D painting tools among numerous other options. Even though creating proxies with this app is not a particularly complicated process, you still have to be familiar with Blender in order to make full use of its transcoding options. The software allows you to generate proxy files whose size is only <strong>25% of the video’s original size</strong>, although you can also create proxies that have <strong>50% and 75%</strong> of the video’s original size. After you’ve adjusted the transcoding settings you should simply click on the <strong>Rebuild Proxy and Timecode Indices</strong> button.</p>
<h4 id="6-Shotcut"><a href="#6-Shotcut" class="headerlink" title="6. Shotcut"></a>6. <a class="link"   target="_blank" rel="noopener" href="https://shotcut.org/" >Shotcut <i class="fa-regular fa-arrow-up-right-from-square fa-sm"></i></a></h4><p><strong>Price:</strong> Free</p>
<p><strong>Compatibility:</strong> Windows, macOS, Linux</p>
<p>Despite the fact that this cross-platform video editor <strong>supports 4K and ProRes files</strong> that can cause it to lag at times, creating proxies in Shotcut is a highly technical process. In case you decide to make a proxy file by yourself, you will have to <strong>export a version of the file that is two or four times smaller than the original</strong>. You must also remember that you have to go through the entire process of creating proxies before you make any edits. The trick to creating proxies in Shotcut is to <strong>make a project file with the larger version of the video, then replace the larger version of the file with a smaller version of that same video file</strong>, before you actually start editing. Once you’ve completed the editing process, you can then once again add the larger source file to the project and export your video in high resolution.</p>

<p><strong>Compatibility:</strong> Linux, macOS, Windows</p>
<p>The process of creating proxies in Lightworks is rather simple since you just have to import the video files you’d like to edit into the software and make sure they are selected before you right-click on them. Once the right-click menu appears on the screen you should click on the <strong>Media submenu</strong> and select the <strong>Make Proxies</strong> option. The amount of time Lightworks is going to need to generate the proxy files depends on the number of the source files and their size. You can then proceed to add the proxies to the timeline, edit them and Lightworks will automatically use the source files instead of proxies during the rendering process.</p>

<p><strong>Compatibility:</strong> macOS, Windows</p>
<p>Once you create a new project and import all video clips you want to use in that project into the editor you should just go to the <strong>Assets menu</strong> that is located in <strong>the Media panel</strong> and click on the <strong>Make Proxy option</strong>. You will be able to continue editing while the transcoding process is still in progress, and after the source files are transcoded they will be replaced by proxies. However, making adjustments to a proxy version of a composite shot will invalidate that proxy file, which is why it is important to make all edits on that shot before you create its proxy.</p>
<p><strong>Conclusion</strong></p>
<p>Reducing the size of video clips you use in your projects is going to save you a lot of time during the video editing process. Each video editing software we featured in this article allows its users to generate proxy files effortlessly. Which video editor are you going to be using for proxy video editing?

The only trouble is that the size of 4K videos can slow you down during the video editing process if your computer doesn’t have enough RAM memory or processing power. Additionally, quite a few inexpensive or free video editing apps don’t allow their users to create low-resolution proxy files that make the process of editing 4K videos much faster. That’s why in this article we are going to take you through the best 8 video editors you can use for 4K proxy video editing.</p>

<p>The wide range of video editing options, support for nearly all popular video file formats or quick and simple exporting process are only a few reasons why Filmora is one of the best video editors you can use this year. Creating proxy files in Filmora is not a difficult task, because the software generates them automatically for you. You just have to choose between the <strong>1280x720p or 1920x1080p resolutions</strong> and Filmora will create proxies for all media files that are larger than the resolution you’ve selected. However, the amount of time Filmora is going to need to create proxies depends on your computer’s processing power, but also on the size and the number of the RAW files you imported into a project.</p>

You can then proceed to add the proxies to the timeline, edit them and Lightworks will automatically use the source files instead of proxies during the rendering process.</p>

<p>Once you create a new project and import all video clips you want to use in that project into the editor you should just go to the <strong>Assets menu</strong> that is located in <strong>the Media panel</strong> and click on the <strong>Make Proxy option</strong>. You will be able to continue editing while the transcoding process is still in progress, and after the source files are transcoded they will be replaced by proxies. However, making adjustments to a proxy version of a composite shot will invalidate that proxy file, which is why it is important to make all edits on that shot before you create its proxy.</p>
<p><strong>Conclusion</strong></p>
<p>Reducing the size of video clips you use in your projects is going to save you a lot of time during the video editing process. Each video editing software we featured in this article allows its users to generate proxy files effortlessly. Which video editor are you going to be using for proxy video editing?

<p>Shooting videos in high resolutions can help you create visually impressive content your followers on social media are going to adore. The only trouble is that the size of 4K videos can slow you down during the video editing process if your computer doesn’t have enough RAM memory or processing power. Additionally, quite a few inexpensive or free video editing apps don’t allow their users to create low-resolution proxy files that make the process of editing 4K videos much faster. That’s why in this article we are going to take you through the best 8 video editors you can use for 4K proxy video editing.</p>

However, even if you have a computer setup that can easily support processing of the 4K video files, proxy editing can still be useful as it can reduce the amount of time you will have to spend on performing complex video editing tasks. Let’s take a look at some of the best video editors that support proxy editing.</p>
<h4 id="1-Filmora-3"><a href="#1-Filmora-3" class="headerlink" title="1.

<p>The wide range of video editing options, support for nearly all popular video file formats or quick and simple exporting process are only a few reasons why Filmora is one of the best video editors you can use this year. Creating proxy files in Filmora is not a difficult task, because the software generates them automatically for you. You just have to choose between the <strong>1280x720p or 1920x1080p resolutions</strong> and Filmora will create proxies for all media files that are larger than the resolution you’ve selected. However, the amount of time Filmora is going to need to create proxies depends on your computer’s processing power, but also on the size and the number of the RAW files you imported into a project.</p>
<h4 id="2-Adobe-Premiere-Pro-CC-3"><a href="#2-Adobe-Premiere-Pro-CC-3" class="headerlink" title="2.

<p><strong>Compatibility:</strong> Windows, macOS</p>
<p>This is probably one of the best, if not the best non-linear video editing software ever created, so it is hardly surprising that you can easily create proxy files for all videos you use in a project you create in Adobe Premiere Pro. So, to create proxy files you just need to open the folder that contains those files from the <strong>Media Browser</strong> and then click on the <strong>Ingest button</strong>. You should then click on the <strong>wrench tool</strong> and pick the <strong>Create Proxies option</strong> from the drop-down menu located next to the <strong>Ingest option</strong>. Afterward, you should select one of the available resolution presets and proceed to import the footage into the project. However, before you can start editing with proxies you have to click on the <strong>Toggle Proxy button</strong>.</p>

<p><strong>Compatibility:</strong> macOS</p>
<p>Transcoding media with FCPX doesn’t require too much effort, as the software offers a couple of options that make the editing process faster. You can opt to <strong>generate optimized media files</strong> by transcoding the original video clips into <strong>Apple ProRes 422 codec</strong> format that shortens the amount of time needed for rendering and provides excellent quality of color that is required for compositing. The <strong>proxy media files</strong> will also be created by transcoding the videos to <strong>Apple ProRes 422 codec format</strong> that retains original aspect ratio and frame rate of the video clips you transcoded. It is also worth noting that FCPX transcodes <strong>all mp3 files</strong> you import into a project to <strong>MOV audio files</strong>.</p>

<p><strong>Compatibility:</strong> Windows</p>
<p>This video editor is often overlooked in conversations about the most powerful video editing apps, but the tools it offers are powerful enough to enable you to edit videos at a professional level. Creating proxy files in Vegas Pro is remarkably easy, as you just have to <strong>import the files</strong> into a new project, <strong>select each file</strong> you want to transcode and then choose the <strong>Create Video Proxy</strong> option from the right-click menu. Just keep in mind that you must create proxy files before you do any actual editing because otherwise, the transcoding process is not going work.</p>

<p><strong>Compatibility:</strong> Linux, macOS, Windows</p>
<p>Blender is a 3D modeling and VFX software that lets you track objects or use 3D painting tools among numerous other options. Even though creating proxies with this app is not a particularly complicated process, you still have to be familiar with Blender in order to make full use of its transcoding options. The software allows you to generate proxy files whose size is only <strong>25% of the video’s original size</strong>, although you can also create proxies that have <strong>50% and 75%</strong> of the video’s original size. After you’ve adjusted the transcoding settings you should simply click on the <strong>Rebuild Proxy and Timecode Indices</strong> button.</p>
<h4 id="6-Shotcut-3"><a href="#6-Shotcut-3" class="headerlink" title="6. Shotcut"></a>6. <a class="link"   target="_blank" rel="noopener" href="https://shotcut.org/" >Shotcut <i class="fa-regular fa-arrow-up-right-from-square fa-sm"></i></a></h4><p><strong>Price:</strong> Free</p>
<p><strong>Compatibility:</strong> Windows, macOS, Linux</p>
<p>Despite the fact that this cross-platform video editor <strong>supports 4K and ProRes files</strong> that can cause it to lag at times, creating proxies in Shotcut is a highly technical process. In case you decide to make a proxy file by yourself, you will have to <strong>export a version of the file that is two or four times smaller than the original</strong>. You must also remember that you have to go through the entire process of creating proxies before you make any edits. The trick to creating proxies in Shotcut is to <strong>make a project file with the larger version of the video, then replace the larger version of the file with a smaller version of that same video file</strong>, before you actually start editing. Once you’ve completed the editing process, you can then once again add the larger source file to the project and export your video in high resolution.</p>
<h4 id="7-Lightworks-3"><a href="#7-Lightworks-3" class="headerlink" title="7.

<p><strong>Compatibility:</strong> Linux, macOS, Windows</p>
<p>The process of creating proxies in Lightworks is rather simple since you just have to import the video files you’d like to edit into the software and make sure they are selected before you right-click on them. Once the right-click menu appears on the screen you should click on the <strong>Media submenu</strong> and select the <strong>Make Proxies</strong> option. The amount of time Lightworks is going to need to generate the proxy files depends on the number of the source files and their size. You can then proceed to add the proxies to the timeline, edit them and Lightworks will automatically use the source files instead of proxies during the rendering process.</p>

<li><strong>3D Motion:</strong> Such type of transition effects tries to manipulate selected clips in the space. For instance, if you apply flip over transition in this 3D motion category then one clip will simply flip over screen in such a manner that secondary clip below it gets revealed in appealing manner.</li>
<li><strong>Dissolve:</strong> In this type of transition effect, one scene completely melds into another scene. You can describe such type of blends with terms like fade out and fade in from or to a bank image.</li>
</ul>
<p>Effects folders usually contain stylistically similar kind of transitions, but the result different appearances are on screen.</p>

<h2 id="How-to-Set-Up-Computer-for-Premiere"><a href="#How-to-Set-Up-Computer-for-Premiere" class="headerlink" title="How to Set Up Computer for Premiere"></a>How to Set Up Computer for Premiere</h2><h4 id="1-Processor"><a href="#1-Processor" class="headerlink" title="1. Processor"></a>1. Processor</h4><p>Whilst the software will run on a Core2Duo intel or Phenom II AMD processor, it is worth noting that <a class="link"   target="_blank" rel="noopener" href="https://www.cgdirector.com/best-cpu-for-rendering/" >rendering can be highly intensive work for the processor <i class="fa-regular fa-arrow-up-right-from-square fa-sm"></i></a> and the fastest possible processor within your budget will pay dividends in speed of editing. In general, even a Core I3, the cheapest of the current Intel range, will be significantly faster than older processors, but because Premiere happily uses multi cored processors to their full, if the budget can reach to a quad core or more processor then do so, Premiere is a piece of software that benefits from the computational power increase more than most.</p>
<h4 id="2-Memory"><a href="#2-Memory" class="headerlink" title="2. Memory"></a>2. Memory</h4><p>The next consideration is memory. The minimum specification suggests 4GB of RAM with 8GB recommended, for reliable and smooth running consider 8GB minimum, and go for as much as you can. For a computer that is used for other activities as well, multitasking can see even 24GB of Ram being fully utilized, especially if you are working on HD content. Speaking of content, this is the other aspect of memory to look at. Whilst you can use a storage drive that contains everything else on your computer to keep the media you are working on, for HD content especially, and for trouble free and the fastest possible operation it is advisable to reserve a single drive, preferably a 7200 RPM or faster one, exclusively for your media. Bandwidth and access times means Premiere will be significantly faster in operation with its media on a dedicated drive.</p>
<h4 id="3-Graphic"><a href="#3-Graphic" class="headerlink" title="3. Graphic"></a>3. Graphic</h4><p>The final aspect of specification to consider is graphics. Adobe Premiere uses a feature called the Mercury Playback Engine that allows much faster and smoother playback of video without rendering, it has two modes, software only and <a class="link"   target="_blank" rel="noopener" href="https://www.techopedia.com/definition/32876/gpu-accelerated-computing" >GPU acceleration mode <i class="fa-regular fa-arrow-up-right-from-square fa-sm"></i></a> (Using either CUDA or OpenCL). The GPU acceleration mode offers significant performance increases and is therefore highly desirable. However, not all GPU’s are compatible with the Mercury Playback Engine, the list of those that are is found on the previously linked specification page, so if a new computer is being built or purchased, or upgrades are being considered prior to install, it is highly desirable to utilize a compatible GPU where possible.</p>
<h4 id="5-Settings"><a href="#5-Settings" class="headerlink" title="5. Settings"></a>5. Settings</h4><p>Having covered the basic specifications of a computer that will enhance the operation of Premiere, it is now time to look at the computer settings and how this can affect Premiere’s performance and usability.</p>
<p>The first thing to understand is that video editing, especially HD video, is bandwidth intensive, in effect, it fills up the lanes between the CPU, RAM, GPU and Hard Drive during operation. Spreading the use of that bandwidth over several devices can see huge performance gains, so one of the best ways to optimize the computer for Premier is to adjust how the hard drives are used. How effective this can be depends on the computer you are using, so we will try to cover a few different possibilities here.</p>
<h4 id="6-Drive"><a href="#6-Drive" class="headerlink" title="6. Drive"></a>6. Drive</h4><p>If your computer contains a single drive, simply install Premiere and start using it, there are no options available here. If there are two drives, keep one for the operating system, programs and cache files. Use the second drive exclusively for video project files, exported projects and previews.</p>
<p>If the computer has three drives then keep one for the operating system and programs, the second one for the video project files, and use the third for previews, cache files and exported projects.</p>
<p>If you have access to even more drives, then split the cache from the previews, and ultimately have one drive each for previews, exports and cache. Spreading the files across as many drives as possible enhances performance by enabling the different read&#x2F;write operations to occur without interference from each other.</p>
<p>That is the theory, but how do you achieve this? This is done within Premiere itself, there are two parts, accessing where the media cache files are placed is done though the edit menu, following the path edit &gt; preferences &gt; media.</p>
<p><img  
                     lazyload
                     src="/images/loading.svg"

                      alt="adobe premiere requirements" title="adobe premiere requirements"
                ></p>
<p>Changing where the project files, previews and exports are stored is just as easy, and is accessed via the project menu by taking the path project &gt; project settings &gt; scratchdisks.</p>
<p><img  
                     lazyload
                     src="/images/loading.svg"
                     data-src="https://images.wondershare.com/images/multimedia/video-editor/adobe-premiere-2.png"
                      alt="adobe premiere requirements" title="adobe premiere requirements"
                ></p>
<h4 id="7-Sequence-Setting"><a href="#7-Sequence-Setting" class="headerlink" title="7. Sequence Setting"></a>7. Sequence Setting</h4><p>When working with Premiere it is important to have the correct settings for the type of media you are using and the nature of the final output. This is done within Premiere by a function known as a Sequence.</p>
<p>After creating a new project you are presented with the sequence dialogue box. You can have as many sequences in a single project as you like, but Premiere always assumes you require at least one and so needs the first one to be created to allow work on a project. Any media, both audio and video, placed into a sequence is automatically adapted to the settings of that sequence, so you will want to choose settings that match the original media as closely as possible. Each sequence in a project can have different settings if required, as this lessens the workload on the CPU and makes the process faster and smoother.</p>
<p>The sequence dialogue has three tabs, Sequence Presets, Settings and Tracks</p>
<p>The Preset Tab makes setting up a new sequence much simpler. Choosing a preset enables Premiere to choose the settings that best match the chosen video and audio format. There are a wide range of presets available to suit the most commonly used media types, they are organized based on camera formats. Within each group there are numerous settings and configurations to choose from based around frame sizes and interlacing. Whilst choosing the correct preset can be a little daunting to the uninitiated, ensuring the number of frames per second, the frame size and codec are correct is all that is required.</p>
<p><img  
                     lazyload
                     src="/images/loading.svg"
                     data-src="https://images.wondershare.com/images/multimedia/video-editor/adobe-premiere-3.png"
                      alt="adobe premiere requirements" title="adobe premiere requirements"
                ></p>
<p>Once the preset is chosen you can move to the settings tab to adjust the preset manually. Some settings will not be adjustable in this tab due to the specific optimization required for the input media.</p>
<p>Because the presets do such a good job it is not really necessary to adjust anything in the settings tab, and unless you are trying to do something very specific.</p>
<p>While the standard presets are usually suitable, on occasion you may desire a custom setting. To do this, choose a sequence preset that is close to your media, and then make custom selections in the Settings tab. By selecting the Save Preset option on the Settings tab you can then create a custom setting with those parameters. Give the preset a suitable name in the Save Settings dialog and add any notes that are needed. The preset can be found in the Custom folder under Available Presets.</p>
<p>Those with the Apple Prores Codec on their computers can use this as the preview codec if required. By choosing Quicktime as the preview format in a custom editing mode, and lastly Apple Prores as the required codec.</p>
<h2 id="Conclusion-4"><a href="#Conclusion-4" class="headerlink" title="Conclusion"></a>Conclusion</h2><p>If your computer failed to meet the requirement to run Premiere Pro, you may need to spend some money to buy a powerful computer or choose another professional video editing software similar to Premiere Pro, or choose a video editing software. If your computer isn’t powerful enough to run Premiere Pro, you will get awful experience at editing footage because of the long loading time and stuck playback.</p>

<p>That is the theory, but how do you achieve this? This is done within Premiere itself, there are two parts, accessing where the media cache files are placed is done though the edit menu, following the path edit &gt; preferences &gt; media.</p>

<h4 id="7-Sequence-Setting-1"><a href="#7-Sequence-Setting-1" class="headerlink" title="7. Sequence Setting"></a>7. Sequence Setting</h4><p>When working with Premiere it is important to have the correct settings for the type of media you are using and the nature of the final output. This is done within Premiere by a function known as a Sequence.</p>
<p>After creating a new project you are presented with the sequence dialogue box. You can have as many sequences in a single project as you like, but Premiere always assumes you require at least one and so needs the first one to be created to allow work on a project. Any media, both audio and video, placed into a sequence is automatically adapted to the settings of that sequence, so you will want to choose settings that match the original media as closely as possible. Each sequence in a project can have different settings if required, as this lessens the workload on the CPU and makes the process faster and smoother.</p>
<p>The sequence dialogue has three tabs, Sequence Presets, Settings and Tracks</p>
<p>The Preset Tab makes setting up a new sequence much simpler. Choosing a preset enables Premiere to choose the settings that best match the chosen video and audio format. There are a wide range of presets available to suit the most commonly used media types, they are organized based on camera formats. Within each group there are numerous settings and configurations to choose from based around frame sizes and interlacing. Whilst choosing the correct preset can be a little daunting to the uninitiated, ensuring the number of frames per second, the frame size and codec are correct is all that is required.</p>
<p><img  
                     lazyload
                     src="/images/loading.svg"
                     data-src="https://images.wondershare.com/images/multimedia/video-editor/adobe-premiere-3.png"
                      alt="adobe premiere requirements" title="adobe premiere requirements"
                ></p>
<p>Once the preset is chosen you can move to the settings tab to adjust the preset manually. Some settings will not be adjustable in this tab due to the specific optimization required for the input media.</p>
<p>Because the presets do such a good job it is not really necessary to adjust anything in the settings tab, and unless you are trying to do something very specific.</p>
<p>While the standard presets are usually suitable, on occasion you may desire a custom setting. To do this, choose a sequence preset that is close to your media, and then make custom selections in the Settings tab. By selecting the Save Preset option on the Settings tab you can then create a custom setting with those parameters. Give the preset a suitable name in the Save Settings dialog and add any notes that are needed. The preset can be found in the Custom folder under Available Presets.</p>
<p>Those with the Apple Prores Codec on their computers can use this as the preview codec if required. By choosing Quicktime as the preview format in a custom editing mode, and lastly Apple Prores as the required codec.</p>
<h2 id="Conclusion-5"><a href="#Conclusion-5" class="headerlink" title="Conclusion"></a>Conclusion</h2><p>If your computer failed to meet the requirement to run Premiere Pro, you may need to spend some money to buy a powerful computer or choose another professional video editing software similar to Premiere Pro, or choose a video editing software. If your computer isn’t powerful enough to run Premiere Pro, you will get awful experience at editing footage because of the long loading time and stuck playback.</p>

<h2 id="How-to-Set-Up-Computer-for-Premiere-2"><a href="#How-to-Set-Up-Computer-for-Premiere-2" class="headerlink" title="How to Set Up Computer for Premiere"></a>How to Set Up Computer for Premiere</h2><h4 id="1-Processor-2"><a href="#1-Processor-2" class="headerlink" title="1. Processor"></a>1. Processor</h4><p>Whilst the software will run on a Core2Duo intel or Phenom II AMD processor, it is worth noting that <a class="link"   target="_blank" rel="noopener" href="https://www.cgdirector.com/best-cpu-for-rendering/" >rendering can be highly intensive work for the processor <i class="fa-regular fa-arrow-up-right-from-square fa-sm"></i></a> and the fastest possible processor within your budget will pay dividends in speed of editing. In general, even a Core I3, the cheapest of the current Intel range, will be significantly faster than older processors, but because Premiere happily uses multi cored processors to their full, if the budget can reach to a quad core or more processor then do so, Premiere is a piece of software that benefits from the computational power increase more than most.</p>
<h4 id="2-Memory-2"><a href="#2-Memory-2" class="headerlink" title="2. Memory"></a>2. Memory</h4><p>The next consideration is memory. The minimum specification suggests 4GB of RAM with 8GB recommended, for reliable and smooth running consider 8GB minimum, and go for as much as you can. For a computer that is used for other activities as well, multitasking can see even 24GB of Ram being fully utilized, especially if you are working on HD content. Speaking of content, this is the other aspect of memory to look at. Whilst you can use a storage drive that contains everything else on your computer to keep the media you are working on, for HD content especially, and for trouble free and the fastest possible operation it is advisable to reserve a single drive, preferably a 7200 RPM or faster one, exclusively for your media. Bandwidth and access times means Premiere will be significantly faster in operation with its media on a dedicated drive.</p>
<h4 id="3-Graphic-2"><a href="#3-Graphic-2" class="headerlink" title="3. Graphic"></a>3. Graphic</h4><p>The final aspect of specification to consider is graphics. Adobe Premiere uses a feature called the Mercury Playback Engine that allows much faster and smoother playback of video without rendering, it has two modes, software only and <a class="link"   target="_blank" rel="noopener" href="https://www.techopedia.com/definition/32876/gpu-accelerated-computing" >GPU acceleration mode <i class="fa-regular fa-arrow-up-right-from-square fa-sm"></i></a> (Using either CUDA or OpenCL). The GPU acceleration mode offers significant performance increases and is therefore highly desirable. However, not all GPU’s are compatible with the Mercury Playback Engine, the list of those that are is found on the previously linked specification page, so if a new computer is being built or purchased, or upgrades are being considered prior to install, it is highly desirable to utilize a compatible GPU where possible.</p>
<h4 id="5-Settings-2"><a href="#5-Settings-2" class="headerlink" title="5. Settings"></a>5. Settings</h4><p>Having covered the basic specifications of a computer that will enhance the operation of Premiere, it is now time to look at the computer settings and how this can affect Premiere’s performance and usability.</p>
<p>The first thing to understand is that video editing, especially HD video, is bandwidth intensive, in effect, it fills up the lanes between the CPU, RAM, GPU and Hard Drive during operation. Spreading the use of that bandwidth over several devices can see huge performance gains, so one of the best ways to optimize the computer for Premier is to adjust how the hard drives are used. How effective this can be depends on the computer you are using, so we will try to cover a few different possibilities here.</p>
<h4 id="6-Drive-2"><a href="#6-Drive-2" class="headerlink" title="6. Drive"></a>6. Drive</h4><p>If your computer contains a single drive, simply install Premiere and start using it, there are no options available here. If there are two drives, keep one for the operating system, programs and cache files. Use the second drive exclusively for video project files, exported projects and previews.</p>
<p>If the computer has three drives then keep one for the operating system and programs, the second one for the video project files, and use the third for previews, cache files and exported projects.</p>
<p>If you have access to even more drives, then split the cache from the previews, and ultimately have one drive each for previews, exports and cache. Spreading the files across as many drives as possible enhances performance by enabling the different read&#x2F;write operations to occur without interference from each other.</p>

<h4 id="7-Sequence-Setting-3"><a href="#7-Sequence-Setting-3" class="headerlink" title="7. Sequence Setting"></a>7. Sequence Setting</h4><p>When working with Premiere it is important to have the correct settings for the type of media you are using and the nature of the final output. This is done within Premiere by a function known as a Sequence.</p>
<p>After creating a new project you are presented with the sequence dialogue box. You can have as many sequences in a single project as you like, but Premiere always assumes you require at least one and so needs the first one to be created to allow work on a project. Any media, both audio and video, placed into a sequence is automatically adapted to the settings of that sequence, so you will want to choose settings that match the original media as closely as possible. Each sequence in a project can have different settings if required, as this lessens the workload on the CPU and makes the process faster and smoother.</p>
<p>The sequence dialogue has three tabs, Sequence Presets, Settings and Tracks</p>
<p>The Preset Tab makes setting up a new sequence much simpler. Choosing a preset enables Premiere to choose the settings that best match the chosen video and audio format. There are a wide range of presets available to suit the most commonly used media types, they are organized based on camera formats. Within each group there are numerous settings and configurations to choose from based around frame sizes and interlacing. Whilst choosing the correct preset can be a little daunting to the uninitiated, ensuring the number of frames per second, the frame size and codec are correct is all that is required.</p>
<p><img  
                     lazyload
                     src="/images/loading.svg"
                     data-src="https://images.wondershare.com/images/multimedia/video-editor/adobe-premiere-3.png"
                      alt="adobe premiere requirements" title="adobe premiere requirements"
                ></p>
<p>Once the preset is chosen you can move to the settings tab to adjust the preset manually. Some settings will not be adjustable in this tab due to the specific optimization required for the input media.</p>
<p>Because the presets do such a good job it is not really necessary to adjust anything in the settings tab, and unless you are trying to do something very specific.</p>
<p>While the standard presets are usually suitable, on occasion you may desire a custom setting. To do this, choose a sequence preset that is close to your media, and then make custom selections in the Settings tab. By selecting the Save Preset option on the Settings tab you can then create a custom setting with those parameters. Give the preset a suitable name in the Save Settings dialog and add any notes that are needed. The preset can be found in the Custom folder under Available Presets.</p>
<p>Those with the Apple Prores Codec on their computers can use this as the preview codec if required. By choosing Quicktime as the preview format in a custom editing mode, and lastly Apple Prores as the required codec.</p>
<h2 id="Conclusion-7"><a href="#Conclusion-7" class="headerlink" title="Conclusion"></a>Conclusion</h2><p>If your computer failed to meet the requirement to run Premiere Pro, you may need to spend some money to buy a powerful computer or choose another professional video editing software similar to Premiere Pro, or choose a video editing software. If your computer isn’t powerful enough to run Premiere Pro, you will get awful experience at editing footage because of the long loading time and stuck playback.</p>

                ></p>
<p>Before you open Cloud Stop Motion and start clicking pictures of your subject for your video, it is important to have a story in mind. So, create a storyboard to break down your stop motion video. You can sketch your plan frame by frame or write bulleted list of your frames. It will help you create your project efficiently, ensuring that you have taken pictures of all the frames that you need to tell your story.</p>
<p><img  
                     lazyload
                     src="/images/loading.svg"

                      alt="adding new project on cloud stop motion"
                ></p>
<p>Step 1: Once you have created your storyboard, open the app to go to the Cloud Stop Motion dashboard. Click on the new project button. Cloud Stop Motion needs access to your camera for capturing images. So, allow camera access.</p>
<p><img  
                     lazyload
                     src="/images/loading.svg"

                      alt="allowing access to camera on cloud stop motion"
                ></p>
<p>On the dashboard, go to the taking picture menu. Now place the subject at the center of your frame. Capture a few test shots to find the composition that you like. You can see the picture at the bottom of the timeline. If needed, adjust the position of your subject. Make sure that the location you choose has plenty of light. If not, you also use a lamp for good light.</p>
<p>Tip: Keeping your phone or camera steady while making your stop-motion project is the key. You can use a tripod, a selfie stick, or a gimbal to keep your device as still as possible. If you don’t own any of these, keep your device on something sturdy and make sure that you do not change its place until you capture all the images needed for your project. This way all your shots will be consistent.</p>
<p>Step 2: Move your subject or change its position and take a picture. Repeat the process until you complete your story. To make your stop-motion smooth, make small changes to the position of your subject between shots.</p>
<p><img  
                     lazyload
                     src="/images/loading.svg"

                      alt="capturing images on cloud stop motion"
                ></p>
<p>You can also add more frames per second. Generally, you should add 10 frames per second. But you can go for 25 frames per second to make a smoother video. All the pictures you snap are automatically added to the editor in chronological order.</p>
<p>Step 3: Once you have captured images for your project, add sound by going to the sound menu in the top left of the dashboard. You can record sounds, upload sounds, or select sounds from Cloud Stop Motion’s gallery. You can also add text to your Cloud Stop Motion project if you want.</p>
<p>Step 4: Click on play button to preview your project and see if your motion picture turned out as per your liking or not. If you do not like something, go back and make changes. Once done, download your video from cloudstop motion.</p>

<p>Step 1: Once you have created your storyboard, open the app to go to the Cloud Stop Motion dashboard. Click on the new project button. Cloud Stop Motion needs access to your camera for capturing images. So, allow camera access.</p>

                      alt="allowing access to camera on cloud stop motion"
                ></p>
<p>On the dashboard, go to the taking picture menu. Now place the subject at the center of your frame. Capture a few test shots to find the composition that you like. You can see the picture at the bottom of the timeline. If needed, adjust the position of your subject. Make sure that the location you choose has plenty of light. If not, you also use a lamp for good light.</p>
<p>Tip: Keeping your phone or camera steady while making your stop-motion project is the key. You can use a tripod, a selfie stick, or a gimbal to keep your device as still as possible. If you don’t own any of these, keep your device on something sturdy and make sure that you do not change its place until you capture all the images needed for your project. This way all your shots will be consistent.</p>
<p>Step 2: Move your subject or change its position and take a picture. Repeat the process until you complete your story. To make your stop-motion smooth, make small changes to the position of your subject between shots.</p>
<p><img  
                     lazyload

                      alt="capturing images on cloud stop motion"
                ></p>
<p>You can also add more frames per second. Generally, you should add 10 frames per second. But you can go for 25 frames per second to make a smoother video. All the pictures you snap are automatically added to the editor in chronological order.</p>
<p>Step 3: Once you have captured images for your project, add sound by going to the sound menu in the top left of the dashboard. You can record sounds, upload sounds, or select sounds from Cloud Stop Motion’s gallery. You can also add text to your Cloud Stop Motion project if you want.</p>
<p>Step 4: Click on play button to preview your project and see if your motion picture turned out as per your liking or not. If you do not like something, go back and make changes. Once done, download your video from cloudstop motion.</p>
