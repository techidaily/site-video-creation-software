Audio and video out of sync happens because a media player employs different parts of its kernel to process the AV-output. Though compressed into one codec pack, video files are bigger than audio, thus generating incorrect timing.  
 To sync up HD videos with audio, the [best free sync software](https://tools.techidaily.com/5kplayer/video-music-player/) adopts a flexible way of processing the sound and video output: With a shortcut panel, 5KPlayer offers _audio-video timing_ and subtitle-video adjust bar when you use it on Mac El Capitan or Windows 10\. You are free from worries in terms of audio/subtitle format, the freeware bolsters to play MP3 AAC FLAC WMA, etc soundtracks,[add subtitles in .srt, .ssa, .ass, .json, .aqt .sub](https://tools.techidaily.com/5kplayer/video-music-player/) to videos and make any adjustment as you please. First check out what' s your problem:

**1\. If You Have Audio Delays:**  
 Audio delays from the video is the common case. If you see a performer speaking without dialogue in accompany in a movie, or the sound comes out minutes later, this is a audio delay.  
 5KPlayer configures a 20-second scope to compensate for audio delay from video, drag the timing chart from middle to the right. By enabling manual adjustment of audio and video not in sync, better flexibility is obtained: If you resort to other sync software with automatic adjustment only, synchronization result may not bring it back to normal.  
**2\. If Audio leads The Video:**  
 Repeat the above method, drag the AV-sync timing chart from middle to the left according to your specific delays.  
**How to Sync Subtitles with Video:**  
[Ripping a DVD movie on Mac](https://tools.techidaily.com/5kplayer/products/) or on[Windows](https://tools.techidaily.com/5kplayer/products/), adding external subtitles to a movie, are two of the cases that lead to subtitles not in sync. Incorrect timing of subtitles, together with audio and video out of sync, may just aggravate things.  
 Adjusting subtitles is equally easy as how to sync audio and video with 5KPlayer: Below the AV-sync timing bar is the subtitle-video adjusting chart, supplying a full 20-second scope of adjustment.

**Reason for Audio And Video Out of Sync:**  
 An individual MKV, AVI, MP4 video contains a different AV-sync timing, when your video player fails to respect its data timing, audio and video out of sync happens. Yet how to sync audio and video is no difficult thing if you use a [universal media player](https://tools.techidaily.com/5kplayer/video-music-player/) which can recognize a wide array of [video codecs](https://tools.techidaily.com/5kplayer/video-music-player/). 5KPlayer, indeed, is one of the first-class video players, and by taking audio and video out of sync problems one step further, it handles [AirPlay delay](https://tools.techidaily.com/5kplayer/airplay/), which is often the case when you stream the sound of a movie to an AirPlay WiFi audio receiver. 

**Audio and Video Out of Sync When Streaming \[Solved\]**  
**1\. YouTube Audio Delay**  
 YouTube audio delay occurs when you watch a YouTube video clip in 1080p or higher resolutions in full screen. Installing a plug-in to sync audio and video may help, but at the cost of slowing down your webpage loading.   
 Alternatively, 5KPlayer may download a movie you like to your library, which is less likely to go out of sync. Even if it does, just sync audio and video according to steps above.
