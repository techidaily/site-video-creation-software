_“Is Dubsmash still good? What are some other dub apps like it that I can use?”_

With the availability of so many **video dubbing apps**, users have become a little confused about their features. These days, a lot of friends ask me about the best dub app that they can use. Ideally, the selection of a preferred dubbing app would depend on your requirements. Some apps have better editing features while others are more social. Therefore, to help you pick [the most appropriate video dubbing app](https://tools.techidaily.com/wondershare/filmora/download/) for your needs, I have decided to come up with this list.
