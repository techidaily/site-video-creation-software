 _Posted by [Kaylee Wood](https://www.quora.com/profile/Amanda-Hu-21) | Last update: January 28, 2021 | 3 Min Read_

_"Is there any video player which can bookmark in video at various places?"_ 

With **video bookmark** function, you can save parts of a video for easier access later. Especially for long movies, documentaries or net class recordings that need retrospections again and again, you can bookmark locations and start playback at where you left or choose whichever part to start. Hence, the best bookmark video player is introduced here to help mark videos for highlights.

### How to Create Video Bookmarks with 5KPlayer?

Detailed information about 5KPlayer’s Bookmark Manager:

* Mark certain parts of a video or audio file;
* Create bookmarks in video at various places and at several spots;
* Keep the bookmarks all in one place;
* Name the bookmarked videos with descriptive names;
* Keep the bookmarks forever, and remove them at any time;
* Also allows for resume playback.
* View bookmarks as thumnails.

#### **How-to guide:**

**Step 1.** Free download 5KPlayer, install and launch it on your computer.

**Step 2.** Open up a video that you want to bookmark with 5KPlayer.

**Step 3.** When the video is playing and when it reaches the part you want to bookmark, click on the "Bookmark" icon on the progress bar.

 Notice: Please name your video with a recognizable name and descriptions as you may have different videos to bookmark.

**Step 5.** Click on "Add bookmark" to save the part.
