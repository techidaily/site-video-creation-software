<p> Whilst the conventional mouse control allows you to perform any task that Premiere is capable of, for efficient workflow the keyboard shortcuts cannot be beaten. We all work a little differently, and thankfully Adobe understands that, so although here we will be concentrating on the standard keyboard layout, the keyboard shortcuts can be customized to be anything you want and saved as a custom profile, there are even presets already included for Avid Media Composer and <a class="link"   target="_blank" rel="noopener" href="https://tools.techidaily.com/wondershare/filmora/download/" >Final Cut Pro <i class="fa-regular fa-arrow-up-right-from-square fa-sm"></i></a> for those who are maybe transitioning from those packages or just prefer the way they work.</p>

<p> This is a basic tutorial about Adobe Premiere, professional video editing software. However, if video editing is new to you, consider <a class="link"   target="_blank" rel="noopener" href="https://tools.techidaily.com/wondershare/filmora/download/" >Wondershare Filmora (originally Wondershare Video Editor) <i class="fa-regular fa-arrow-up-right-from-square fa-sm"></i></a>, which is a powerful but easy-to-use tool for users just starting out.

<p> This is achieved by going through the path edit &gt; keyboard shortcuts as below:</p>
<p><img  
                     lazyload
                     src="/images/loading.svg"
                     data-src="https://images.wondershare.com/images/multimedia/video-editor/adobe-shortcut-1.jpg"
                      alt="Adobe Premiere Shortcut"
                ></p>
<p> Before we step into the most useful shortcuts, a brief note here on the different platforms, although I’m sure most readers are aware. The PC and Mac versions of the software do share the same basic shortcuts with the one caveat that where the PC uses the Control and Alt keys, the Mac has Command and Option keys instead. Other than that the functionality is the same. I’ll include the shortcuts for both platforms with each to make referencing easier.</p>
<h4 id="1Select-Window"><a href="#1Select-Window" class="headerlink" title="1Select Window"></a>1Select Window</h4><p> I’m starting with this one simply because I find it the most used of all, especially if like me you prefer a custom layout for all your windows. If your program monitor is hidden for instance, you can just press shift+4 and there it is. The shortcuts are the same for both platforms here.</p>
<ul>
<li>Audio Clip Mixer Shift+9</li>
<li>Audio Track Mixer Shift+6</li>
<li>Effect Controls Shift+5</li>
<li>Effects Shift+7</li>
<li>Media Browser Shift+8</li>
<li>Program Monitor Shift+4</li>
<li>Project Shift+1</li>
<li>Source Monitor Shift+2</li>
<li>Timelines Shift+3</li>
</ul>
<h4 id="2-Import"><a href="#2-Import" class="headerlink" title="2 Import"></a>2 Import</h4><p> Whilst the shortcuts for editing and manipulating clips are extremely important for efficient workflow, it should be remembered that those relating to the basic operation of the program are just as useful, as we see here. Using Control and I (Command and I on Mac) brings up the import media dialogue box instantly.</p>

                      alt="Adobe Premiere Shortcut"
                ></p>
<h4 id="3Capture-Panel"><a href="#3Capture-Panel" class="headerlink" title="3Capture Panel"></a>3Capture Panel</h4><p> There are multiple shortcuts that can be used within the capture panel, but because this is such an intrinsic aspect of the Premiere workflow, being the entry into a project for all media, I think the available shortcuts are all as valuable as each other here.</p>
<ul>
<li>Navigate Through Fields - Tab</li>
<li>Cancel Capture - Esc</li>
<li>Fast Forward - F</li>
<li>Rewind - R</li>
<li>Go to In Point - Q</li>
<li>Go to Out Point - W</li>
<li>Record - G</li>
<li>Stop - S</li>
<li>Step Back - Left Arrow</li>
<li>Step Forward - Right Arrow</li>

<h4 id="4-Timeline-Panel"><a href="#4-Timeline-Panel" class="headerlink" title="4 Timeline Panel"></a>4 Timeline Panel</h4><p> In a similar vein to the Capture Panel, the Timeline Panel has a set of shortcuts specific to all its basic operations, and are essential for a faster workflow.</p>
<ul>
<li>Clear Ins and Outs - G</li>
<li>Clear In Point - D</li>
<li>Clear Out Point - F</li>
<li>Go to In Point- Q</li>

<h4 id="5-Navigation-within-a-clip"><a href="#5-Navigation-within-a-clip" class="headerlink" title="5 Navigation within a clip"></a>5 Navigation within a clip</h4><p> This one works within the program monitor&#x2F;timeline or source monitor windows, ensure the desired one is active first of course. You can move to a specific time code within the clip, or go forwards or backwards a set number of frames using the number pad. To go to a specific time code simply type that on the number pad. To travel a set number of frames simply type + or – (to signify direction) and the number of frames.</p>
<h4 id="6Marking-Clips"><a href="#6Marking-Clips" class="headerlink" title="6Marking Clips"></a>6Marking Clips</h4><p> By far the simplest way to mark clips is to use the keyboard shortcut.</p>
<p> For marking clips use X , whilst marking a selection is &#x2F; .</p>
<h4 id="7-In-and-Out"><a href="#7-In-and-Out" class="headerlink" title="7 In and Out"></a>7 In and Out</h4><p> In addition to marking clips via shortcuts, it is also far easier to mark In and Out points this way.</p>
<ul>
<li>To Mark In use I , whilst to mark Out use O .</li>
<li>To Clear In the shortcut is Control+Shift+I for PC and Option+I for Mac.</li>
<li>To Clear Out Control+Shift+O for PC, Option+O for Mac.</li>
</ul>
<h4 id="8Playing-Clips"><a href="#8Playing-Clips" class="headerlink" title="8Playing Clips"></a>8Playing Clips</h4><p> Going hand in hand with the shortcuts for marking, are the keyboard commands for playing clips. These are:</p>
<ul>
<li>Play In to Out: Control+Shift+Space (PC) and Option+K for Mac</li>
<li>Clear In and Out: Control+Shift+X (PC) and Option+X for Mac</li>
<li>Play Around: The same for both platforms and is Shift+K.</li>
</ul>
<p> To get the best from this it is necessary to set some options beforehand, as Play Around plays the portion of the timeline around the Playhead, and where it plays is dependent on the options set. This is done through the menu via edit &gt; preferences &gt; playback, here I have preroll and postroll set to 4 seconds, meaning that it plays 4 seconds prior and following the point where the playhead is placed.</p>
<p><img  
                     lazyload

                      alt="Adobe Premiere Shortcut"
                ></p>
<p> In addition, turning on looping for this can help to fine tune edits.</p>
<h4 id="9Toggle-Audio-During-Scrubbing"><a href="#9Toggle-Audio-During-Scrubbing" class="headerlink" title="9Toggle Audio During Scrubbing"></a>9Toggle Audio During Scrubbing</h4><p> There are times you may want to hear audio when scrubbing, however turning it off can have beneficial effects on performance for lower end computers. The shortcut makes it an easy process to turn off and on as required.</p>
<p> The shortcut is Shift+S for both platforms.</p>
<h4 id="10Slide-a-clip-within-the-sequence"><a href="#10Slide-a-clip-within-the-sequence" class="headerlink" title="10Slide a clip within the sequence"></a>10Slide a clip within the sequence</h4><p> There are a couple of options available here from the shortcuts, slide one frame or 5 frames.</p>
<ul>
<li>To slide one frame to the left is Alt+, for PC or Option+, for Mac. To increase to five frames add Shift to either shortcut.</li>
<li>To slide one frame to the right is Alt+. for PC and Option+. for Mac. Again, to increase to five frames add Shift.</li>
</ul>
<h4 id="11Slip-within-a-sequence"><a href="#11Slip-within-a-sequence" class="headerlink" title="11Slip within a sequence"></a>11Slip within a sequence</h4><p> As with the slide options, the choice is one frame or five frames.</p>
<ul>
<li>To slip one frame to the left is Control+Alt+Left for PC or Option+Command+Left for Mac. To increase to five frames add Shift to either shortcut.</li>
<li>To slip one frame to the right is Control+Alt+Right for PC and Option+Command+Right for Mac. Again, to increase to five frames add Shift.</li>
</ul>
<h4 id="12Nudging"><a href="#12Nudging" class="headerlink" title="12Nudging"></a>12Nudging</h4><p> You can move a clip up or down simply by using the Up and Down arrow keys, whilst holding Alt or Option at the same time allows you to select just the video or audio to move.</p>
<h4 id="13Multi-Camera-Selection"><a href="#13Multi-Camera-Selection" class="headerlink" title="13Multi Camera Selection"></a>13Multi Camera Selection</h4><p> This is a tool that allows you to work with multiple camera angles of the same subject or scene. To switch between different cameras quickly is extremely useful and accomplished with the numerical keys.</p>
<p> Numbers 1 through 9 select the corresponding camera.</p>
<h4 id="14Add-an-edit"><a href="#14Add-an-edit" class="headerlink" title="14Add an edit"></a>14Add an edit</h4><p> This option cuts the track (or tracks) that are targeted. The shortcut for this is Control+K or Command+K.</p>
<p> You can view all added edits within a sequence by selecting show through edits within the sequence menu.</p>
<p><img

<h4 id="15Add-the-default-Transition"><a href="#15Add-the-default-Transition" class="headerlink" title="15Add the default Transition"></a>15Add the default Transition</h4><p> This option applies the default transition to all selected media. To do this use Shift+D.</p>
<h4 id="16-Match-Frame"><a href="#16-Match-Frame" class="headerlink" title="16 Match Frame"></a>16 Match Frame</h4><p> Locating a specific frame within the sequence for adding in a second clip is very useful, the shortcut is M, a great timesaver.</p>
<h4 id="17Zoom-to-sequence"><a href="#17Zoom-to-sequence" class="headerlink" title="17Zoom to sequence"></a>17Zoom to sequence</h4><p> Being able to zoom in is great, it makes working in the sequence panel much easier, at least for me, however the one drawback I find is that I tend to get lost when looking for a particular clip. Using &#x2F; enable you to quickly zoom out for navigation and back in again to work</p>
<h4 id="18Jump-to-Edit"><a href="#18Jump-to-Edit" class="headerlink" title="18Jump to Edit"></a>18Jump to Edit</h4><p> Navigating from edit to edit is a very simple process with the shortcuts available to you.</p>
<p> Page up takes you to the previous edit point, whilst page down takes you to the next.</p>
<p> With practice these shortcuts become second nature and you will find your workflow becomes not only faster but a smoother operation as well.</p>
<h4 id="19Toggle-the-type-of-Trim-used"><a href="#19Toggle-the-type-of-Trim-used" class="headerlink" title="19Toggle the type of Trim used"></a>19Toggle the type of Trim used</h4><p> Quickly shift between Standard, Ripple and Roll trim types.</p>
<p> Shift+T for PC, Control+T for Mac</p>
<h4 id="20Ripple-Trim"><a href="#20Ripple-Trim" class="headerlink" title="20Ripple Trim"></a>20Ripple Trim</h4><p> This enables you to trim the head or tail of the clip very quickly, making an extremely efficient workflow. To trim the next edit from the Playhead use W, for the previous edit from the playhead use Q.</p>

<p> Whilst the conventional mouse control allows you to perform any task that Premiere is capable of, for efficient workflow the keyboard shortcuts cannot be beaten. We all work a little differently, and thankfully Adobe understands that, so although here we will be concentrating on the standard keyboard layout, the keyboard shortcuts can be customized to be anything you want and saved as a custom profile, there are even presets already included for Avid Media Composer and <a class="link"   target="_blank" rel="noopener" href="https://tools.techidaily.com/wondershare/filmora/download/" >Final Cut Pro <i class="fa-regular fa-arrow-up-right-from-square fa-sm"></i></a> for those who are maybe transitioning from those packages or just prefer the way they work.</p>

<p> This is a basic tutorial about Adobe Premiere, professional video editing software. However, if video editing is new to you, consider <a class="link"   target="_blank" rel="noopener" href="https://tools.techidaily.com/wondershare/filmora/download/" >Wondershare Filmora (originally Wondershare Video Editor) <i class="fa-regular fa-arrow-up-right-from-square fa-sm"></i></a>, which is a powerful but easy-to-use tool for users just starting out.

<p> This is achieved by going through the path edit &gt; keyboard shortcuts as below:</p>
<p><img  
                     lazyload
                     src="/images/loading.svg"

                ></p>
<p> Before we step into the most useful shortcuts, a brief note here on the different platforms, although I’m sure most readers are aware. The PC and Mac versions of the software do share the same basic shortcuts with the one caveat that where the PC uses the Control and Alt keys, the Mac has Command and Option keys instead. Other than that the functionality is the same. I’ll include the shortcuts for both platforms with each to make referencing easier.</p>
<h4 id="1Select-Window-1"><a href="#1Select-Window-1" class="headerlink" title="1Select Window"></a>1Select Window</h4><p> I’m starting with this one simply because I find it the most used of all, especially if like me you prefer a custom layout for all your windows. If your program monitor is hidden for instance, you can just press shift+4 and there it is. The shortcuts are the same for both platforms here.</p>
<ul>
<li>Audio Clip Mixer Shift+9</li>
<li>Audio Track Mixer Shift+6</li>
<li>Effect Controls Shift+5</li>
<li>Effects Shift+7</li>
<li>Media Browser Shift+8</li>
<li>Program Monitor Shift+4</li>
<li>Project Shift+1</li>
<li>Source Monitor Shift+2</li>
<li>Timelines Shift+3</li>
</ul>
<h4 id="2-Import-1"><a href="#2-Import-1" class="headerlink" title="2 Import"></a>2 Import</h4><p> Whilst the shortcuts for editing and manipulating clips are extremely important for efficient workflow, it should be remembered that those relating to the basic operation of the program are just as useful, as we see here. Using Control and I (Command and I on Mac) brings up the import media dialogue box instantly.</p>

<h4 id="3Capture-Panel-1"><a href="#3Capture-Panel-1" class="headerlink" title="3Capture Panel"></a>3Capture Panel</h4><p> There are multiple shortcuts that can be used within the capture panel, but because this is such an intrinsic aspect of the Premiere workflow, being the entry into a project for all media, I think the available shortcuts are all as valuable as each other here.</p>
<ul>
<li>Navigate Through Fields - Tab</li>
<li>Cancel Capture - Esc</li>
<li>Fast Forward - F</li>

We all work a little differently, and thankfully Adobe understands that, so although here we will be concentrating on the standard keyboard layout, the keyboard shortcuts can be customized to be anything you want and saved as a custom profile, there are even presets already included for Avid Media Composer and <a class="link"   target="_blank" rel="noopener" href="https://tools.techidaily.com/wondershare/filmora/download/" >Final Cut Pro <i class="fa-regular fa-arrow-up-right-from-square fa-sm"></i></a> for those who are maybe transitioning from those packages or just prefer the way they work.</p>

<p> This is a basic tutorial about Adobe Premiere, professional video editing software. However, if video editing is new to you, consider <a class="link"   target="_blank" rel="noopener" href="https://tools.techidaily.com/wondershare/filmora/download/" >Wondershare Filmora (originally Wondershare Video Editor) <i class="fa-regular fa-arrow-up-right-from-square fa-sm"></i></a>, which is a powerful but easy-to-use tool for users just starting out.

<p> This is achieved by going through the path edit &gt; keyboard shortcuts as below:</p>
<p><img

                     src="/images/loading.svg"
                     data-src="https://images.wondershare.com/images/multimedia/video-editor/adobe-shortcut-1.jpg"
                      alt="Adobe Premiere Shortcut"
                ></p>
<p> Before we step into the most useful shortcuts, a brief note here on the different platforms, although I’m sure most readers are aware. The PC and Mac versions of the software do share the same basic shortcuts with the one caveat that where the PC uses the Control and Alt keys, the Mac has Command and Option keys instead. Other than that the functionality is the same. I’ll include the shortcuts for both platforms with each to make referencing easier.</p>
<h4 id="1Select-Window-2"><a href="#1Select-Window-2" class="headerlink" title="1Select Window"></a>1Select Window</h4><p> I’m starting with this one simply because I find it the most used of all, especially if like me you prefer a custom layout for all your windows. If your program monitor is hidden for instance, you can just press shift+4 and there it is. The shortcuts are the same for both platforms here.</p>
<ul>
<li>Audio Clip Mixer Shift+9</li>
<li>Audio Track Mixer Shift+6</li>
<li>Effect Controls Shift+5</li>
<li>Effects Shift+7</li>
<li>Media Browser Shift+8</li>
<li>Program Monitor Shift+4</li>
<li>Project Shift+1</li>
<li>Source Monitor Shift+2</li>
<li>Timelines Shift+3</li>
</ul>
<h4 id="2-Import-2"><a href="#2-Import-2" class="headerlink" title="2 Import"></a>2 Import</h4><p> Whilst the shortcuts for editing and manipulating clips are extremely important for efficient workflow, it should be remembered that those relating to the basic operation of the program are just as useful, as we see here. Using Control and I (Command and I on Mac) brings up the import media dialogue box instantly.</p>
<p><img  
                     lazyload
                     src="/images/loading.svg"

                      alt="Adobe Premiere Shortcut"
                ></p>
<h4 id="3Capture-Panel-2"><a href="#3Capture-Panel-2" class="headerlink" title="3Capture Panel"></a>3Capture Panel</h4><p> There are multiple shortcuts that can be used within the capture panel, but because this is such an intrinsic aspect of the Premiere workflow, being the entry into a project for all media, I think the available shortcuts are all as valuable as each other here.</p>
<ul>
<li>Navigate Through Fields - Tab</li>
<li>Cancel Capture - Esc</li>
<li>Fast Forward - F</li>
<li>Rewind - R</li>
<li>Go to In Point - Q</li>
<li>Go to Out Point - W</li>
<li>Record - G</li>
<li>Stop - S</li>
<li>Step Back - Left Arrow</li>
<li>Step Forward - Right Arrow</li>
</ul>

                ></p>
<h4 id="4-Timeline-Panel-2"><a href="#4-Timeline-Panel-2" class="headerlink" title="4 Timeline Panel"></a>4 Timeline Panel</h4><p> In a similar vein to the Capture Panel, the Timeline Panel has a set of shortcuts specific to all its basic operations, and are essential for a faster workflow.</p>
<ul>
<li>Clear Ins and Outs - G</li>
<li>Clear In Point - D</li>
<li>Clear Out Point - F</li>
<li>Go to In Point- Q</li>
<li>Go to Out Point - W</li>
<li>Match Frame - M</li>
<li>Start and Stop - Spacebar</li>
<li>Play Normal Speed - L</li>
<li>Play Reverse Normal Speed - J</li>
<li>Set In Point - I</li>
<li>Set Out Point - o</li>
<li>Shuttle Stop - K</li>
<li>Trim - T</li>
<li>Arc Tool - A</li>
<li>Ellipse Tool – E</li>
</ul>
<p><img  
                     lazyload
                     src="/images/loading.svg"
                     data-src="https://images.wondershare.com/images/multimedia/video-editor/adobe-shotcut-4.jpg"
                      alt="Adobe Premiere Shortcut"
                ></p>
<h4 id="5-Navigation-within-a-clip-2"><a href="#5-Navigation-within-a-clip-2" class="headerlink" title="5 Navigation within a clip"></a>5 Navigation within a clip</h4><p> This one works within the program monitor&#x2F;timeline or source monitor windows, ensure the desired one is active first of course. You can move to a specific time code within the clip, or go forwards or backwards a set number of frames using the number pad. To go to a specific time code simply type that on the number pad. To travel a set number of frames simply type + or – (to signify direction) and the number of frames.</p>
<h4 id="6Marking-Clips-2"><a href="#6Marking-Clips-2" class="headerlink" title="6Marking Clips"></a>6Marking Clips</h4><p> By far the simplest way to mark clips is to use the keyboard shortcut.</p>
<p> For marking clips use X , whilst marking a selection is &#x2F; .</p>
<h4 id="7-In-and-Out-2"><a href="#7-In-and-Out-2" class="headerlink" title="7 In and Out"></a>7 In and Out</h4><p> In addition to marking clips via shortcuts, it is also far easier to mark In and Out points this way.</p>
<ul>
<li>To Mark In use I , whilst to mark Out use O .</li>
<li>To Clear In the shortcut is Control+Shift+I for PC and Option+I for Mac.</li>
<li>To Clear Out Control+Shift+O for PC, Option+O for Mac.</li>
</ul>
<h4 id="8Playing-Clips-2"><a href="#8Playing-Clips-2" class="headerlink" title="8Playing Clips"></a>8Playing Clips</h4><p> Going hand in hand with the shortcuts for marking, are the keyboard commands for playing clips. These are:</p>
<ul>
<li>Play In to Out: Control+Shift+Space (PC) and Option+K for Mac</li>
<li>Clear In and Out: Control+Shift+X (PC) and Option+X for Mac</li>
<li>Play Around: The same for both platforms and is Shift+K.</li>
</ul>
<p> To get the best from this it is necessary to set some options beforehand, as Play Around plays the portion of the timeline around the Playhead, and where it plays is dependent on the options set. This is done through the menu via edit &gt; preferences &gt; playback, here I have preroll and postroll set to 4 seconds, meaning that it plays 4 seconds prior and following the point where the playhead is placed.</p>
<p><img  
                     lazyload
                     src="/images/loading.svg"
                     data-src="https://images.wondershare.com/images/multimedia/video-editor/adobe-shotcut-5.jpg"
                      alt="Adobe Premiere Shortcut"
                ></p>
<p> In addition, turning on looping for this can help to fine tune edits.</p>
<h4 id="9Toggle-Audio-During-Scrubbing-2"><a href="#9Toggle-Audio-During-Scrubbing-2" class="headerlink" title="9Toggle Audio During Scrubbing"></a>9Toggle Audio During Scrubbing</h4><p> There are times you may want to hear audio when scrubbing, however turning it off can have beneficial effects on performance for lower end computers. The shortcut makes it an easy process to turn off and on as required.</p>
<p> The shortcut is Shift+S for both platforms.</p>
<h4 id="10Slide-a-clip-within-the-sequence-2"><a href="#10Slide-a-clip-within-the-sequence-2" class="headerlink" title="10Slide a clip within the sequence"></a>10Slide a clip within the sequence</h4><p> There are a couple of options available here from the shortcuts, slide one frame or 5 frames.</p>
<ul>
<li>To slide one frame to the left is Alt+, for PC or Option+, for Mac. To increase to five frames add Shift to either shortcut.</li>
<li>To slide one frame to the right is Alt+. for PC and Option+. for Mac. Again, to increase to five frames add Shift.</li>
</ul>
<h4 id="11Slip-within-a-sequence-2"><a href="#11Slip-within-a-sequence-2" class="headerlink" title="11Slip within a sequence"></a>11Slip within a sequence</h4><p> As with the slide options, the choice is one frame or five frames.</p>
<ul>
<li>To slip one frame to the left is Control+Alt+Left for PC or Option+Command+Left for Mac. To increase to five frames add Shift to either shortcut.</li>
<li>To slip one frame to the right is Control+Alt+Right for PC and Option+Command+Right for Mac. Again, to increase to five frames add Shift.</li>
</ul>
<h4 id="12Nudging-2"><a href="#12Nudging-2" class="headerlink" title="12Nudging"></a>12Nudging</h4><p> You can move a clip up or down simply by using the Up and Down arrow keys, whilst holding Alt or Option at the same time allows you to select just the video or audio to move.</p>
<h4 id="13Multi-Camera-Selection-2"><a href="#13Multi-Camera-Selection-2" class="headerlink" title="13Multi Camera Selection"></a>13Multi Camera Selection</h4><p> This is a tool that allows you to work with multiple camera angles of the same subject or scene. To switch between different cameras quickly is extremely useful and accomplished with the numerical keys.</p>
<p> Numbers 1 through 9 select the corresponding camera.</p>
<h4 id="14Add-an-edit-2"><a href="#14Add-an-edit-2" class="headerlink" title="14Add an edit"></a>14Add an edit</h4><p> This option cuts the track (or tracks) that are targeted. The shortcut for this is Control+K or Command+K.</p>
<p> You can view all added edits within a sequence by selecting show through edits within the sequence menu.</p>
<p><img  
                     lazyload
                     src="/images/loading.svg"
                     data-src="https://images.wondershare.com/images/multimedia/video-editor/adobe-shotcut-6.jpg"
                      alt="Adobe Premiere Shortcut"
                ></p>
<h4 id="15Add-the-default-Transition-2"><a href="#15Add-the-default-Transition-2" class="headerlink" title="15Add the default Transition"></a>15Add the default Transition</h4><p> This option applies the default transition to all selected media. To do this use Shift+D.</p>
<h4 id="16-Match-Frame-2"><a href="#16-Match-Frame-2" class="headerlink" title="16 Match Frame"></a>16 Match Frame</h4><p> Locating a specific frame within the sequence for adding in a second clip is very useful, the shortcut is M, a great timesaver.</p>
<h4 id="17Zoom-to-sequence-2"><a href="#17Zoom-to-sequence-2" class="headerlink" title="17Zoom to sequence"></a>17Zoom to sequence</h4><p> Being able to zoom in is great, it makes working in the sequence panel much easier, at least for me, however the one drawback I find is that I tend to get lost when looking for a particular clip. Using &#x2F; enable you to quickly zoom out for navigation and back in again to work</p>
<h4 id="18Jump-to-Edit-2"><a href="#18Jump-to-Edit-2" class="headerlink" title="18Jump to Edit"></a>18Jump to Edit</h4><p> Navigating from edit to edit is a very simple process with the shortcuts available to you.</p>
<p> Page up takes you to the previous edit point, whilst page down takes you to the next.</p>
<p> With practice these shortcuts become second nature and you will find your workflow becomes not only faster but a smoother operation as well.</p>
<h4 id="19Toggle-the-type-of-Trim-used-2"><a href="#19Toggle-the-type-of-Trim-used-2" class="headerlink" title="19Toggle the type of Trim used"></a>19Toggle the type of Trim used</h4><p> Quickly shift between Standard, Ripple and Roll trim types.</p>
<p> Shift+T for PC, Control+T for Mac</p>
<h4 id="20Ripple-Trim-2"><a href="#20Ripple-Trim-2" class="headerlink" title="20Ripple Trim"></a>20Ripple Trim</h4><p> This enables you to trim the head or tail of the clip very quickly, making an extremely efficient workflow. To trim the next edit from the Playhead use W, for the previous edit from the playhead use Q.</p>

<p>As it is now the second decade of the 21st century, data carriers like DVDs are slowly becoming obsolete. A growing number of laptop and desktop PCs no longer feature optical disc drives, while the discontinuation of the Windows Media Center marked the end of an era in which Windows OS offered a built-in DVD player.</p>
<p>The Windows 10 doesn’t have a native app that enables you to play movies or music from DVD and Blu-ray discs, and you must install a third-party DVD<a class="link"   target="_blank" rel="noopener" href="https://tools.techidaily.com/wondershare/filmora/download/" >video player <i class="fa-regular fa-arrow-up-right-from-square fa-sm"></i></a> if you want to view content from these sources.

A growing number of laptop and desktop PCs no longer feature optical disc drives, while the discontinuation of the Windows Media Center marked the end of an era in which Windows OS offered a built-in DVD player.</p>
<p>The Windows 10 doesn’t have a native app that enables you to play movies or music from DVD and Blu-ray discs, and you must install a third-party DVD<a class="link"   target="_blank" rel="noopener" href="https://tools.techidaily.com/wondershare/filmora/download/" >video player <i class="fa-regular fa-arrow-up-right-from-square fa-sm"></i></a> if you want to view content from these sources.

How to Use Stop Motion Studio?</h2><p>With the help of Stop Motion Studio, you can make animation by combining multiple pictures. You need to download Stop Motion Studio Pro for your iOS or Android device to use the app. You can also download it for PC.</p>
<p><img  
                     lazyload

                      alt="download stop motion studio"
                ></p>
<p>Step 1: Once you have downloaded the app, install it to work on your animation project right away. To create a new movie, click on the plus icon to create a new movie.</p>
<p><img  
                     lazyload

                      alt="adding new movie in stop motion studio"
                ></p>
<p>Step 2: Set the object you wish to capture in the frame. Let us consider one example where we will turn over an object. Click the camera icon to capture the shot. Move the thing a little and again tap on the shutter icon. Repeat the process until you have moved it all the way around. Once done, click on the play button. It will appear as if the object is in motion and moving on its own.</p>
<p><img  
                     lazyload
                     src="/images/loading.svg"

                      alt="changing frame rate on stop motion studio"
                ></p>
<p>Tip: To ensure that your object is in the right place, you can use different controls like grid and onion skin. The grid will give you an idea of where you placed the subject in the frame. The onion skin puts the last frame you captured on top of your camera’s live view. In this way, you can see how far you moved your subject between frames.</p>
<p>Step 3: You can click as many pictures as you need to convey your story. After clicking all the pictures, you can edit them as per your requirements. To increase or decrease the speed at which your video plays, change the frame rate by choosing the number of pictures to be shown per second when you play the video. Play the video to see how your work turned out. If you like the end result, exit the editor.</p>
<p>Step 4: Now select the animation that you just saved. Click on the export icon which you will find at the top left of the screen—select animated GIF from the pulldown menu. Export the file to Google drive, mail yourself or upload it on your social media profile. AirDrop the file to other iPhone users if you are an iPhone user.</p>

How to Use Stop Motion Studio?</h2><p>With the help of Stop Motion Studio, you can make animation by combining multiple pictures. You need to download Stop Motion Studio Pro for your iOS or Android device to use the app. You can also download it for PC.</p>
<p><img  
                     lazyload
                     src="/images/loading.svg"

                      alt="download stop motion studio"
                ></p>
<p>Step 1: Once you have downloaded the app, install it to work on your animation project right away. To create a new movie, click on the plus icon to create a new movie.</p>
<p><img  
                     lazyload
                     src="/images/loading.svg"

                      alt="adding new movie in stop motion studio"
                ></p>
<p>Step 2: Set the object you wish to capture in the frame. Let us consider one example where we will turn over an object. Click the camera icon to capture the shot. Move the thing a little and again tap on the shutter icon. Repeat the process until you have moved it all the way around. Once done, click on the play button. It will appear as if the object is in motion and moving on its own.</p>
<p><img  
                     lazyload

                      alt="changing frame rate on stop motion studio"
                ></p>
<p>Tip: To ensure that your object is in the right place, you can use different controls like grid and onion skin. The grid will give you an idea of where you placed the subject in the frame. The onion skin puts the last frame you captured on top of your camera’s live view. In this way, you can see how far you moved your subject between frames.</p>
<p>Step 3: You can click as many pictures as you need to convey your story. After clicking all the pictures, you can edit them as per your requirements. To increase or decrease the speed at which your video plays, change the frame rate by choosing the number of pictures to be shown per second when you play the video. Play the video to see how your work turned out. If you like the end result, exit the editor.</p>
<p>Step 4: Now select the animation that you just saved. Click on the export icon which you will find at the top left of the screen—select animated GIF from the pulldown menu. Export the file to Google drive, mail yourself or upload it on your social media profile. AirDrop the file to other iPhone users if you are an iPhone user.</p>
