## Let's Learn More about 4320p Video Playback

4320p or 8k full ultra HD resolution comes out to a minimum dimension of 7680x4320, 16 times that of mainstream 1080p resolution, and can go as high as 8192x8192\. Such high definition video always adopts H.265/HEVC codec which is able to handle the sheer number of pixels (33.2 million)! That is to say only media players support H.265/HEVC format are capable of playing 4320p UHD videos successfully.

 However, video players that give strong backing to [H.265/HEVC playback](https://tools.techidaily.com/5kplayer/video-music-player/) are very few. Meanwhile, user feedback shows that playing 4320p video on computer with 4320p players can be choppy.
