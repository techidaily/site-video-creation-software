Impressing your followers on social media with the content you share won’t be difficult if you decide to create that content with Adobe Spark. There are hundreds of templates available for various kinds of social media posts, so to create a photo collage you should just **pick a template**. You can **change the layout of the template** if you want to alter its original design and you can upload images from your computer or use **the Adobe Stock** option. The best part is that you can apply filters to all photos you add to a photo collage and make their colors more vivid.

#### 11. [Photo Collage Maker](https://photo-collage.net/photo-collage-maker/)

**Price:** $5.56 for a single image

Photo Collage Maker lets you choose from more than **250 photo collage templates** that are suitable for virtually any purpose. The number of pictures you can include in a photo collage can vary from just **two to more than 75** and it depends on the template you choose. You can also automatically desaturate all the images in a photo collage by clicking on the **B&W/Color icon** or **change the background** with a single click. Photo Collage Maker doesn’t offer any border options, so you can’t really control the spacing between the images. Downloading a 1-megapixel file from this platform is going to cost you $5.56.

## Conclusion

Combining multiple photos or videos and making collages that are going to attract a lot of attention on social media has never been easier. Hopefully the online collage makers, we included in this article will help you create photo and video collages that are going to impress your friends and colleagues.

In fact, through multiple updates, now we made it **super easy** to make a collage video with Filmora. Rather than making a photo collage, why not make a video collage?
