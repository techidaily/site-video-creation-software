_I uploaded some 1080p videos I took from my digital video camera to my computer. I want to add some effects to them, so I tried  After Effects CS4\. But in both programs, they didn’t play properly. Anyone know a better 1080p video editing software program?_

1080p video now can be easily captured by common devices such as cell phones or consumer camcorders. But some the editing software may have trouble importing or editing this kind of video sometimes. If you are looking for great 1080p video editing software, I highly recommend the [Wondershare Filmora](https://tools.techidaily.com/wondershare/filmora/download/).

* Easily rotate, split, crop and trim audio, videos and photos on the timeline
* Make your videos personal with filters, picture-in picture, transitions and many more features
