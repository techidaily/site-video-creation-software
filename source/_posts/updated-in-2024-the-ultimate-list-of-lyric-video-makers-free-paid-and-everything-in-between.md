You no longer need access to professional video editing apps if you want to process the footage recorded in the 4K resolution, apply the Chroma Key effect to a video clip, or color grade a video since there are several options that are available for less than a hundred dollars that allow you to do all these things and much more. Let’s take a look at some of the best video editing apps that are not going to burn a hole in your budget.

Purchasing video editing software is a long-term investment that will enable you to increase the quality of the videos you’re creating over time. This doesn’t mean that the videos you’re producing are going to become better overnight since most video editing apps only offer possibilities that can’t be properly utilized without proper video editing skills.

Well, If you haven't decided which one to go for so far, I would strongly recommend **Filmora** to you. It's **free** to try, you can download it with the buttons below, and click through to see if it matches your needs.
