**No.2 VLC Media Player -- Robust Open Source MKV Player** 

VLC Media Player is a well-known multi formats video player. Normally this MKV media player shouldn't have problems of playing MKV files as it natively support MKV video playback without installing codec.

However, sometimes when VLC meets H.265 coded MKV files, then [VLC can't play MKV](https://tools.techidaily.com/5kplayer/video-music-player/)and often result in MKV player crashes. In solving this problem, the simplest way is to switch VLC Media Player with the best VLC alternative 5KPlayer, but if you a stubborn VLC fan, you might as well try to convert H.265 to H.264, and then you should be able to play MKV files with VLC trouble free. 

![MPC-HC MKV](https://www.5kplayer.com/video-music-player/img/mpc-8k.jpg) 

**No. 3 Media Player Classic -- MKV Video Player for Windows**

Media Player Classic Home Cinema is another most downloaded MKV file player on Windows. But unfortunately the latest Media Player Classic for Windows 10 has troubles to get embedded MKV subtitles to display when viewing MKV files. Not just MKV playback, problems like video no sound, no image and MPC green screen are also constantly happening in playing other media files. Of course, the main cause of these problem is due to the lack of MKV codec of Media Player Classic, you can download and install Media Player Classic codec pack on your computer and probably reinstall MPC again to try to solve these problems.

![GOM Player](https://www.5kplayer.com/video-music-player/img/divxplayer.jpg) 

**No. 5 DivX Player-- Single Featured MKV Player** 

Except using more than 30 minutes to finish the installation, says DivX Player is one of best MKV video player for Windows PC. This is the player with only very basic video playing feature, supports DivX®, AVI, MKV, and HEVC video files up to 4K. DivX Player of course can play MKV video, but if you want to use it to play ACS, dfx and DTS audio files, you need to upgrade it to the pro version by paying $19.99\.

_Question - "Why You Should Download A MKV Player with Native MKV Support?"_

_\- What I can only say is to save you from many troubles：_   
 A native all-round MKV codec support in MKV player can on one hand help avoid downloading tons of old, incomplete, broken, buggy or unstable same third-party MKV codecs or codec packs which might overlap each other and burden your computer. It can on the other hand guarantee no codec pack conflicts be made due to mass MKV codec downloads. An efficient MKV video player always has a well-customized complete pack of MKV decoders and keeps your codecs up-to-date through regular updates and self-detections. 5KPlayer generally covers all MKV codecs including the latest VP8 VP9 codecs usually contained in MKV and WebM for UHD videos online streaming. 

MKV is gaining its leading momentum in terms of storing unlimited video audios with excellent quality yet requiring relatively low storage space and highly efficient in bandwidth usage. If your player does not support MKV format and relevant codecs, it's time to consider replacing it by downloading the best free MKV player below:

### Wiki - What Is MKV?

To find a suitable MKV player, you may need learning some basis of this format: \*.mkv is a filename extension for the Matroska multimedia container format. It is an open standard, future-oriented video file format that is getting more and more popular for high definition videos on the internet, and Matroska has also become a universal format to store high-def multimedia content, such as HD movies and TV shows, attributing to its capability of encapsulating various video, audio, images, subtitle tracks and more into a single file, thus generating MKV files, MKA, MKS, MK3D files respectively and at the same time requiring professional MKV media player to play successfully.

 However, most Windows and Android devices don't natively support MKV files, even some big name media players like VLC Media Player fails thereon, and Windows Media Player can't play MKV video without [MKV Codec for WMP](https://tools.techidaily.com/5kplayer/video-music-player/). Therefore, if you want to play MKV files successfully without messing up with tedious codecs, you need to install a third-party MKV file player. That being said, a free MKV video player named 5KPlayer could be a much-beloved one and can satisfy your demand.

5KPlayer is an emerging multi-purpose free MKV video player specially designed to free play MKV files and other mainstream video formats like AVI MP4 WMV AVCHD MOV. If your favorite video streaming platforms dish out their HD content in Matroska, you won't go wrong with 5KPlayer, which also plays 8K 4K UHD files and MP3 AAC music. Thanks to its straightforward user interface, users of all experience levels can play MKV files easily without headache. You can operate the MKV player with facility no matter you are a newbie or are experienced.

## Why 5KPlayer Is the Best Free MKV Player Windows 10/8/7?

![](https://www.5kplayer.com/video-music-player/../software/image-style/update-history/icon03.png)Codec range matters a lot, and for 5KPlayer with ample muscle in it, it easily oversteps its foregoers way ahead.
