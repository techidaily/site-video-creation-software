Besides adding an artistic touch to portraits you take, cartooning a photo can also be a great way to have fun with your friends because the results of picture cartooning can be as entertaining as visually striking.</p><p>Besides portraiture, this visual effect can be applied to virtually any other genre of photography, although the contents of the shoot usually determine how well the effect is going to work. What’s more, you don’t need a <a class="link"   href="https://tools.techidaily.com/wondershare/filmora/download/" >professional video editing software <i class="fa-regular fa-arrow-up-right-from-square fa-sm"></i></a> to cartoon a photo, since there are so many websites that let you apply this effect to your photos for free.</p><p>That’s why we selected some of the best websites for converting a photo into a cartoon.</p><h2 id="10-Best-Online-Cartoon-Photo-Makers"><a href="#10-Best-Online-Cartoon-Photo-Makers" class="headerlink" title="10+ Best Online Cartoon Photo Makers"></a>10+ Best Online Cartoon Photo Makers</h2><p><a class="link"   href="https://tools.techidaily.com/wondershare/filmora/download/" >Making cartoons <i class="fa-regular fa-arrow-up-right-from-square fa-sm"></i></a> out of photos doesn’t have to be a difficult task that takes a lot of effort to complete. In fact, online cartoon photo makers are easy to use and they don’t require you to have a lot of photo editing experience.</p><p>We’ve selected some of the <a class="link"   href="https://tools.techidaily.com/wondershare/filmora/download/" >best online photo editors <i class="fa-regular fa-arrow-up-right-from-square fa-sm"></i></a> and photo converters that enable you to cartoon your photos in just a few clicks.</p><h3 id="Part-1-Best-Free-Online-Cartoon-Photo-Editors"><a href="#Part-1-Best-Free-Online-Cartoon-Photo-Editors" class="headerlink" title="Part 1: Best Free Online Cartoon Photo Editors"></a>Part 1: Best Free Online Cartoon Photo Editors</h3><p>You don’t have to purchase an expensive photo editing software if you want to cartoon your photos because there are so many different online photo editing platforms that allow you to apply this effect to your photos for free. Let’s take a closer look at what they have to offer.</p><h4 id="2-BeFunky"><a href="#2-BeFunky" class="headerlink" title="2. BeFunky"></a>2. BeFunky</h4><p>Befunky is one of the best photo editors you can find online, which is why it is hardly surprising that it offers cartoonization effects. In fact, you can choose from <strong>five different cartoonization effects</strong> that are all equally impressive.</p><p>All of the cartoon effects Befunky has to offer are located in the Artsy menu, and you just have to click on Cartoonizer DLX, Cross Hatch DLX, Pop Art DLX, or Graphic Novel DLX effects in order to apply them to your photo. Furthermore, you can use the Erase mode if you don’t want to catoonize the entire photo or head over to the Adjust menu to specify the amount of the effect you’ll apply and increase or decrease the photo’s sharpness.</p><p>Go to <a class="link"   href="https://www.befunky.com/features/photo-to-cartoon/" >https://www.befunky.com/features/photo-to-cartoon/ <i class="fa-regular fa-arrow-up-right-from-square fa-sm"></i></a> and you can then turn your photos to cartoon easily in BeFunky.</p><h4 id="3-Lunapic"><a href="#3-Lunapic" class="headerlink" title="3. Lunapic"></a>3. Lunapic</h4><p>This is yet another online photo editing platform that gives you access to a broad range of photo editing options for free. Even though a bit outdated, the Lunapic’s interface resembles Photoshop’s interface, so you won’t need much time to get used to it if you ever used Adobe’s iconic photo editing software.</p><p>Once you’ve uploaded a photo, you just have to go to the Effects menu and select the Cartoon option. Lunapic will then automatically apply the effect to the photo you uploaded and you just need to preview the image before you save it. The only downside is that you can’t adjust the effect’s settings in case you don’t like the results.</p><p>If you want to add cartoon effect to photo with this photo editor, you can go to <a class="link"   href="https://www12.lunapic.com/editor/?action=cartoon" >https://www12.lunapic.com/editor/?action=cartoon <i class="fa-regular fa-arrow-up-right-from-square fa-sm"></i></a>.</p><h4 id="4-wish2be-cartoon-photo-editor"><a href="#4-wish2be-cartoon-photo-editor" class="headerlink" title="4. wish2be cartoon photo editor"></a>4. wish2be cartoon photo editor</h4><p>If you would like to <a class="link"   href="https://tools.techidaily.com/wondershare/filmora/download/" >turn yourself or your friends into a cartoon character <i class="fa-regular fa-arrow-up-right-from-square fa-sm"></i></a>, Wish2Be cartoon photo editor can be a fun option.

Once you are done, you can proceed to upload a photo of the person you want to turn into a cartoon character. Optionally, you can add a text layer and adjust its position and size within the picture. If you like the caricature you created, you can buy a print or you can choose to share your design for free. The Pro Cartoonizer feature this platform offers is only available if you purchase one of the available subscription plans.</p><p>Here is the website <a class="link"   href="https://www.wish2be.com/app/cartoon-photo-editor/" >https://www.wish2be.com/app/cartoon-photo-editor/ <i class="fa-regular fa-arrow-up-right-from-square fa-sm"></i></a> for cartoon photos with Wish2Be.</p><h4 id="5-SnapsTouch"><a href="#5-SnapsTouch" class="headerlink" title="5. SnapsTouch"></a>5. SnapsTouch</h4><p>This is a simple online photo editor that lets you turn your photos into sketches, paintings, or drawings. Choosing the Painting option is probably the easiest way to turn a photo into a cartoon, although this effect can also be achieved with the Pencil Sketch feature.</p><p>After you upload a photo you want to turn into a cartoon, you can choose between Painting 1 and Painting 2 options in order to determine the style of the cartoon you’re creating. In addition, you can decide if you want to include the outline in the painting as well as set the size of the brush and how many levels the final image should have.

There are a lot of different options for editing these files but they cost money. Depending on your situation though, you may be able to edit your files with a program that is free and easy to use.</p><ul><li><a href="#consideration">Things to Consider When Editing Your GoPro HD Videos</a></li><li><a href="#choosing">Choosing the Right Software Package for Your Go Pro project</a></li></ul><h2 id="Things-to-Consider-When-Editing-Your-GoPro-HD-Videos"><a href="#Things-to-Consider-When-Editing-Your-GoPro-HD-Videos" class="headerlink" title="Things to Consider When Editing Your GoPro HD Videos"></a>Things to Consider When Editing Your GoPro HD Videos</h2><p>If you are thinking about using one of the free GoPro HD video editors, you should take the following points into consideration.</p><h4 id="1-All-videos-shot-with-GoPro-HD-will-be-in-an-MP4-format"><a href="#1-All-videos-shot-with-GoPro-HD-will-be-in-an-MP4-format" class="headerlink" title="1. All videos shot with GoPro HD will be in an MP4 format"></a>1. All videos shot with GoPro HD will be in an MP4 format</h4><p>This means you will need to find software that is will be able to import these kinds of files. Make sure you look up the specifications for all of the programs you consider to make sure the one you pick can handle the GoPro format.</p><h4 id="2-Consider-what-kind-of-editing-you-are-going-to-do-with-the-file"><a href="#2-Consider-what-kind-of-editing-you-are-going-to-do-with-the-file" class="headerlink" title="2. Consider what kind of editing you are going to do with the file"></a>2. Consider what kind of editing you are going to do with the file</h4><p>Most free programs make it really easy to do basic editing, but you are going to need to pay for a program if you want to do any heavy duty editing. Make sure you carefully read the features before you download it to make sure you have what you are need to complete your editing. Also, some programs are only free for personal use, so if you need a program for business purposes you are probably going to have to pay a fee.</p><h4 id="3-Consider-the-output-formats"><a href="#3-Consider-the-output-formats" class="headerlink" title="3. Consider the output formats"></a>3. Consider the output formats</h4><p>You will need to check out the different output formats that are available with the free software. If you plan to share the video over social media, make sure that the editing software includes that as an option. If you would like to burn the video to a DVD, make sure that the program is capable of writing to a disc.</p><h2 id="Choosing-the-Right-Software-Package-for-Your-GoPro-Project"><a href="#Choosing-the-Right-Software-Package-for-Your-GoPro-Project" class="headerlink" title="Choosing the Right Software Package for Your GoPro Project"></a>Choosing the Right Software Package for Your GoPro Project</h2><p>Once you are through considering these different points, you can start looking at the different free and easy editing software available. Here are a few suggestions based on how much editing you want to do.</p><h4 id="1-Just-the-Basics"><a href="#1-Just-the-Basics" class="headerlink" title="1 Just the Basics"></a>1 <em>Just the Basics</em></h4><p>There are more options available if you only need to do basic editing, like cutting the length of the video, joining different parts together, or adding music. The following are three of the best programs to handle basic video editing of MP4 files.</p><ul><li><strong>Windows Movie Maker</strong> is a basic Windows program that makes it really easy to manage basic editing, like adding music to one of your favorite videos.</li><li><strong>VLC Media Player</strong> is a neat little open-source program that works across different platforms for very basic use.</li><li><strong>Animoto</strong> is great for joining together several different videos, although only the Lite account is free and has a number of restrictions.</li></ul><h4 id="2-A-Robust-Program"><a href="#2-A-Robust-Program" class="headerlink" title="2 A Robust Program"></a>2 <em>A Robust Program</em></h4><p>If you want something robust and effective, the best option is Wondershare Filmora. It lets you do more than just basic editing, allowing you to work with a number of different video formats. Once you download it, you will find that it is very user-friendly from the onset. Best of all, you can share videos from the program, something that the basic editors won’t let you do without paying for that ability.</p><p><a href="https://tools.techidaily.com/wondershare/filmora/download/"><img                       lazyload                     src="/images/loading.svg"                     data-src="https://images.wondershare.com/filmora/guide/download-btn-win.jpg"                      alt="Download Win Version"                ></a><a href="https://tools.techidaily.com/wondershare/filmora/download/"><img                       lazyload                     src="/images/loading.svg"                     data-src="https://images.wondershare.com/filmora/guide/download-btn-mac.jpg"                      alt="Download Mac Version"                ></a></p><p><strong>Magix Movie Edit Pro 2015 Plus</strong> excels in areas of advanced features, formats supported and attractive interface. However, it loses points for slow rendering performance and some complexity in the interface. The low price makes the exchange worth it for many users.</p><h2 id="Conclusion"><a href="#Conclusion" class="headerlink" title="Conclusion"></a>Conclusion</h2><p>GoPro HD videos are an incredibly popular format, but it is a bit more of a challenge to find a free editing program that will work with these files. Many free or lite versions of packages let you do very basic editing, but they come with a lot of restrictions and want you to spend money to upgrade it. If you want something that’s easy to use and performs well, Wondershare Filmora is an ideal choice.</p><p><a href="https://tools.techidaily.com/wondershare/filmora/download/"><img

We all work a little differently, and thankfully Adobe understands that, so although here we will be concentrating on the standard keyboard layout, the keyboard shortcuts can be customized to be anything you want and saved as a custom profile, there are even presets already included for Avid Media Composer and <a class="link"   href="https://tools.techidaily.com/wondershare/filmora/download/" >Final Cut Pro <i class="fa-regular fa-arrow-up-right-from-square fa-sm"></i></a> for those who are maybe transitioning from those packages or just prefer the way they work.</p><hr><p> This is a basic tutorial about Adobe Premiere, professional video editing software.

Download the free trial version below.</p><p><a href="https://tools.techidaily.com/wondershare/filmora/download/"><img                       lazyload                     src="/images/loading.svg"                     data-src="https://images.wondershare.com/filmora/guide/download-btn-win.jpg"                      alt="Download Win Version"                ></a><a class="link"   href="https://images.wondershare.com/filmora/guide/download-btn-mac.jpg" >Download Mac Version <i class="fa-regular fa-arrow-up-right-from-square fa-sm"></i></a>](<a class="link"   href="https://tools.techidaily.com/wondershare/filmora/download/" >https://tools.techidaily.com/wondershare/filmora/download/ <i class="fa-regular fa-arrow-up-right-from-square fa-sm"></i></a>)</p><hr><p> This is achieved by going through the path edit &gt; keyboard shortcuts as below:</p><p><img                       lazyload                     src="/images/loading.svg"                     data-src="https://images.wondershare.com/images/multimedia/video-editor/adobe-shortcut-1.jpg"                      alt="Adobe Premiere Shortcut"                ></p><p> Before we step into the most useful shortcuts, a brief note here on the different platforms, although I’m sure most readers are aware. The PC and Mac versions of the software do share the same basic shortcuts with the one caveat that where the PC uses the Control and Alt keys, the Mac has Command and Option keys instead. Other than that the functionality is the same. I’ll include the shortcuts for both platforms with each to make referencing easier.</p><h4 id="1Select-Window"><a href="#1Select-Window" class="headerlink" title="1Select Window"></a>1Select Window</h4><p> I’m starting with this one simply because I find it the most used of all, especially if like me you prefer a custom layout for all your windows. If your program monitor is hidden for instance, you can just press shift+4 and there it is. The shortcuts are the same for both platforms here.</p><ul><li>Audio Clip Mixer Shift+9</li><li>Audio Track Mixer Shift+6</li><li>Effect Controls Shift+5</li><li>Effects Shift+7</li><li>Media Browser Shift+8</li><li>Program Monitor Shift+4</li><li>Project Shift+1</li><li>Source Monitor Shift+2</li><li>Timelines Shift+3</li></ul><h4 id="2-Import"><a href="#2-Import" class="headerlink" title="2 Import"></a>2 Import</h4><p> Whilst the shortcuts for editing and manipulating clips are extremely important for efficient workflow, it should be remembered that those relating to the basic operation of the program are just as useful, as we see here. Using Control and I (Command and I on Mac) brings up the import media dialogue box instantly.</p><p><img                       lazyload                     src="/images/loading.svg"                     data-src="https://images.wondershare.com/images/multimedia/video-editor/adobe-shotcut-3.png"                      alt="Adobe Premiere Shortcut"                ></p><h4 id="3Capture-Panel"><a href="#3Capture-Panel" class="headerlink" title="3Capture Panel"></a>3Capture Panel</h4><p> There are multiple shortcuts that can be used within the capture panel, but because this is such an intrinsic aspect of the Premiere workflow, being the entry into a project for all media, I think the available shortcuts are all as valuable as each other here.</p><ul><li>Navigate Through Fields - Tab</li><li>Cancel Capture - Esc</li><li>Fast Forward - F</li><li>Rewind - R</li><li>Go to In Point - Q</li><li>Go to Out Point - W</li><li>Record - G</li><li>Stop - S</li><li>Step Back - Left Arrow</li><li>Step Forward - Right Arrow</li></ul><p><img                       lazyload                     src="/images/loading.svg"                     data-src="https://images.wondershare.com/images/multimedia/video-editor/adobe-shotcut-2.jpg"                      alt="Adobe Premiere Shortcut"                ></p><h4 id="4-Timeline-Panel"><a href="#4-Timeline-Panel" class="headerlink" title="4 Timeline Panel"></a>4 Timeline Panel</h4><p> In a similar vein to the Capture Panel, the Timeline Panel has a set of shortcuts specific to all its basic operations, and are essential for a faster workflow.</p><ul><li>Clear Ins and Outs - G</li><li>Clear In Point - D</li><li>Clear Out Point - F</li><li>Go to In Point- Q</li><li>Go to Out Point - W</li><li>Match Frame - M</li><li>Start and Stop - Spacebar</li><li>Play Normal Speed - L</li><li>Play Reverse Normal Speed - J</li><li>Set In Point - I</li><li>Set Out Point - o</li><li>Shuttle Stop - K</li><li>Trim - T</li><li>Arc Tool - A</li><li>Ellipse Tool – E</li></ul><p><img                       lazyload                     src="/images/loading.svg"                     data-src="https://images.wondershare.com/images/multimedia/video-editor/adobe-shotcut-4.jpg"                      alt="Adobe Premiere Shortcut"                ></p><h4 id="5-Navigation-within-a-clip"><a href="#5-Navigation-within-a-clip" class="headerlink" title="5 Navigation within a clip"></a>5 Navigation within a clip</h4><p> This one works within the program monitor&#x2F;timeline or source monitor windows, ensure the desired one is active first of course. You can move to a specific time code within the clip, or go forwards or backwards a set number of frames using the number pad. To go to a specific time code simply type that on the number pad. To travel a set number of frames simply type + or – (to signify direction) and the number of frames.</p><h4 id="6Marking-Clips"><a href="#6Marking-Clips" class="headerlink" title="6Marking Clips"></a>6Marking Clips</h4><p> By far the simplest way to mark clips is to use the keyboard shortcut.</p><p> For marking clips use X , whilst marking a selection is &#x2F; .</p><h4 id="7-In-and-Out"><a href="#7-In-and-Out" class="headerlink" title="7 In and Out"></a>7 In and Out</h4><p> In addition to marking clips via shortcuts, it is also far easier to mark In and Out points this way.</p><ul><li>To Mark In use I , whilst to mark Out use O .</li><li>To Clear In the shortcut is Control+Shift+I for PC and Option+I for Mac.</li><li>To Clear Out Control+Shift+O for PC, Option+O for Mac.</li></ul><h4 id="8Playing-Clips"><a href="#8Playing-Clips" class="headerlink" title="8Playing Clips"></a>8Playing Clips</h4><p> Going hand in hand with the shortcuts for marking, are the keyboard commands for playing clips. These are:</p><ul><li>Play In to Out: Control+Shift+Space (PC) and Option+K for Mac</li><li>Clear In and Out: Control+Shift+X (PC) and Option+X for Mac</li><li>Play Around: The same for both platforms and is Shift+K.</li></ul><p> To get the best from this it is necessary to set some options beforehand, as Play Around plays the portion of the timeline around the Playhead, and where it plays is dependent on the options set. This is done through the menu via edit &gt; preferences &gt; playback, here I have preroll and postroll set to 4 seconds, meaning that it plays 4 seconds prior and following the point where the playhead is placed.</p><p><img                       lazyload                     src="/images/loading.svg"                     data-src="https://images.wondershare.com/images/multimedia/video-editor/adobe-shotcut-5.jpg"                      alt="Adobe Premiere Shortcut"                ></p><p> In addition, turning on looping for this can help to fine tune edits.</p><h4 id="9Toggle-Audio-During-Scrubbing"><a href="#9Toggle-Audio-During-Scrubbing" class="headerlink" title="9Toggle Audio During Scrubbing"></a>9Toggle Audio During Scrubbing</h4><p> There are times you may want to hear audio when scrubbing, however turning it off can have beneficial effects on performance for lower end computers. The shortcut makes it an easy process to turn off and on as required.</p><p> The shortcut is Shift+S for both platforms.</p><h4 id="10Slide-a-clip-within-the-sequence"><a href="#10Slide-a-clip-within-the-sequence" class="headerlink" title="10Slide a clip within the sequence"></a>10Slide a clip within the sequence</h4><p> There are a couple of options available here from the shortcuts, slide one frame or 5 frames.</p><ul><li>To slide one frame to the left is Alt+, for PC or Option+, for Mac. To increase to five frames add Shift to either shortcut.</li><li>To slide one frame to the right is Alt+. for PC and Option+. for Mac. Again, to increase to five frames add Shift.</li></ul><h4 id="11Slip-within-a-sequence"><a href="#11Slip-within-a-sequence" class="headerlink" title="11Slip within a sequence"></a>11Slip within a sequence</h4><p> As with the slide options, the choice is one frame or five frames.</p><ul><li>To slip one frame to the left is Control+Alt+Left for PC or Option+Command+Left for Mac. To increase to five frames add Shift to either shortcut.</li><li>To slip one frame to the right is Control+Alt+Right for PC and Option+Command+Right for Mac. Again, to increase to five frames add Shift.</li></ul><h4 id="12Nudging"><a href="#12Nudging" class="headerlink" title="12Nudging"></a>12Nudging</h4><p> You can move a clip up or down simply by using the Up and Down arrow keys, whilst holding Alt or Option at the same time allows you to select just the video or audio to move.</p><h4 id="13Multi-Camera-Selection"><a href="#13Multi-Camera-Selection" class="headerlink" title="13Multi Camera Selection"></a>13Multi Camera Selection</h4><p> This is a tool that allows you to work with multiple camera angles of the same subject or scene. To switch between different cameras quickly is extremely useful and accomplished with the numerical keys.</p><p> Numbers 1 through 9 select the corresponding camera.</p><h4 id="14Add-an-edit"><a href="#14Add-an-edit" class="headerlink" title="14Add an edit"></a>14Add an edit</h4><p> This option cuts the track (or tracks) that are targeted. The shortcut for this is Control+K or Command+K.</p><p> You can view all added edits within a sequence by selecting show through edits within the sequence menu.</p><p><img                       lazyload                     src="/images/loading.svg"                     data-src="https://images.wondershare.com/images/multimedia/video-editor/adobe-shotcut-6.jpg"                      alt="Adobe Premiere Shortcut"                ></p><h4 id="15Add-the-default-Transition"><a href="#15Add-the-default-Transition" class="headerlink" title="15Add the default Transition"></a>15Add the default Transition</h4><p> This option applies the default transition to all selected media. To do this use Shift+D.</p><h4 id="16-Match-Frame"><a href="#16-Match-Frame" class="headerlink" title="16 Match Frame"></a>16 Match Frame</h4><p> Locating a specific frame within the sequence for adding in a second clip is very useful, the shortcut is M, a great timesaver.</p><h4 id="17Zoom-to-sequence"><a href="#17Zoom-to-sequence" class="headerlink" title="17Zoom to sequence"></a>17Zoom to sequence</h4><p> Being able to zoom in is great, it makes working in the sequence panel much easier, at least for me, however the one drawback I find is that I tend to get lost when looking for a particular clip. Using &#x2F; enable you to quickly zoom out for navigation and back in again to work</p><h4 id="18Jump-to-Edit"><a href="#18Jump-to-Edit" class="headerlink" title="18Jump to Edit"></a>18Jump to Edit</h4><p> Navigating from edit to edit is a very simple process with the shortcuts available to you.</p><p> Page up takes you to the previous edit point, whilst page down takes you to the next.</p><p> With practice these shortcuts become second nature and you will find your workflow becomes not only faster but a smoother operation as well.</p><h4 id="19Toggle-the-type-of-Trim-used"><a href="#19Toggle-the-type-of-Trim-used" class="headerlink" title="19Toggle the type of Trim used"></a>19Toggle the type of Trim used</h4><p> Quickly shift between Standard, Ripple and Roll trim types.</p><p> Shift+T for PC, Control+T for Mac</p><h4 id="20Ripple-Trim"><a href="#20Ripple-Trim" class="headerlink" title="20Ripple Trim"></a>20Ripple Trim</h4><p> This enables you to trim the head or tail of the clip very quickly, making an extremely efficient workflow. To trim the next edit from the Playhead use W, for the previous edit from the playhead use Q.</p><p><img                       lazyload                     src="/images/loading.svg"                     data-src="https://images.wondershare.com/filmora/article-images/benjamin-arango-author.jpg"                      alt="author avatar"                ></p><p>Benjamin Arango</p><p>Benjamin Arango is a writer and a lover of all things video.</p><p>Follow @Benjamin Arango</p><p><span class="atpl-alsoreadstyle">Also read:</span></p><div><ul><li><a href="https://video-creation-software.techidaily.com/2024-approved-macos-video-editing-made-easy-introducing-ezvid-slideshow-software/"><u>2024 Approved MacOS Video Editing Made Easy Introducing Ezvid Slideshow Software</u></a></li><li><a href="https://video-creation-software.techidaily.com/updated-edit-videos-on-mac-vn-video-editor-and-beyond-for-2024/"><u>Updated Edit Videos on Mac VN Video Editor and Beyond for 2024</u></a></li><li><a href="https://video-creation-software.techidaily.com/2024-approved-say-goodbye-to-movie-maker-10-free-video-editing-option/"><u>2024 Approved Say Goodbye to Movie Maker 10 Free Video Editing Option</u></a></li><li><a href="https://video-creation-software.techidaily.com/new-2024-approved-10-best-free-video-upload-sites-for-online-presence-and-visibility/"><u>New 2024 Approved 10 Best Free Video Upload Sites for Online Presence and Visibility</u></a></li><li><a href="https://video-creation-software.techidaily.com/updated-2024-approved-the-top-5-free-m4a-file-editors-you-need/"><u>Updated 2024 Approved The Top 5 Free M4A File Editors You Need</u></a></li><li><a href="https://video-creation-software.techidaily.com/new-in-2024-a-beginners-guide-to-trimming-videos-using-kapwings-online-editor/"><u>New In 2024, A Beginners Guide to Trimming Videos Using Kapwings Online Editor</u></a></li><li><a href="https://video-creation-software.techidaily.com/the-ultimate-list-10-best-video-players-for-slow-motion-for-2024/"><u>The Ultimate List 10 Best Video Players for Slow Motion for 2024</u></a></li><li><a href="https://video-creation-software.techidaily.com/updated-professional-grade-glitch-video-editors-top-paid-and-free-tools-for-windows-mac-and-online/"><u>Updated Professional-Grade Glitch Video Editors Top Paid and Free Tools for Windows, Mac, and Online</u></a></li><li><a href="https://some-techniques.techidaily.com/2024-approved-expertise-in-mobile-lut-apps/"><u>2024 Approved  Expertise in Mobile LUT Apps</u></a></li><li><a href="https://change-location.techidaily.com/pokemon-go-cooldown-chart-on-samsung-galaxy-a05-drfone-by-drfone-virtual-android/"><u>Pokémon Go Cooldown Chart On Samsung Galaxy A05 | Dr.fone</u></a></li><li><a href="https://facebook-video-content.techidaily.com/new-essential-guide-to-leveraging-videos-in-social-media-ads-for-2024/"><u>[New] Essential Guide to Leveraging Videos in Social Media Ads for 2024</u></a></li><li><a href="https://remote-screen-capture.techidaily.com/new-ultimate-simplicity-guide-to-iphone-screen-recordings-for-2024/"><u>[New] Ultimate Simplicity Guide to iPhone Screen Recordings for 2024</u></a></li><li><a href="https://facebook-videos.techidaily.com/adaptive-strategies-for-successful-content-on-new-fb-algorithm-for-2024/"><u>Adaptive Strategies for Successful Content on New FB Algorithm for 2024</u></a></li><li><a href="https://youtube-clips.techidaily.com/new-1-5-best-url-trimmer-tools-for-youtube-videos/"><u>[New] 1-5 Best URL Trimmer Tools for YouTube Videos</u></a></li><li><a href="https://extra-skills.techidaily.com/kinemaster-tutorial-for-epic-memes-for-2024/"><u>KineMaster Tutorial for Epic Memes for 2024</u></a></li><li><a href="https://facebook-record-videos.techidaily.com/new-navigating-multi-platform-engagement-for-content-creators/"><u>[New] Navigating Multi-Platform Engagement for Content Creators</u></a></li><li><a href="https://android-pokemon-go.techidaily.com/in-2024-where-is-the-best-place-to-catch-dratini-on-oppo-find-x7-drfone-by-drfone-virtual-android/"><u>In 2024, Where Is the Best Place to Catch Dratini On Oppo Find X7 | Dr.fone</u></a></li></ul></div><p><ins class="adsbygoogle"      style="display:block"      data-ad-client="ca-pub-7571918770474297"      data-ad-slot="8358498916"      data-ad-format="auto"      data-full-width-responsive="true"></ins></p>]]></content>

Only a few decades ago this animation technique was used solely by movie industry professionals, but today you no longer have to be a seasoned animator in order to create stop motion video.</p><p>In fact, you don’t even need desktop-based <a class="link"   href="https://tools.techidaily.com/wondershare/filmora/download/" >video editing software <i class="fa-regular fa-arrow-up-right-from-square fa-sm"></i></a>, because there are so many different web-based video editing platforms that offer all the tools you need to make a captivating stop motion video.

Consequently, an outdoor scene looks differently throughout different parts of the day, which makes it impossible to capture the full extent of its beauty by snapping a single photo or recording a short video of it.</p><p>That is why you must utilize the <strong>time-lapse technique</strong> to depict the passage of time at a particular shooting location and create a sequence in your video that suggests that a certain amount of time has passed by. So in this article, we will take you through some of the <strong>best time-lapse video editing software</strong> you can find on the market in 2024.</p><h2 id="Best-Time-Lapse-Video-Post-Production-Software-in-2024"><a href="#Best-Time-Lapse-Video-Post-Production-Software-in-2024" class="headerlink" title="Best Time-Lapse Video Post-Production Software in 2024"></a>Best Time-Lapse Video Post-Production Software in 2024</h2><p>There are two different recording methods you can use to create time-lapse videos. You can either <strong>record videos or take photos at a precisely set interval</strong>, but regardless of the approach you choose, you must have the right equipment for the job.</p><p>This means that you must have a time-lapse tripod that ensures the smooth movement of your camera, an intervalometer, and a camera setup capable of taking pictures or recording videos over an extended period of time.</p><p>Most importantly, you must have access to a <a class="link"   href="https://tools.techidaily.com/wondershare/filmora/download/" >video editor <i class="fa-regular fa-arrow-up-right-from-square fa-sm"></i></a> that enables you to process the footage and control its playback rate. Let’s take a look at the best post-production software products that allow its users to create stunning time-lapses video.</p><h4 id="1-Filmora"><a href="#1-Filmora" class="headerlink" title="1.

If you decide to make a time-lapse out of still images, you must ensure that you have enough footage since the video you’re producing must have 24 or 30 frames per second. That’s why you need <strong>30 or 24 photos</strong> for each second of your time-lapse video, and you must arrange all of these images on the editor’s timeline before you begin adjusting their duration.</p><p><img                       lazyload                     src="/images/loading.svg"                     data-src="https://images.wondershare.com/filmora/article-images/make-timelapse-video-from-photos-in-filmora-1.jpg"                      alt="Filmora Timelapse video making"                ></p><p>Select all timeline photos placed in the timeline panel, right-click to access the   <strong>Duration setting</strong>, and then <strong>set the input duration of each picture to 0.01 seconds</strong>.</p><p>Click OK to continue, and you’ll find that the duration of all timelapse photos has changed to a brief second. Click the playback button in the Preview window, and you’ll see the time-lapse video is made already.</p><p><img                       lazyload                     src="/images/loading.svg"                     data-src="https://images.wondershare.com/filmora/article-images/filmora-make-timelapse-video-with-photos-1.jpg"                      alt="made  Timelapse video with Filmora"                ></p><p><a href="https://tools.techidaily.com/wondershare/filmora/download/"><img                       lazyload                     src="/images/loading.svg"                     data-src="https://images.wondershare.com/filmora/guide/download-btn-win.jpg"                      alt="Download Win Version"                ></a><a href="https://tools.techidaily.com/wondershare/filmora/download/"><img                       lazyload                     src="/images/loading.svg"                     data-src="https://images.wondershare.com/filmora/guide/download-btn-mac.jpg"                      alt="Download Mac Version"                ></a></p><p>If you are working with video files, you should <strong>double the playback rate</strong> to create the time-lapse effect. The results you will get largely depend on the quality of the footage you’ve recorded. You must do everything in your power to capture the photos or videos properly before you start the video editing process.</p><p>You can check the details about two ways of <a class="link"   href="https://tools.techidaily.com/wondershare/filmora/download/" >making a time-lapse video in Filmora <i class="fa-regular fa-arrow-up-right-from-square fa-sm"></i></a> here.</p><h4 id="2-iMovie"><a href="#2-iMovie" class="headerlink" title="2. iMovie"></a>2. iMovie</h4><p><strong>Price:</strong>  Free</p><p><strong>Compatibility:</strong>  macOS and iOS</p><p>iMovie may not be the most advanced video editing software for Mac computers, but that doesn’t mean that you can’t use iMovie to create time-lapse videos. In fact, all you have to do to make a time-lapse video with this software is to arrange the photos on the editor’s timeline and change their duration to <strong>0.1</strong> seconds from the <strong>Clip Information panel</strong>.</p><p>However, if you do this, your time-lapse video will play only <strong>10 frames per second</strong>, so to <a class="link"   href="https://tools.techidaily.com/wondershare/filmora/download/" >speed it up <i class="fa-regular fa-arrow-up-right-from-square fa-sm"></i></a>, you first have to export the video you’ve created in this manner and then import it back into iMovie.</p><p>Afterward, you can select the <strong>Custom option</strong> from the <strong>Speed menu</strong> that lets you select the playback speed of a video clip. Making a time-lapse video in iMovie is a slow process that requires a lot of patience, especially if you are working with a large number of photos or video clips.</p><p>If you want to edit videos further with iMovie, here is a brief tutorial about <a class="link"   href="https://tools.techidaily.com/wondershare/filmora/download/" >How to Use iMovie to Edit Videos <i class="fa-regular fa-arrow-up-right-from-square fa-sm"></i></a>.</p><h4 id="3-VirtualDub"><a href="#3-VirtualDub" class="headerlink" title="3.

VirtualDub</h4><p><strong>Price:</strong>  Free</p><p><strong>Compatibility:</strong>  Windows</p><p>This open-source video editor is commonly used for batch-processing of <strong>AVI video files</strong> and sets of <strong>BMP image files</strong>. Even though VirtualDub doesn’t offer a lot of video editing tools, its batch-processing capabilities make it a perfect choice for all PC users who want to create time-lapse videos.</p><p>Nonetheless, the process of making a time-lapse in VirtualDub is highly technical as you’ll need to make sure that all the images you want to use in the video are the <strong>same size</strong>. Besides, you’ll have to set up the <strong>video’s <a class="link"   href="https://tools.techidaily.com/wondershare/filmora/download/" >frame rate <i class="fa-regular fa-arrow-up-right-from-square fa-sm"></i></a>, <a class="link"   href="https://tools.techidaily.com/wondershare/filmora/download/" >aspect ratio <i class="fa-regular fa-arrow-up-right-from-square fa-sm"></i></a>, and compression manually</strong>, before you can apply it to all files you imported into the video editor. That’s why you first need to familiarize yourself with VirtualDub and then start using it to make time-lapse videos.</p><h4 id="4-GoPro-Quik"><a href="#4-GoPro-Quik" class="headerlink" title="4. GoPro Quik"></a>4. GoPro Quik</h4><p><strong>Price:</strong>  Free</p><p><strong>Compatibility:</strong>  macOS, Windows</p><p>GoPro cameras offer a plethora of ways to capture the footage you can later turn into time-lapse videos. Besides a GoPro camera, you will also need additional equipment like <strong>rotating camera mounts, extra batteries, or several memory cards</strong> to record the time-lapse footage properly.</p><p>GoPro’s Quik video editor features all the tools you’re going to need to organize large quantities of video and photo files and create time-lapse videos. The software also enables you to add <strong>panning effects</strong> to your time-lapses that simulate the camera movement. However, GoPro Quik is a good choice only for filmmakers and video content creators who record most of their footage with different models of GoPro cameras.</p><h4 id="5-Final-Cut-Pro-X"><a href="#5-Final-Cut-Pro-X" class="headerlink" title="5. Final Cut Pro X"></a>5. Final Cut Pro X</h4><p><strong>Price:</strong>  $299.99</p><p><strong>Compatibility:</strong>  macOS</p><p>Controlling the playback speed of the files you import into a project in FCPX is simple, since you just have to place the photos or videos on the timeline and select them. Afterward, you should head over to the <strong>Retime</strong> submenu that is located in the <strong>Modify drop-down menu</strong> and select one of the <strong>Custom Speed, Blade Speed or Fast</strong> options.</p><p>You will have to tweak the particular settings depending on the option you select, but your main goal should be to speed up the footage just enough to suggest the rapid passage of time. Try out different values to find the playback speed that is best suited for the time-lapse video you’re working on.</p><p>Learn more details about <a class="link"   href="https://tools.techidaily.com/wondershare/filmora/download/" >Making a Time Lapse Video in Final Cut Pro <i class="fa-regular fa-arrow-up-right-from-square fa-sm"></i></a>.</p><h4 id="6-Adobe-Premiere-Pro"><a href="#6-Adobe-Premiere-Pro" class="headerlink" title="6.

Adobe Premiere Pro</h4><p><strong>Price:</strong>  $20.99 per month as a single app</p><p><strong>Compatibility:</strong>  Windows, macOS</p><p>The way you capture your photos and organize them is crucial in creating a time-lapse video in Adobe Premiere Pro. You must <strong>arrange all the photos numerically</strong>, and once you’re ready to import them into the software, you must make sure that the <strong>Image Sequence checkbox</strong> is selected. Adobe Premiere Pro will automatically generate a video from the photos so you can add a video file to the timeline instead of hundreds of still images. This professional video editing software provides with a broad range of video editing tools you can use to <strong>simulate camera movement, perform color correction or control the video’s playback speed</strong>.

Fast movements, backlight, and multi-person portraits influence the output of the AI portrait. However, you need to purchase this feature to add it to the Wondershare Filmora.</p><p><img                       lazyload                     src="/images/loading.svg"                     data-src="https://images.wondershare.com/filmora/article-images/add-new-video-background.jpg"                      alt="Filmora remove and change video background"                ></p><h3 id="2-Auto-Reframe"><a href="#2-Auto-Reframe" class="headerlink" title="2.

It allows you to adjust the video’s speed (i.e., Auto, Slow, or Fast). You can also preview the video in real-time while reframing it.</p><p>For auto reframing the video, you need to import the media and then select auto-reframe from the Tools. After selecting the aspect ratio and adjusting the speed, analyze the video and export it in the required format.</p><p><img                       lazyload                     src="/images/loading.svg"                     data-src="https://images.wondershare.com/filmora/article-images/filmora-auto-reframe-feature.jpg"                      alt="Filmora auto reframe feature"                ></p><h3 id="3-AR-Stickers"><a href="#3-AR-Stickers" class="headerlink" title="3.  AR Stickers"></a>3.  AR Stickers</h3><p>Wondershare Filmora features a wide collection of AR stickers that you can use to emphasize reactions, enhance emotions, and add personality to the video. The face-tracking stickers are image-based filters with fun and attractive elements such as bears, koalas, pandas, cats, glasses, bunnies, and many more. For instance, applying the AR sticker named Heart eyes will automatically add hearts to the person’s eyes and start moving with them.</p><p>AR stickers work great when tried on an object facing the camera. However, if more than one object is in the frame, the stickers will attach to any face it detects. Moreover, adding AR stickers is no complicated job. You can add them the same way as other filters. You can also delete the applied AR sticker if it looks dull or doesn’t fit with your video by right-clicking on it and then selecting <strong>Delete Effect</strong>. However, by selecting delete effects, you will remove all the applied effects, i.e., other than AR stickers.</p><p><img                       lazyload                     src="/images/loading.svg"                     data-src="https://images.wondershare.com/filmora/article-images/filmora-ar-stickers-effects.jpg"                      alt="Filmora AR Sticker feature"                ></p><p><a href="https://tools.techidaily.com/wondershare/filmora/download/"><img                       lazyload                     src="/images/loading.svg"                     data-src="https://images.wondershare.com/filmora/guide/download-btn-win.jpg"                      alt="Download Win Version"                ></a><a class="link"   href="https://images.wondershare.com/filmora/guide/download-btn-mac.jpg" >Download Mac Version <i class="fa-regular fa-arrow-up-right-from-square fa-sm"></i></a>](<a class="link"   href="https://tools.techidaily.com/wondershare/filmora/download/" >https://tools.techidaily.com/wondershare/filmora/download/ <i class="fa-regular fa-arrow-up-right-from-square fa-sm"></i></a>)</p><p><strong>Conclusion</strong></p><p><strong><a class="link"   href="https://tools.techidaily.com/wondershare/filmora/download/" >Wondershare Filmora Video Editor <i class="fa-regular fa-arrow-up-right-from-square fa-sm"></i></a></strong> is one of the top-rated editing software and is well-known among content creators.

    <content type="html"><![CDATA[<h2 id="DVR-Wars-TiVo-and-Comcast-Go-Head-to-Head"><a href="#DVR-Wars-TiVo-and-Comcast-Go-Head-to-Head" class="headerlink" title="DVR Wars: TiVo and Comcast Go Head-to-Head"></a>DVR Wars: TiVo and Comcast Go Head-to-Head</h2><h1 id="TiVo-vs-Comcast-Who-Wins-the-DVR-Battle"><a href="#TiVo-vs-Comcast-Who-Wins-the-DVR-Battle" class="headerlink" title="TiVo vs Comcast, Who Wins the DVR Battle?"></a>TiVo vs Comcast, Who Wins the DVR Battle?</h1><p><img                       lazyload                     src="/images/loading.svg"                     data-src="https://images.wondershare.com/filmora/article-images/ollie-mattison.jpg"                      alt="author avatar"                ></p><h5 id="Ollie-Mattison"><a href="#Ollie-Mattison" class="headerlink" title="Ollie Mattison"></a>Ollie Mattison</h5><p> Mar 27, 2024• Proven solutions</p><p> Cable, satellite, over the air broadcast, streaming internet video – never before have we had so many choices of how to receive television programming. DVR, PVR, computer hard drive, external storage device; now we have choices in how to store programs for viewing later to consider as well. So what is true and what is hype when it comes to what’s the best device? Let’s peel back the layers and look at the information.</p><p> First, what is a DVR? A DVR, or digital video recorder, is a device that records video from a source for playback at another time. It often comes with a television programming guide included so you can easily locate shows you want to record. Most DVRs come with large capacity hard drives, though some have flash memory cards as their storage medium. There are a variety of types that range from small storage capacity and two tuners, up through several tuners and massive hard drive storage ability. You also can pause and rewind live TV, which is great when you want to create your own sports instant replays. Most DVRs also allow you to watch one program that was previously recorded while two others are recording, though some have greater capacity.</p><p> A TiVo is a particular kind of DVR that was first introduced in 1999. It requires a subscription to its own programming guide that can be purchased month to month, or as a “lifetime” subscription (that means the life of the TiVo, not your life, by the way). TiVos, like cable company DVRs, can record just one show or an entire season. TiVos have a smart feature which notices which shows you are watching and recommends similar ones to you based on how you rate current programs. It also uses these ratings to suggest shows to other viewers.</p><p> Let’s look at a few of the main features of both so you can do a comparison. We’ll look at five factors.</p><h2 id="1-TiVo-vs-Comcast-Cost-and-rent-versus-own"><a href="#1-TiVo-vs-Comcast-Cost-and-rent-versus-own" class="headerlink" title="1. TiVo vs Comcast: Cost and rent versus own"></a>1. TiVo vs Comcast: Cost and rent versus own</h2><p> With a Comcast DVR, you are renting it from the cable company at a cost of $10 to $16 a month, depending on your market. There are no upfront costs, and should the device fail, you can swap it at no cost at your local Comcast service center. Some folks have found that the new X1 boxes are prone to crashes, so that free swap is handy.</p><p> A TiVo is yours to keep as long as it lasts or as long as you want it, whichever comes first. It has an initial cost of between $200 and $600, depending on the model. Plus, you have the subscription cost on top of the unit price, which is $15 a month or $500 for a “lifetime” subscription, which TiVo may or may not give you partial credit for should your device fail and you need a new one. Like the Comcast DVRs, some TiVo boxes are less than stable. It’s the nature of electronics. TiVos also have advertising on them, which some Comcast channels do also, like MusicChoice, but not on all of them.</p><h2 id="2-TiVo-vs-Comcast-Services-available"><a href="#2-TiVo-vs-Comcast-Services-available" class="headerlink" title="2. TiVo vs Comcast: Services available"></a>2. TiVo vs Comcast: Services available</h2><p> With a DVR from Comcast, you can only record shows that are broadcast on one of Comcast’s channels or play shows that are loaded into its On Demand section. A TiVo can be connected to a number of sources, including cable via a cable card, and allow you to combine all of your viewing sources into the one box. It even connects to a high definition antenna.</p><p> The TiVo with cable card has access to all of the cable On Demand services, so in that sense it can replace all of the Comcast DVRs. However, the cable card is not free. It typically runs $1.50 per card per month, up to $2.50 per card on the Frontier system.</p><p> The menus are slightly different, as you can see below.</p><p><img                       lazyload                     src="/images/loading.svg"                     data-src="https://images.wondershare.com/multimedia/tivo-comcast-interface.jpg"                      alt="tivo comcast interface"                ></p><p> Comcast interface</p><p><img                       lazyload                     src="/images/loading.svg"                     data-src="https://images.wondershare.com/multimedia/comcast-menu.jpg"                      alt="comcast-menu"                ></p><p> TiVo interface</p><p> TiVos also recognize SD and HD as just different versions of the same show, instead of different channels like Comcast does, so you can set your DVR to just record HD. This makes it somewhat harder to just record HD on a TiVo.</p><p> Down the road, Comcast is planning the X2 system which would have cloud recording capacity, thus ending the need for a box in your house at all. TiVo has not yet announced such a plan.</p><h2 id="3-TiVo-vs-Comcast-Connection-to-a-network"><a href="#3-TiVo-vs-Comcast-Connection-to-a-network" class="headerlink" title="3. TiVo vs Comcast: Connection to a network"></a>3. TiVo vs Comcast: Connection to a network</h2><p> TiVos can be connected to your home computer network, and the newest one, the Roamio, comes with built-in wifi, for total freedom of use. Because it’s on the network, you can stream shows from your computer through the TiVo box for later playback. It supports channels like Netflix, Hulu Plus, and Amazon Instant. You can also stream shows to your Apple portable devices and then take the shows with you on the plane or to the gym, or use the device as a remote control. (Android devices will have the same capacity soon.) The network capacity also means you can use your computer to control the TiVo box and view content wherever you are.</p><p> Some reviewers have also noted that the network set up is not as simple as it might be, and it requires some computer knowledge and ability. Unless you have a tech person nearby, novice computer users may not wish to set up the network.</p><p> The iPhone app remote screen looks like this:</p><p><img                       lazyload                     src="/images/loading.svg"                     data-src="https://images.wondershare.com/multimedia/iphone-app.jpg"                      alt="iphone app"                ></p><p> A TiVo does have limitations of who can access which channels. For instance, it does not stream HBOGo, nor does it interface with Apple’s TV programming. For that you still need an AppleTV device.</p><p> Comcast boxes simply do not network well. They are designed to broadcast the cable signals through your TV, but not on a home network. They are often easier to connect, however, just requiring a cable from the box to be plugged into the TV.</p><h2 id="4-TiVo-vs-Comcast-Recording-capacity"><a href="#4-TiVo-vs-Comcast-Recording-capacity" class="headerlink" title="4. TiVo vs Comcast: Recording capacity"></a>4. TiVo vs Comcast: Recording capacity</h2><p> The new TiVo, the Roamio, has as many as six tuners that can record at the same time with up to 150 hours of high definition programming. You’ll never have another scheduling conflict again!</p><p> TiVos have recording capacities that range from 75 to 450 hours, depending on whether it is standard definition or high definition, and which device you are using. You can choose from three models of the Roamio. The base model costs $200 and has 75 hours of capacity. The menu and features are more limited on this one than on the others. There is a middle model priced at $400 that has the same six tuners as the high-end one but can only hold 150 hours of recordings. Then the top tier model costs $600 and has 450 hours of recording capacity, all of it in high definition.</p><p> The Comcast X1 DVR has four tuners and it can record them simultaneously. You can watch a prerecorded program while it’s recording, too. It can hold 120 hours of HD or 600 hours of SD programming.</p><h2 id="5-TiVo-vs-Comcast-User-interface"><a href="#5-TiVo-vs-Comcast-User-interface" class="headerlink" title="5. TiVo vs Comcast: User interface"></a>5. TiVo vs Comcast: User interface</h2><p> The Comcast X1 DVR system has a voice-activated interface and a completely different look and layout than their standard system has.</p><p><img                       lazyload                     src="/images/loading.svg"                     data-src="https://images.wondershare.com/multimedia/x1-remoteerer.jpg"                      alt="x1 remoteerer"                ></p><p> The basic Comcast remote is a multi-function remote and capable of controlling all functions, but it does not have the ability to connect to a portable device like a tablet or a smartphone to have connectivity that way like a TiVo can through an app. The remote has to be line of sight in order to work.</p><p><img                       lazyload                     src="/images/loading.svg"                     data-src="https://images.wondershare.com/multimedia/comcast-remotes.jpg"                      alt="comcast remotes"                ></p><p> The TiVo device menu is in standard definition, so for those who have a high definition set up, you may find this a bit distraction or fuzzy. It does come with apps for extending what the box can do, including games for kids.</p><p> Many reviewers liked the interface on the TiVo better than the grid used on the Comcast service. The TiVo programming guide allows you to delete channels you don’t watch so you’re only looking at the channels you like. Comcast’s guide covers every channel they offer, even ones that are not available on your tier of service.</p><p><img                       lazyload                     src="/images/loading.svg"                     data-src="https://images.wondershare.com/multimedia/tivo-menu.jpg"                      alt="tivo menu"                ></p><p> With the TiVo Roamio, connecting to a tablet allows you to be in another room and still operate the “remote” for the TiVo DVR. Download the app onto your device and you’re ready to go.</p><p> TiVo’s device remote has a sleek layout called the “peanut”.</p><p><img                       lazyload                     src="/images/loading.svg"                     data-src="https://images.wondershare.com/multimedia/tivo-remote.jpg"                      alt="tivo remote"                ></p><p><strong>Summary</strong></p><p> What it all comes down to is looking at how you use your TV, where you get your sources from, and what your budget is. Each device has its own set of things that are appealing, and its own drawbacks. For flexibility of being able to use multiple sources and devices, the TiVo is the clear winner. For cost in the long run, it’s almost a draw. For ease of connection to a TV, the Comcast box comes out on top. No matter which one you pick, you’ll never run out of great programs to watch.</p><p><a href="https://tools.techidaily.com/wondershare/filmora/download/"><img                       lazyload
