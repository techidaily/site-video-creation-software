Whether Middle Earth: Shadow of Mordor, Titanfall or Destiny is your favorite video game or you prefer more nostalgic style game play like Mario Kart 8 or NBA 2K15, chances are you want to record something fantastic that happens (or that you do!) within the game. YouTube is filled with videos of gamers killing the newest games or reviewing new editions on brand new platforms. How do they make those awesome videos and capture all of their great plays? Simple—when you know which programs to use to take advantage of some of the latest software tools that can record your gaming screen effortlessly as you play!

## Record Video Games with Fraps

[Fraps](http://www.fraps.com/) is the old standby that is easy to use, even for recording newbies, and remains the most popular choice for recording video gameplay. Aside from its simple user interface, it can display game benchmarks and easily make adjustments for framerates and sizing. Fraps was designed specifically to run while your games are playing and record in high quality, and it does a great job at that dedicated task. While some users complain that the size of Fraps files are huge, you can use a different application to compress the files for uploading and sharing.

![wondershare video editor](https://images.wondershare.com/images/multimedia/video-editor/fraps.jpg)

## Use liteCam for game recording

The [liteCam game recording software](https://www.litecam.net/en/) can capture your game at up to 60 fps, and it will record OpenGL and DirectX games that other software cannot. While you simply choose from preset keys to set up your recording, which makes it easier to use, there is no option to capture still shots which some people like to have. Even though it does not have quite as many extra settings and tools as a lot of other video game recording software, it does produce good-quality recordings that many gamers appreciate for their use.

![wondershare video editor](https://images.wondershare.com/images/multimedia/video-editor/litecam.jpg)

## Use Wondershare Filmora for game capturing

[Wondershare Filmora](https://tools.techidaily.com/wondershare/filmora/download/) is a multipurpose video software tool with a built-in webcam recorder which allows you to easily capture with your webcam. Audio recording is also made easy, perfect for game players who want to showcase your favorite games with your followers. It offers built-in converters and video editor supporting converting and editing many different video formats shot either with your camcorder or iPhone or Android. Wondershare Filmora is different from some of the others on the market as it not only allows video capture but also provides a handful of video editing, video uploading choices, and it works with multiple devices. This program has a high speed processor and lots of varied settings, and a simple and user-friendly interface, along with exceptional video editing tools to make your recording fun and easy. You can download a 30-day free trial here to check out:

## Record Video Games with Fraps

[Fraps](http://www.fraps.com/) is the old standby that is easy to use, even for recording newbies, and remains the most popular choice for recording video gameplay. Aside from its simple user interface, it can display game benchmarks and easily make adjustments for framerates and sizing. Fraps was designed specifically to run while your games are playing and record in high quality, and it does a great job at that dedicated task. While some users complain that the size of Fraps files are huge, you can use a different application to compress the files for uploading and sharing.

## Use liteCam for game recording

The [liteCam game recording software](https://www.litecam.net/en/) can capture your game at up to 60 fps, and it will record OpenGL and DirectX games that other software cannot. While you simply choose from preset keys to set up your recording, which makes it easier to use, there is no option to capture still shots which some people like to have. Even though it does not have quite as many extra settings and tools as a lot of other video game recording software, it does produce good-quality recordings that many gamers appreciate for their use.
