## Best Free AVCHD Player â€“ Play AVCHD MTS M2TS Video Files

 _Posted by [Kaylee Wood](https://www.quora.com/profile/Amanda-Hu-21) | Last update: April 28, 2020_

You have hours of videos shot with digital camcorders or cameras, maybe Sony or Panasonic camcorders in AVCHD format stored on computers, but regrettably, neither your Windows Media Player nor QuickTime can play the AVCHD videos. To play them smoothly, a specialized AVCHD player named 5KPlayer can help play all AVCHD videos at any resolution without choppy, jerky, stutters, video audio out of sync problem, or other issues. It is the best free **AVCHD Player for Windows and Mac OS**.

Generally speaking, with Windows Media Player 12, Windows 7/8/8.1 users can play AVCHD files; and Mac users running on OS X Mountain Lion or later can play AVCHD videos with default QuickTime Player. Nevertheless, people oftentimes have difficulty playing AVCHD videos smoothly. And those who are working on the operating systems not support for AVCHD format natively, say, Windows Vista users, could not even open AVCHD files. What to do? Waste your valuable time, trouble and effort to find and install the proper AVCHD codec plug-ins on your current player or switch to an all-powerful AVCHD media player like 5KPlayer to directly play AVCHD?

#### **What Is AVCHD? What's the Best Free AVCHD Player?**

[AVCHD](http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/AVCHD) (Advanced Video Coding High Definition) is a file format used on high definition digital camcorders and cameras. And AVCHD files are saved with file extension .mts or .m2ts. AVCHD video is an effective way to store HD videos for its high capability while occupying little of your hard drive space. Nowadays, most camcorders output videos in AVCHD format, but awkwardly, you can hardly find out a suitable [free media player](https://tools.techidaily.com/5kplayer/video-music-player/) compatible with AVCHD perfectly. To play AVCHD videos on computers, you are always required to install codec plug-ins or keep video player updating to the latest version. Good news is that 5KPlayer works in a totally different way.

**5KPlayer** is an internationally recognized good AVCHD player. This AVCHD player is totally free, clean and simple to play AVCHD videos without installing additional codecs. It **plays any AVCHD/MTS/M2TS files** fluently on various Windows and Mac operating systems. And it runs without occupying too much system resources. Try it to play AVCHD videos captured by Sony, Panasonic, Cannon and other camcorders right now.
