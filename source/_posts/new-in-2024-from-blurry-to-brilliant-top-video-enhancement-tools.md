#### **_3._** **_iMovie_**

**Price:** Free

**Compatibility:** macOS, iOS

Instead of spending hundreds of dollars on professional video editing software, Mac owners can try editing their videos in [iMovie](https://www.apple.com/imovie/).

iMovie supports 4K videos, making the editing process fun and easy. You have to arrange your clips on the timeline, select the background music, create opening titles and end credits or add some cool visual effects and you're ready to share your videos with the public. iMovie lets you share your 4k videos to YouTube, Facebook, or Vimeo directly from the Export menu, so you don't have to waste time waiting for your videos to be rendered and uploaded to your social media account.

#### **_5._** **_Adobe Premiere Pro CC_**

**Price:** Monthly license: $35.99

**Compatibility:** Windows, macOS

Over the last couple of decades, the Adobe brand has become synonymous with image editing. The company's software for editing still and moving images is considered among the best by most contemporary photographers, designers, and moviemakers.

Premiere Pro CC enables you to turn the raw footage captured by any camera in any format into awe-inspiring videos. Besides offering superb video editing options that include powerful color correction tools and amazing effects, the software also offers a decent amount of audio editing options.

The only downside is that Premiere Pro CC is not best suited for inexperienced video editors, and it takes quite some time to master all of its features.

#### **_6._** **_Vegas Pro_**

**Price:**$399.00

**Compatibility:** Windows

Although Vegas Pro has never been as popular as Premier Pro, the video editing options, Vega Pro offers are no less powerful than those provided by Adobe's famed video enhancer. Vegas Pro software is equipped with tools that make the video editing process faster while maintaining a high quality of the processed footage.

The latest version of Vegas Pro also features Picture-in-Picture and Crop OFX plug-ins that let you overlay or experiment with several images in a single frame.

#### **_7._** **_Lightworks_**

This video editing software lets you do virtually anything if you know how to do it. Multicam editing, a rich selection of effects, or support for a wide array of video file formats make Lightworks an excellent choice for skilled video editing professionals.

Even though the free version of the software is available, buying a monthly or annual license is a much better option if you want to approach your next project professionally.

#### **_8._** **_Final Cut Pro X_**

**Price:** $249.99

**Compatibility:** macOS

The possibilities Final Cut Pro offers are nearly endless.

Final Cut Pro is unsuitable for beginners in video editing because using most of its features requires an enviable amount of skill.

#### **_Conclusion_**
