Video creation is on the increase, especially with smartphones and easy-to-reach tablets. Simply take a video to share with your loved ones. However, it would make a great difference if you edited your video and added other lovely precepts for detailed expression. Unfortunately, most people find it challenging to create quality videos on their phones.

In most cases, they’ll need to move them to their desktops for polishing and advanced editing. That’s not the case anymore, especially, with the rise of mobile editing applications like the Splice app. It lets you easily create high-quality video content with just a few clicks.

Step 2\. Pick a tool depending on the effect you want to achieve, like a blur, mixing multiple audio tracks, etc.
