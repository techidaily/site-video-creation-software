## Top Video Lighting Adjustment Software

Do you face these kinds of issues a lot while you're shooting through your phone? Although you may make a video at any time using your iPhone or Android smartphone, you are much more likely to face a dull environment that you cannot adjust at the time. Filming in low light may result in a video that is too dark to see clearly and may potentially degrade video quality.

In such cases, employing a video brightness program on your smartphone or Windows computer might be one of the finest ways to brighten a video. Hence, we've compiled a list of some excellent **Video Brightness Editor** tools for you on this page. Read ahead to learn more about their brightness settings and other options.

#### In this article

01 [Best Online Video Editors to Adjust Video Brightness](#part1)

02 [Best Desktop Video Editors to Adjust Video Brightness](#part2)

## Part 1: Best Online Video Editors to Adjust Video Brightness

There are software and internet resources that can assist you in resolving this issue. You may brighten your movies without exerting any effort if you use the correct video brightener application or website. Read about some of this software when you want to learn more about brightening videos.

### **1\.** [**Veed.io**](https://www.veed.io/)

Is it too dark to watch your visuals? There is "light" at the end of the tunnel, so don't panic. You may alter the brightness, contrast, color distribution, backdrop, transparency, and more in your movie using Veed.io color, vibrancy, and flare may be added to your videos.

Alternatively, for a dramatic impact, lower it a little! Our expert brightness editor will bring out the finest in your video, no matter what it is. Launch your preferred web browser, such as Chrome, Opera, or Mozilla Firefox.

To brighten your videos, upload your video to VEED's video editor. Select 'Adjust' after clicking the video track. From left to right, move the Brightness key. You can make gorgeous videos for every social media site, especially intro videos, using VEED (with their Intro Maker). To stay on brand, include your emblem and your graphics.

### 2\. [**Kapwing**](https://www.kapwing.com/)

Another video brightener is Kapwing Video Editor, which brightens videos online without requiring any installations. There is a choice to enter a video URL to add light to the video when utilizing the following online effects to illuminate the video-sharing site.

You may also edit and brighten video by uploading it from your computer's hard disk. There are various more video-related tools available on the internet that assist you in beautifying films for social media posting.

Most of the functionality found in the other social network video editors on our list are available, including video templates, ways to resize and cut your video clips, text tools, and even some basic geometric shapes.

You may also convert, trim, resize, and loop videos with at least 15 video tools, many of which are incorporated with the main Studio software. You may perform everything for free and without any hassle. The subtitle tool, for example, is a fantastic tool that allows users to upload subtitles to the industry standard.SRT file.

### 3\. [**Clipchamp**](https://clipchamp.com/en/)

The first semi-professional video editor on this roster is Clipchamp. Clipchamp includes video templates for just about any scenario you can think of. The program also provides videos in a range of aspect ratios. There's also a good selection of stock audio and video.

You'll also receive a video converter, a video compressor, and a webcam recorder, as well as a few more tools for basic video handling. Essentially, the platform includes everything you'll need to create simple films without having to spend lots of money on technology.

Place your video on the timeline by dragging and dropping it. The editing menu will show when you click on the video. Click "Color Exposure" in the editing menu, and a window with four slider settings will display. To brighten the video, use the "Exposure" slider to the right.

### 4\. [**Clideo**](https://clideo.com/)

Clideo is a cute website that can be used to brighten up dreary films. This website allows you to modify video brightness for free, and you may use it without installing something on your computer. The site is free, but there are certain limits, so you'll need to upgrade to the premium version to use all of the features. Because it is online and operates straight in the browser, you may use it to adjust the brightness of your Windows 7 computer.

All you have to do now is upload the video from your computer that you wish to modify. You may upload up to 500 MBs in the free version. You'll find modification settings on the right when your movie has been uploaded. To lighten your video, drag the Brightness slider to the right. After you've made the necessary edits, you may save the movie to your computer.

## Part 2: Best Desktop Video Editors to Adjust Video Brightness

It's difficult to constantly record a video in great light, so you attempt to brighten a dark movie or modify the brightness of a video to make it appear better for sharing. For the majority of individuals, adjusting the video brightness is a time-consuming and even unpleasant experience in their everyday lives for a variety of reasons.

As a result, many people want to know which desktop video editors are the best for adjusting video brightness. Learn about the applications that can assist you in this endeavor by reading on.

### **1\.** [Wondershare Filmora Video Editor](https://tools.techidaily.com/wondershare/filmora/download/)

[Try It Free](https://tools.techidaily.com/wondershare/filmora/download/)

For macOS 10.12 or later

### **2\.** VSDC Free Video Editor

The VSDC Free Footage Editor, in the hands of a skilled user, can generate some truly professional-looking videos. The application supports virtually all major video formats and includes complex video effects such as object transformation and color correction, and also advanced audio effects such as volume adjustment and sound normalization. You have the luxury of brightening your videos simply by uploading the video from your desktop and making whatever changes that you want to make.

VSDC Free Video Editor is actually free, unlike certain "high-end" editors. You may utilize the whole feature set of the application without having to contend with annoying watermarks. Unfortunately, there is one snag. You must pay if you want technical assistance. (And there's a strong possibility you'll have to.) Subscription for the VSDC Free Video Editor is $1 per month, $5 per half-year, and $10 per year.

### **3\.** iMovie

iMovie for Mac allows you to experience your films in new ways. Make Hollywood-style teasers and gorgeous movies in excellent 4K resolution by quickly browsing your footage and instantly sharing your best moments. Color Balance and Color Correction are two options for brightening a movie in iMovie 10.1 or later. The former has four tabs: Auto, Match Color, White Balance, and Skin Tone Balance, which allow you to make automated color adjustments.

The latter has sliders for manually adjusting brightness, contrast, saturation, shadows, and other parameters. Simply choose the clip you want to change and then select the appropriate tool from the toolbar above the viewer. It's not very technical, but it makes it simple to brighten up a gloomy video.

### 4\. **Premiere** Pro CC

Premiere Pro includes a user interface that is both appealing and versatile. The startup feature enables you to rapidly return to previous projects, start new ones, or browse for Adobe Stock video. You can switch between workspaces for Assembly, Editing, Color, Effects, Audio, and Titles, and the dark system window tends to make your videos the focus of attention.

Premiere Pro CC is another desktop video editor that you can use to brighten your videos. The various parameters in the Lumetri Color panel window inside Premiere Pro CC may be used to accomplish video color correction.

Premiere Pro's Lumetri Color Tools elevate the application to the level of Photoshop for video. These tools provide a surprising amount of color modification and a wide range of film and HDR effects. With keyframes, you may modify the white balance, exposure, contrast, highlights, shadows, and black point, among other things. Modifications for Saturation, Vibrance, Faded Film and Sharpen are also accessible.

### 5\. Final Cut Pro

Final Cut Pro comes with a set of robust manual color correction features that can be used to achieve a wide range of color correction and enhancement features. Creating a color correction effect and then modifying the effect's settings in the Color inspector is how you utilize the tools. Any of the following color correction effects may be used to make manual color modifications to the color tint, brightness, and contrast of the entire clip picture.

Color correction capabilities in Final Cut Pro allow you to fine-tune the look of any video in your project, including still photos, by adjusting color balance, shadow levels, mid-tone thresholds, highlight levels, and much more. Saturation, exposure, and color modifications are all controlled via the Color Board. Adjust the Brightness in the color adjustment panels to brighten your movies.

**Conclusion**

And, of course, video rotation is as easy as ABC! You can follow this step-by-step tutorial to rotate or flip your videos using Filmora 10\. You can apply the same procedure if you have a different version.

**Step 1: Download and Install Filmora**

Visit Filmora Video Editor's [official website](https://tools.techidaily.com/wondershare/filmora/download/) to download the newest version. Click on the “Try it Free” button according to your operating system (look at the icons on the button to identify the OS).

![avi video rotators](https://images.wondershare.com/filmora/article-images/2022/07/avi-video-rotators-1.jpg)

After downloading the setup, double-click the file to install the video editor. Then, open the program.

Feel free to judge the interface (see the image below), as it is pretty simple to understand. So, even if you’re a beginner, you can learn this tool within a few minutes of practice.

![avi video rotators](https://images.wondershare.com/filmora/article-images/2022/07/avi-video-rotators-2.jpg)

**Step 2: Import the Video You Want to Rotate**

The next is to bring the video file to Filmora’s library before proceeding. To do that, click on the “Movie Clip” icon in the center of the interface to select the clip from your computer’s hard drive.

![avi video rotators](https://images.wondershare.com/filmora/article-images/2022/07/avi-video-rotators-3.jpg)

Double-click or select the video and click the “Open” button to import files. The importing process may take several seconds or a few minutes, depending on the video size.

![avi video rotators](https://images.wondershare.com/filmora/article-images/2022/07/avi-video-rotators-4.jpg)

If you’re using Filmora for the first time, you might see the “Create Proxy File” message popping up right after the video import. So, simply click on the “Yes” button to go ahead.

![avi video rotators](https://images.wondershare.com/filmora/article-images/2022/07/avi-video-rotators-5.jpg)

Your video will be stored in the “Project Media” tab and will be visible next to the preview window.

![avi video rotators](https://images.wondershare.com/filmora/article-images/2022/07/avi-video-rotators-6.jpg)

**Step 3: Drag and Drop the Video on Filmora’s Timeline**

To rotate the video, first, you need to add it to the track. For that, take your mouse on the video, and select it by clicking the right button on your mouse. Keep holding the button to drag the video on the timeline. Remove your finger from the button after placing the clip on the track.

![avi video rotators](https://images.wondershare.com/filmora/article-images/2022/07/avi-video-rotators-7.jpg)

Right after the above step, you will get another message to help you decide whether you want to keep the resolution of the video to its original settings or match the media. Choose “Match to Media” for fast rendering.

![avi video rotators](https://images.wondershare.com/filmora/article-images/2022/07/avi-video-rotators-8.jpg)

However, if you’re a professional video editor, feel free to select the option that suits you the most.

**Step 4: Rotate Your Video with Filmora**

Double-click anywhere on the video that is already on the timeline.

![avi video rotators](https://images.wondershare.com/filmora/article-images/2022/07/avi-video-rotators-9.jpg)

You will see three tabs – “Video,” “Color,” and “Animation.” So choose the “Video” tab and click on the “Transform” option.

![avi video rotators](https://images.wondershare.com/filmora/article-images/2022/07/avi-video-rotators-10.jpg)

Once done, you will see three important options, which will help you rotate the video.

First, you will notice the “Rotate” option with an adjustment bar. This option will turn your video to different angles of your choice.

All you need to do is play with the adjustments by grabbing the “Round” knob-like button while keeping an eye on the preview window to see the results.

![avi video rotators](https://images.wondershare.com/filmora/article-images/2022/07/avi-video-rotators-11.jpg)

Just below “Rotate,” you will see the “Flip” option with “Horizontal” and “Vertical” mirror icons. Choosing any one of the icons will make your video mirror flip in horizontal or vertical directions.

![avi video rotators](https://images.wondershare.com/filmora/article-images/2022/07/avi-video-rotators-12.jpg)

The third option is “Scale” beneath the “Flip” option. Similar to the rotate option, this tool also has an adjustment bar. You can make adjustments to magnify or de-magnify the clip to fit the screen. Although this option isn’t mandatory, you can still use it if you find the need.

![avi video rotators](https://images.wondershare.com/filmora/article-images/2022/07/avi-video-rotators-13.jpg)

![avi video rotators](https://images.wondershare.com/filmora/article-images/2022/07/avi-video-rotators-14.jpg)

Now, click the “OK” button to apply rotation and return to the timeline.

![avi video rotators](https://images.wondershare.com/filmora/article-images/2022/07/avi-video-rotators-15.jpg)

**Step 5: Save and Export Rotated Video to Your Widows or MAC**

Here you will learn how to save the project and then export it. If you have already saved the project in the beginning, skip reading this part and directly hit the “Export” button.

Contrarily, you can also directly export your files without saving the project. But you won’t be able to make changes to the same project in the future as all source files will be lost. Therefore, saving the project and then exporting files is recommended.

So, if you’re done with step 4, save your project before going further.

You can go to the “File” tab, choose “Save Project,” and rename the video.

![avi video rotators](https://images.wondershare.com/filmora/article-images/2022/07/avi-video-rotators-16.jpg)

Rename your file and click on the “Save” button.

![avi video rotators](https://images.wondershare.com/filmora/article-images/2022/07/avi-video-rotators-17.jpg)

The new name will appear at the top of Filmora’s interface.

![avi video rotators](https://images.wondershare.com/filmora/article-images/2022/07/avi-video-rotators-18.jpg)

Lastly, click the “Export” button to save the file on your computer.

**Step 4: Rotate Your Video with Filmora**

Double-click anywhere on the video that is already on the timeline.

![avi video rotators](https://images.wondershare.com/filmora/article-images/2022/07/avi-video-rotators-9.jpg)

You will see three tabs – “Video,” “Color,” and “Animation.” So choose the “Video” tab and click on the “Transform” option.

![avi video rotators](https://images.wondershare.com/filmora/article-images/2022/07/avi-video-rotators-10.jpg)

Once done, you will see three important options, which will help you rotate the video.

First, you will notice the “Rotate” option with an adjustment bar. This option will turn your video to different angles of your choice.

All you need to do is play with the adjustments by grabbing the “Round” knob-like button while keeping an eye on the preview window to see the results.

![avi video rotators](https://images.wondershare.com/filmora/article-images/2022/07/avi-video-rotators-11.jpg)

Just below “Rotate,” you will see the “Flip” option with “Horizontal” and “Vertical” mirror icons. Choosing any one of the icons will make your video mirror flip in horizontal or vertical directions.

![avi video rotators](https://images.wondershare.com/filmora/article-images/2022/07/avi-video-rotators-12.jpg)

The third option is “Scale” beneath the “Flip” option. Similar to the rotate option, this tool also has an adjustment bar. You can make adjustments to magnify or de-magnify the clip to fit the screen. Although this option isn’t mandatory, you can still use it if you find the need.

![avi video rotators](https://images.wondershare.com/filmora/article-images/2022/07/avi-video-rotators-14.jpg)

Now, click the “OK” button to apply rotation and return to the timeline.

![avi video rotators](https://images.wondershare.com/filmora/article-images/2022/07/avi-video-rotators-15.jpg)

**Step 5: Save and Export Rotated Video to Your Widows or MAC**

Here you will learn how to save the project and then export it. If you have already saved the project in the beginning, skip reading this part and directly hit the “Export” button.

Contrarily, you can also directly export your files without saving the project. But you won’t be able to make changes to the same project in the future as all source files will be lost. Therefore, saving the project and then exporting files is recommended.

So, if you’re done with step 4, save your project before going further.

You can go to the “File” tab, choose “Save Project,” and rename the video.

![avi video rotators](https://images.wondershare.com/filmora/article-images/2022/07/avi-video-rotators-16.jpg)

Rename your file and click on the “Save” button.

![avi video rotators](https://images.wondershare.com/filmora/article-images/2022/07/avi-video-rotators-17.jpg)

**Step 3: Drag and Drop the Video on Filmora’s Timeline**

To rotate the video, first, you need to add it to the track. For that, take your mouse on the video, and select it by clicking the right button on your mouse. Keep holding the button to drag the video on the timeline. Remove your finger from the button after placing the clip on the track.

![avi video rotators](https://images.wondershare.com/filmora/article-images/2022/07/avi-video-rotators-7.jpg)

Right after the above step, you will get another message to help you decide whether you want to keep the resolution of the video to its original settings or match the media. Choose “Match to Media” for fast rendering.

![avi video rotators](https://images.wondershare.com/filmora/article-images/2022/07/avi-video-rotators-8.jpg)

However, if you’re a professional video editor, feel free to select the option that suits you the most.

**Step 4: Rotate Your Video with Filmora**

Double-click anywhere on the video that is already on the timeline.

![avi video rotators](https://images.wondershare.com/filmora/article-images/2022/07/avi-video-rotators-9.jpg)

You will see three tabs – “Video,” “Color,” and “Animation.” So choose the “Video” tab and click on the “Transform” option.

![avi video rotators](https://images.wondershare.com/filmora/article-images/2022/07/avi-video-rotators-10.jpg)

Once done, you will see three important options, which will help you rotate the video.

First, you will notice the “Rotate” option with an adjustment bar. This option will turn your video to different angles of your choice.

All you need to do is play with the adjustments by grabbing the “Round” knob-like button while keeping an eye on the preview window to see the results.

![avi video rotators](https://images.wondershare.com/filmora/article-images/2022/07/avi-video-rotators-11.jpg)

Just below “Rotate,” you will see the “Flip” option with “Horizontal” and “Vertical” mirror icons. Choosing any one of the icons will make your video mirror flip in horizontal or vertical directions.

![avi video rotators](https://images.wondershare.com/filmora/article-images/2022/07/avi-video-rotators-12.jpg)

The third option is “Scale” beneath the “Flip” option. Similar to the rotate option, this tool also has an adjustment bar. You can make adjustments to magnify or de-magnify the clip to fit the screen. Although this option isn’t mandatory, you can still use it if you find the need.

![avi video rotators](https://images.wondershare.com/filmora/article-images/2022/07/avi-video-rotators-13.jpg)

![avi video rotators](https://images.wondershare.com/filmora/article-images/2022/07/avi-video-rotators-14.jpg)

Now, click the “OK” button to apply rotation and return to the timeline.

![avi video rotators](https://images.wondershare.com/filmora/article-images/2022/07/avi-video-rotators-15.jpg)

**Step 5: Save and Export Rotated Video to Your Widows or MAC**

Here you will learn how to save the project and then export it. If you have already saved the project in the beginning, skip reading this part and directly hit the “Export” button.

Contrarily, you can also directly export your files without saving the project. But you won’t be able to make changes to the same project in the future as all source files will be lost. Therefore, saving the project and then exporting files is recommended.

So, if you’re done with step 4, save your project before going further.

You can go to the “File” tab, choose “Save Project,” and rename the video.

![avi video rotators](https://images.wondershare.com/filmora/article-images/2022/07/avi-video-rotators-16.jpg)

Rename your file and click on the “Save” button.
