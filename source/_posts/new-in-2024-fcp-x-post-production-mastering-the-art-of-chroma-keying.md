## FCP X Post-Production: Mastering the Art of Chroma Keying

# FCP X: Create a Chroma-Key (Green-screen) Effect

Chroma-key (also called "green screen") effects are a staple in video production. What [FCP X effect](https://tools.techidaily.com/wondershare/filmora/download/)does is allow you to make the background behind an actor transparent so you can place the actor into a different environment than a studio.

This is a basic tutorial about Apple Final Cut Pro X, professional video editing software. However, if video editing is new to you, consider [Wondershare Filmora for Mac](https://tools.techidaily.com/wondershare/filmora/download/). This is a powerful but easy-to-use tool for users just starting out. Download the free trial version below.

## Getting Started

First, the best thing you can do to improve the quality of your keys is to improve how you shoot them. Here are seven basic production rules:

* Actors should be at least 10 feet in front of the green screen. This avoids light from the background "spilling" around their body or shoulders.
* In general, don't cast shadows on the green screen. Be very careful shooting feet.
* The green background should be as smooth as possible. Paint is always better than fabric; avoid wrinkles and folds.
* The green background should be lit smoothly, both from side to side and top to bottom. I try to have the green background display between 40-50% level on the waveform monitor.
* There is NO relationship between how the background is lit and how your actors are lit. This article will illustrate that.
* Light your background for smoothness. Light your actors for drama.
* Don't worry about having the green background fill the frame. It only needs to completely surround the edges of your actors. Garbage mattes are used to get rid of junk around the edges.

## Setting up the Key

![fx chroma 01](https://images.wondershare.com/multimedia/fx-chroma-01.jpg)

The green screen image is always placed above the background. You can place either the green screen or background image into the Primary Storyline. I find it easier to put the background in the Primary Storyline, because it makes editing the green screen image easier. But this is purely personal choice.

**Step 1: Select the green screen clip**

From the **Effects Browser > Keying** category, double-click the **Keyer** effect, which applies it to the selected clip. (You can also drag the effect on top of the clip, if you forgot to select the green-screen clip first.)

![fx chroma 02](https://images.wondershare.com/multimedia/fx-chroma-02.jpg)

Don't panic if your image looks weird – we will fix it.

![fx chroma 03](https://images.wondershare.com/multimedia/fx-chroma-03.jpg)

Click the **Sample Color** icon. This allows fine-tuning the selection of the background color.

![fx chroma 04](https://images.wondershare.com/multimedia/fx-chroma-04.jpg)

In the green-screen image, drag to select a representative section of the background. I try to get close to the face, but not so close that I accidentally select loose hair or skin.

Your key should look better immediately. Most of the time, you can probably stop here. But there are three other adjustments that can make your key look even better:

* Cleaning up the matte
* Edge adjustments
* Light wrap

![fx chroma 06](https://images.wondershare.com/multimedia/fx-chroma-06.jpg)

Click the **Matte** button to display your key as a white foreground on a black background.

![fx chroma 07](https://images.wondershare.com/multimedia/fx-chroma-07.jpg)

Your goal is the make the foreground solid white, which means opaque, and the background solid black, which means transparent. Adjust the **Fill Holes** and **Edge Distance** sliders until your key looks solid. (For REALLY bad keys, you'll need to also adjust Color Selection, mentioned below.)

![fx chroma 05](https://images.wondershare.com/multimedia/fx-chroma-05.jpg)

If an edge is too pronounced, or needs help, click the **Edges** icon.

![fx chroma 09](https://images.wondershare.com/multimedia/fx-chroma-09.jpg)

**Step 2: Tweaks Video**

Then, click and drag a line from the foreground to the background in the Canvas. Drag the midpoint slider (where my cursor is) until the edge looks the best it can. Different video formats make this easy (ProRes), while others (HDV, avchd) make this much harder. Perfection is impossible – do the best you can.

![fx chroma 09a](https://images.wondershare.com/multimedia/fx-chroma-09a.jpg)

Final Cut provides four additional tweaks at the bottom of the keyer filter:

* Color Selection
* Matte Tools
* Spill Suppression
* Light Wrap

The first three are designed to clean up poorly shot keys – read the FCP X Help files to learn how these work. (I used the Color Selection tools to clean up the very dark key I use an example later in this article.)

Light wrap, though, is aesthetic. What it does is blend colors from the background into the edges of the foreground, to make the entire key look more "organic," as if the foreground and background were actually in the same space.

This is a subtle effect, but very cool.

![fx chroma 10](https://images.wondershare.com/multimedia/fx-chroma-10.jpg)

Twirl down Light Wrap and adjust the Amount slider and watch what happens. Drag the other sliders around and see what happens. The nice thing about this setting is that when it looks good to you, it is good. The amount of the effect is totally up to you. Remember, Light Wrap only affects the edges of the foreground and should be used subtly.

![fx chroma 11](https://images.wondershare.com/multimedia/fx-chroma-11.jpg)

When you are done, you have a great looking key!

## Clean up the Image with a Garbage Mask

![fx chroma 12](https://images.wondershare.com/multimedia/fx-chroma-12.jpg)

Sometimes, however, you don't have, ah, perhaps, the best green-screen image to work with. Here, for example, there are lighting instruments in the foreground, with a very inadequately lit green screen in the background. (Sigh… this is just pitiful.)

Once you pull the key – which is film-speak for creating a green-screen shot, as I described above – and get it looking as good as possible, there's one more step: adding a garbage matte to get rid of all the garbage surrounding your actors.

![fx chroma 13](https://images.wondershare.com/multimedia/fx-chroma-13.jpg)

Once you get your key looking as good as you can – which in this case isn't all that good – drag the Mask effect (**Effects > Keying > Mask**) on top of the green-screen clip.

**NOTE**: The Mask effect should always be added after the Keying effect, so that the Mask is below the Keyer in the Inspector.

![fx chroma 14](https://images.wondershare.com/multimedia/fx-chroma-14.jpg)

Then, drag each of the four circles to create a shape such that your foreground image is contained inside it, and everything you want to exclude is outside. Here, for instance, we removed the light stand, the edge of the green background and the tearing at the top of the image. I've found this Mask effect works best when applied to a connected clip.

However, the big limitation of the Mask effect is that you only have four points to work with. That's where a free effect comes in, which allows you to create far more flexible shapes with it. It's written by Alex Gollner and is available on his website – alex4d.wordpress.com/fcpx/ – I recommend his effects highly.

## How to Create a Chroma-Key in easier ways?

Chroma-key, or green screen, is an essential part of every editor to make all kinds of effects. Is there any way to make this sophisticated procedure easier way? Yes, try Filmora.

In version 10.5 for Mac, Filmora added a new feature: AI portrait. It allows you to do a green screen effect with just one click.

By adopting AI portrait, you can add those stunning effects in simple steps: How to Remove or Change Video Background in One Step?

## Conclusion

The chroma-key filter in FCP X allows us to create some amazing effects. If you want to use green screen effects more easily, here is [Filmora](https://tools.techidaily.com/wondershare/filmora/download/) for you. You can appaly Chroma-Key effects with just a few click. Have fun playing with it.

* In general, don't cast shadows on the green screen. Be very careful shooting feet.
* The green background should be as smooth as possible. Paint is always better than fabric; avoid wrinkles and folds.
* The green background should be lit smoothly, both from side to side and top to bottom. I try to have the green background display between 40-50% level on the waveform monitor.
* There is NO relationship between how the background is lit and how your actors are lit. This article will illustrate that.
* Light your background for smoothness. Light your actors for drama.
* Don't worry about having the green background fill the frame. It only needs to completely surround the edges of your actors. Garbage mattes are used to get rid of junk around the edges.

## Setting up the Key

![fx chroma 01](https://images.wondershare.com/multimedia/fx-chroma-01.jpg)

The green screen image is always placed above the background. You can place either the green screen or background image into the Primary Storyline. I find it easier to put the background in the Primary Storyline, because it makes editing the green screen image easier. But this is purely personal choice.

**Step 1: Select the green screen clip**

From the **Effects Browser > Keying** category, double-click the **Keyer** effect, which applies it to the selected clip. (You can also drag the effect on top of the clip, if you forgot to select the green-screen clip first.)

![fx chroma 02](https://images.wondershare.com/multimedia/fx-chroma-02.jpg)

Don't panic if your image looks weird – we will fix it.

![fx chroma 03](https://images.wondershare.com/multimedia/fx-chroma-03.jpg)

Click the **Sample Color** icon. This allows fine-tuning the selection of the background color.

![fx chroma 04](https://images.wondershare.com/multimedia/fx-chroma-04.jpg)

In the green-screen image, drag to select a representative section of the background. I try to get close to the face, but not so close that I accidentally select loose hair or skin.

Your key should look better immediately. Most of the time, you can probably stop here. But there are three other adjustments that can make your key look even better:

* Cleaning up the matte
* Edge adjustments
* Light wrap

![fx chroma 06](https://images.wondershare.com/multimedia/fx-chroma-06.jpg)

Click the **Matte** button to display your key as a white foreground on a black background.

![fx chroma 07](https://images.wondershare.com/multimedia/fx-chroma-07.jpg)

Your goal is the make the foreground solid white, which means opaque, and the background solid black, which means transparent. Adjust the **Fill Holes** and **Edge Distance** sliders until your key looks solid. (For REALLY bad keys, you'll need to also adjust Color Selection, mentioned below.)

![fx chroma 05](https://images.wondershare.com/multimedia/fx-chroma-05.jpg)

If an edge is too pronounced, or needs help, click the **Edges** icon.

![fx chroma 09](https://images.wondershare.com/multimedia/fx-chroma-09.jpg)

**Step 2: Tweaks Video**

Then, click and drag a line from the foreground to the background in the Canvas. Drag the midpoint slider (where my cursor is) until the edge looks the best it can. Different video formats make this easy (ProRes), while others (HDV, avchd) make this much harder. Perfection is impossible – do the best you can.

![fx chroma 09a](https://images.wondershare.com/multimedia/fx-chroma-09a.jpg)

Final Cut provides four additional tweaks at the bottom of the keyer filter:

* Color Selection
* Matte Tools
* Spill Suppression
* Light Wrap

The first three are designed to clean up poorly shot keys – read the FCP X Help files to learn how these work. (I used the Color Selection tools to clean up the very dark key I use an example later in this article.)

Light wrap, though, is aesthetic. What it does is blend colors from the background into the edges of the foreground, to make the entire key look more "organic," as if the foreground and background were actually in the same space.

This is a subtle effect, but very cool.

![fx chroma 10](https://images.wondershare.com/multimedia/fx-chroma-10.jpg)

Twirl down Light Wrap and adjust the Amount slider and watch what happens. Drag the other sliders around and see what happens. The nice thing about this setting is that when it looks good to you, it is good. The amount of the effect is totally up to you. Remember, Light Wrap only affects the edges of the foreground and should be used subtly.

![fx chroma 11](https://images.wondershare.com/multimedia/fx-chroma-11.jpg)

When you are done, you have a great looking key!

## Clean up the Image with a Garbage Mask

![fx chroma 12](https://images.wondershare.com/multimedia/fx-chroma-12.jpg)

Sometimes, however, you don't have, ah, perhaps, the best green-screen image to work with. Here, for example, there are lighting instruments in the foreground, with a very inadequately lit green screen in the background. (Sigh… this is just pitiful.)

Once you pull the key – which is film-speak for creating a green-screen shot, as I described above – and get it looking as good as possible, there's one more step: adding a garbage matte to get rid of all the garbage surrounding your actors.

![fx chroma 13](https://images.wondershare.com/multimedia/fx-chroma-13.jpg)

Once you get your key looking as good as you can – which in this case isn't all that good – drag the Mask effect (**Effects > Keying > Mask**) on top of the green-screen clip.

**NOTE**: The Mask effect should always be added after the Keying effect, so that the Mask is below the Keyer in the Inspector.

![fx chroma 14](https://images.wondershare.com/multimedia/fx-chroma-14.jpg)

Then, drag each of the four circles to create a shape such that your foreground image is contained inside it, and everything you want to exclude is outside. Here, for instance, we removed the light stand, the edge of the green background and the tearing at the top of the image. I've found this Mask effect works best when applied to a connected clip.

However, the big limitation of the Mask effect is that you only have four points to work with. That's where a free effect comes in, which allows you to create far more flexible shapes with it. It's written by Alex Gollner and is available on his website – alex4d.wordpress.com/fcpx/ – I recommend his effects highly.

## How to Create a Chroma-Key in easier ways?

Chroma-key, or green screen, is an essential part of every editor to make all kinds of effects. Is there any way to make this sophisticated procedure easier way? Yes, try Filmora.

# Top 10+ Best Free Online Video Editors for Video Editing Online

![author avatar](https://images.wondershare.com/filmora/article-images/ollie-mattison.jpg)

##### Ollie Mattison

 Mar 27, 2024• Proven solutions

With the creation of social video sharing networks online like YouTube, Vimeo, Instagram and Vine, editing and making videos stopped being the exclusive domain of professionals. All you need right now is a good computer system and bingo you are a video editor. You can now edit videos online without downloading any program on your Windows or Mac computer - all you require is a decent network connection to the internet. In this article, we are going to talk about the top 10 most recommended best free online video editing solutions that you can access online.

Most of these free online video editors are beginner-friendly, so even if you just come to the video editing world, you can make a video quickly with these online video editing tools. If you’re an experienced [video editor](https://tools.techidaily.com/wondershare/filmora/download/), then check our picks of the best professional video editing software.

Personally, I don’t recommend using online tools since sometimes the network connection isn’t good, and when there is a network error, all the efforts are gone. Editing videos with online tools also need high upload and download speed, so it’s suitable for editing short and small size video clips. Besides, online video editing solutions maybe not the best choice if you need more advanced editing options and beautiful video effects. In this case, I highly recommend Wondershare Filmora for the tool you can't miss. Just download it to have a try to explore the editing features, plentiful effects and presets. It can be used on Mac and Windows computers both and is suitable for beginners and semi-pros both.

[![Download Filmora Win Version](https://images.wondershare.com/filmora/guide/download-btn-win.jpg) ](https://tools.techidaily.com/wondershare/filmora/download/) [![Download Filmora Mac Version](https://images.wondershare.com/filmora/guide/download-btn-mac.jpg) ](https://tools.techidaily.com/wondershare/filmora/download/)

Note: in the free trial version of Filmora 11, there will be a watermark like most online video editors listed below. But you’re allowed to use all the features and effects and save it to your computer or share it on YouTube or Vimeo directly. If you’re a teacher or a student or school staff, you can enjoy our [discount](https://tools.techidaily.com/wondershare/filmora/download/) on purchasing.

## Top 10+ Best Free Online Video Editors

Though some online video editing tools listed below provide free trial versions, if you need to download the video, you may need to upgrade your free plan to the paid version. And some free versions will leave a watermark on your video footage in 480p quality. So, please pay attention to it before you dive into this online platform. Please note the online video editors listed are in no particular order.

### #2\. ClipChamp

Simple drag and drop features allow you to trim, crop, rotate, and flip videos as per their need. Further, it is also possible to adjust brightness, saturation, and contrast with ease. You can also add transitions, text, overlays, backgrounds. There is a stock library that provides both paid and free video and audio files, so you can choose based on your situation.

You can select **different aspect ratios** such as 1:1, 9:16, 4:3, or 16：9, and it also provides **a built-in guide** so you can make a video with it easily.

Though you can import 4K footage, it is recommended to compress it first since large files may cause problems when editing, and the **video footage can’t be exported in 4K**. I’m not sure what the problem is, but when I added the audio to the video and play it back, it didn’t go smooth. Let me know if you’ve met the same issue when using it in the comment below.

Wideo is an online video creating site for **creating animated videos, explainer videos** and other marketing videos with a lot of video templates. **Sign in first** to make a video online with this animated editor and then drag and drop elements of the website's editing service, create a sequence of animations.

Wideo allows you to use the different elements as many times as you want to create your video and unlike some websites, you are not limited to using stock elements (text, cartoons, drawings, and images) and components. It seems that Wideo only allows you to **upload your own images** in .jpg, .png and .gif and backgrounds or music, I didn’t find out a way to add my own video footage to this online video editor. Let me know if you have any clue.

What I like about Wideo is that it allows you to choose **video aspect ratio** such as 16:9, 1:1, and 9;16, and there are **a lot of video templates** available, although most of them need to pay. It also provides a 7 -day trial, and the paid versions cost from 19/mo to 79/mo.

### #7\. Video Toolbox

![Video Toolbox Online  Video Editor ](https://images.wondershare.com/filmora/article-images/video-toolbox-online-video-editor-interface.jpg)

Touted as the future of video editing, Video Toolbox is a free online platform that in addition to editing your video files analyses it and gives you highly detailed information about the bit rate, codec, frame rate, and resolution.

It can also **convert** your video file to the most popular video formats such as MKV, MOV, MP4, and AVI.

The editing features are **simple and limited** but it also allows you to record a webcam. One amazing thing is that there is no watermark and the video quality is good after cutting clips with Video Toolbox.

You need to **sign up** and activate your account in your email first and then log in to enter the main menu. And to be honest, I found this video editor layout is **outdated and not user-friendly** enough. You need to click the select action to choose the target editing feature and in more cases, there will be **no real-time preview window** to check the editing progress.

### #8\. Kizoa

### #12\. Online Video Cutter

![online video editor](https://tools.techidaily.com/wondershare/filmora/download/)

Though it isn't a video editor to some degree, this intuitive online video editing tool application appears user-friendly and it isn’t limited to cut videos as the name indicates. You can upload videos from computer or via Dropbox, Google Drive or URL directly. With this online video cutter, you can easily **rotate** the videos to 90, 180 or even 270 degrees, **crop** them, **trim** or apply several professional style editing features to create incredible projects.

#### 1\. Is There Any Online Video Editor No Watermark?

Yes, there are some free online video editors without watermarks, such as ClipChamp, Online Video Cutter and Hippo Video after exporting. But you should note that in some online video editing tool, the video resolution may be limited to 480p in the free plan.

While, free online video editors like Clip Champ didn't watermark your video but the quality is limited to 480P. Video Toolbox can remain the original quality and keeps no watermark, but the interface isn't intuitive. The rising star Kapwing will be a good choice if you don't need many editing features.

#### 2\. Is There Any Online Video Maker With Music And Pictures?

For those who want to use the music and pictures from the online video maker, I recommend you try Magisto and Kizoa. From the description of these two editors, you can see they are a perfect match.

 **Conclusion**

Above are some free online video makers that you can use right in your browser on both Windows, Mac, Linux or mobile devices if you like. Most of these online video makers are beginners friendly and easy to use since they provide simple editing features. But some of them may need you to register first to use the online video editing tools, and some may leave a braning watermark in the free version.

However, Filmora is one of the easiest-to-use home video editing software with special editing features lets you seamlessly stitch together video clips, music & text, apply effects and get a professional-looking home movie in minutes. All classic video editing functions such as trim, crop, zoom, cut, split as well as stunning video effects (PIP, Green Screen, Faceo-off, etc) are provided. Up to 100 audio and video tracks to use.

With the creation of social video sharing networks online like YouTube, Vimeo, Instagram and Vine, editing and making videos stopped being the exclusive domain of professionals. All you need right now is a good computer system and bingo you are a video editor. You can now edit videos online without downloading any program on your Windows or Mac computer - all you require is a decent network connection to the internet. In this article, we are going to talk about the top 10 most recommended best free online video editing solutions that you can access online.

Most of these free online video editors are beginner-friendly, so even if you just come to the video editing world, you can make a video quickly with these online video editing tools. If you’re an experienced [video editor](https://tools.techidaily.com/wondershare/filmora/download/), then check our picks of the best professional video editing software.

Personally, I don’t recommend using online tools since sometimes the network connection isn’t good, and when there is a network error, all the efforts are gone. Editing videos with online tools also need high upload and download speed, so it’s suitable for editing short and small size video clips. Besides, online video editing solutions maybe not the best choice if you need more advanced editing options and beautiful video effects. In this case, I highly recommend Wondershare Filmora for the tool you can't miss. Just download it to have a try to explore the editing features, plentiful effects and presets. It can be used on Mac and Windows computers both and is suitable for beginners and semi-pros both.

If you’re a teacher or a student or school staff, you can enjoy our [discount](https://tools.techidaily.com/wondershare/filmora/download/) on purchasing.

Wideo is an online video creating site for **creating animated videos, explainer videos** and other marketing videos with a lot of video templates. **Sign in first** to make a video online with this animated editor and then drag and drop elements of the website's editing service, create a sequence of animations.

Wideo allows you to use the different elements as many times as you want to create your video and unlike some websites, you are not limited to using stock elements (text, cartoons, drawings, and images) and components. It seems that Wideo only allows you to **upload your own images** in .jpg, .png and .gif and backgrounds or music, I didn’t find out a way to add my own video footage to this online video editor.

What I like about Wideo is that it allows you to choose **video aspect ratio** such as 16:9, 1:1, and 9;16, and there are **a lot of video templates** available, although most of them need to pay. It also provides a 7 -day trial, and the paid versions cost from 19/mo to 79/mo.

One amazing thing is that there is no watermark and the video quality is good after cutting clips with Video Toolbox.

You need to **sign up** and activate your account in your email first and then log in to enter the main menu. And to be honest, I found this video editor layout is **outdated and not user-friendly** enough.

Though it isn't a video editor to some degree, this intuitive online video editing tool application appears user-friendly and it isn’t limited to cut videos as the name indicates.

#### 1\. Is There Any Online Video Editor No Watermark?

Yes, there are some free online video editors without watermarks, such as ClipChamp, Online Video Cutter and Hippo Video after exporting. But you should note that in some online video editing tool, the video resolution may be limited to 480p in the free plan.

While, free online video editors like Clip Champ didn't watermark your video but the quality is limited to 480P. Video Toolbox can remain the original quality and keeps no watermark, but the interface isn't intuitive. The rising star Kapwing will be a good choice if you don't need many editing features.

#### 2\. Is There Any Online Video Maker With Music And Pictures?

For those who want to use the music and pictures from the online video maker, I recommend you try Magisto and Kizoa. From the description of these two editors, you can see they are a perfect match.

 **Conclusion**

Above are some free online video makers that you can use right in your browser on both Windows, Mac, Linux or mobile devices if you like. Most of these online video makers are beginners friendly and easy to use since they provide simple editing features. But some of them may need you to register first to use the online video editing tools, and some may leave a braning watermark in the free version.

However, Filmora is one of the easiest-to-use home video editing software with special editing features lets you seamlessly stitch together video clips, music & text, apply effects and get a professional-looking home movie in minutes. All classic video editing functions such as trim, crop, zoom, cut, split as well as stunning video effects (PIP, Green Screen, Faceo-off, etc) are provided. Up to 100 audio and video tracks to use.

It seems that Wideo only allows you to **upload your own images** in .jpg, .png and .gif and backgrounds or music, I didn’t find out a way to add my own video footage to this online video editor. Let me know if you have any clue.

What I like about Wideo is that it allows you to choose **video aspect ratio** such as 16:9, 1:1, and 9;16, and there are **a lot of video templates** available, although most of them need to pay. It also provides a 7 -day trial, and the paid versions cost from 19/mo to 79/mo.

However, if you want to **download** the video on your computer, you’ll **need to upgrade your plan**. If you want to use your own footage and save the edited videos on your desk, Wideo isn't a free option for you.

### #12\. Online Video Cutter

![online video editor](https://tools.techidaily.com/wondershare/filmora/download/)

Though it isn't a video editor to some degree, this intuitive online video editing tool application appears user-friendly and it isn’t limited to cut videos as the name indicates.

#### 1\. Is There Any Online Video Editor No Watermark?

Yes, there are some free online video editors without watermarks, such as ClipChamp, Online Video Cutter and Hippo Video after exporting. But you should note that in some online video editing tool, the video resolution may be limited to 480p in the free plan.

While, free online video editors like Clip Champ didn't watermark your video but the quality is limited to 480P. Video Toolbox can remain the original quality and keeps no watermark, but the interface isn't intuitive. The rising star Kapwing will be a good choice if you don't need many editing features.

#### 2\. Is There Any Online Video Maker With Music And Pictures?

For those who want to use the music and pictures from the online video maker, I recommend you try Magisto and Kizoa. From the description of these two editors, you can see they are a perfect match.

 **Conclusion**

Above are some free online video makers that you can use right in your browser on both Windows, Mac, Linux or mobile devices if you like. Most of these online video makers are beginners friendly and easy to use since they provide simple editing features. But some of them may need you to register first to use the online video editing tools, and some may leave a braning watermark in the free version.

However, Filmora is one of the easiest-to-use home video editing software with special editing features lets you seamlessly stitch together video clips, music & text, apply effects and get a professional-looking home movie in minutes. All classic video editing functions such as trim, crop, zoom, cut, split as well as stunning video effects (PIP, Green Screen, Faceo-off, etc) are provided. Up to 100 audio and video tracks to use.

 Mar 27, 2024• Proven solutions

With the creation of social video sharing networks online like YouTube, Vimeo, Instagram and Vine, editing and making videos stopped being the exclusive domain of professionals. All you need right now is a good computer system and bingo you are a video editor. You can now edit videos online without downloading any program on your Windows or Mac computer - all you require is a decent network connection to the internet. In this article, we are going to talk about the top 10 most recommended best free online video editing solutions that you can access online.

Most of these free online video editors are beginner-friendly, so even if you just come to the video editing world, you can make a video quickly with these online video editing tools. If you’re an experienced [video editor](https://tools.techidaily.com/wondershare/filmora/download/), then check our picks of the best professional video editing software.

Personally, I don’t recommend using online tools since sometimes the network connection isn’t good, and when there is a network error, all the efforts are gone. Editing videos with online tools also need high upload and download speed, so it’s suitable for editing short and small size video clips. Besides, online video editing solutions maybe not the best choice if you need more advanced editing options and beautiful video effects. In this case, I highly recommend Wondershare Filmora for the tool you can't miss. Just download it to have a try to explore the editing features, plentiful effects and presets. It can be used on Mac and Windows computers both and is suitable for beginners and semi-pros both.

Note: in the free trial version of Filmora 11, there will be a watermark like most online video editors listed below. But you’re allowed to use all the features and effects and save it to your computer or share it on YouTube or Vimeo directly. If you’re a teacher or a student or school staff, you can enjoy our [discount](https://tools.techidaily.com/wondershare/filmora/download/) on purchasing.

I’m not sure what the problem is, but when I added the audio to the video and play it back, it didn’t go smooth. Let me know if you’ve met the same issue when using it in the comment below.

You can also add [images to video](https://tools.techidaily.com/wondershare/filmora/download/) to **[make a PIP mode video](https://tools.techidaily.com/wondershare/filmora/download/)**, and some shapes to make the video with fun. Besides, this online video maker also provides samples, so you can use the samples before uploading your own media. You can download the edited video directly or share it to social accounts. There will be a watermark if you didn’t sign in a Kapwing account. To remove it, just sign in with your Google account or Facebook.

### #12\. Online Video Cutter

![online video editor](https://tools.techidaily.com/wondershare/filmora/download/)

Though it isn't a video editor to some degree, this intuitive online video editing tool application appears user-friendly and it isn’t limited to cut videos as the name indicates. You can upload videos from computer or via Dropbox, Google Drive or URL directly. With this online video cutter, you can easily **rotate** the videos to 90, 180 or even 270 degrees, **crop** them, **trim** or apply several professional style editing features to create incredible projects. You can **save the video with the original quality or to 1080P Full HD**.

It can easily handle the **maximum file size of 500MB** and allow users to access any popular media file format with ease. It is free to use and you can access all advanced features even without buying any license.

What I like about this online video editing tool is that **you don’t need to register to use** it and there is also **no watermark** in the saved video. But it would be greater if this online tool can integrate some music and effects as well.

#### 1\. Is There Any Online Video Editor No Watermark?

Yes, there are some free online video editors without watermarks, such as ClipChamp, Online Video Cutter and Hippo Video after exporting. But you should note that in some online video editing tool, the video resolution may be limited to 480p in the free plan.

While, free online video editors like Clip Champ didn't watermark your video but the quality is limited to 480P. Video Toolbox can remain the original quality and keeps no watermark, but the interface isn't intuitive. The rising star Kapwing will be a good choice if you don't need many editing features.

#### 2\. Is There Any Online Video Maker With Music And Pictures?

For those who want to use the music and pictures from the online video maker, I recommend you try Magisto and Kizoa. From the description of these two editors, you can see they are a perfect match.

 **Conclusion**

Above are some free online video makers that you can use right in your browser on both Windows, Mac, Linux or mobile devices if you like. Most of these online video makers are beginners friendly and easy to use since they provide simple editing features. But some of them may need you to register first to use the online video editing tools, and some may leave a braning watermark in the free version.

However, Filmora is one of the easiest-to-use home video editing software with special editing features lets you seamlessly stitch together video clips, music & text, apply effects and get a professional-looking home movie in minutes. All classic video editing functions such as trim, crop, zoom, cut, split as well as stunning video effects (PIP, Green Screen, Faceo-off, etc) are provided. Up to 100 audio and video tracks to use.

One of the best features that help it stand out from the rest of the video editors is that it is supported by all Mac systems and has permitted Apple to make it fully enhanced in terms of efficiency and speed, enabling it to edit even 4K UND footage without any rendering issues.

Along with such exciting advantages, the video editing tool comes with several disadvantages too. It is complex to understand especially for beginners and most importantly it keeps crashing, corrupting the file even if it is saved properly on your Mac system, which can lead to your entire work being lost. Several Final Cut Pro X users complain that their work gets corrupted as the video editing tool keeps crashing after intervals.

If you can relate to this scenario, you will find this blog post helpful as we have listed some methods that can possibly fix the crashing problem and save your hours of video editing efforts. Keep reading to know the steps that can prevent your video editor from crashing.

## Why Does Final Cut Pro X Keep Crashing?

According to Final Cut Pro X users, the video editor is a reliable and solid program, but it can be really frustrating for them when it keeps crashing. If your Final Cut Pro X video editor and program tool also keep acting up, it can probably be because of the corrupted preferences file.

A corrupted preferences file occurs when you do not reset your preferences and settings in the first place. Not resetting the preferences can corrupt the file and end up crashing the video editing tool, damaging the whole video. All those who want to troubleshoot and require methods to fix the crashing issue should take a few steps to resolve the problem which leads us to our second section.

## What to Do if Final Cut Pro X Keeps Crashing on Your Mac System?

One of the major issues in Final Cut Pro X is the crashing problem on the Mac system. If you encounter this problem and learn to isolate, troubleshoot, and fix this issue following the below methods, you will likely resolve the crashing problem on your own. However, you should always ensure keeping a back-up of your Final Cut Pro X media, libraries, and applications as a whole in order to keep the data before following the below steps.

### Method 1: Resetting Final Cut Pro X Preferences and Settings

As mentioned above, resetting the preferences and settings can help in resolving the crashing issue. Resetting preferences will not affect your projects, libraries, or media. With resetting, we mean that you should change the custom preference settings to the default settings. Before you take the plunge to reset your preferences, you should choose Final Cut Pro over Preferences and note all the specific settings that you have to make.

Follow the below steps to reset the preferences in Final Cut Pro X:

**Step 1:** Quit working on Final Cut Pro.

**Step 2:** Hold down the option and command keys, then open the Final Cut Pro.

**Step 3:** Click on the delete preferences option.

**Step 4:** In the last step, recreate the issue that you were having during video editing. If the problem is resolved, you should open Final Cut Pro preferences and apply the custom settings again.

**Step 5:** And, it’s done!

This method will reset all your preferences to default settings and this way it will empty the list of the recent libraries and media. Though the entire libraries are not erased, you will be able to find them in the specified location when you first created them. But they will only be there if you have created a back-up of your data. That is why we mentioned in the beginning to create a back-up of your Final Cut Pro data in the first place.

With the help of fixing the Final Cut Pro X preferences, you will be able to fix a lot of your problems especially the crashing one. The preferences are deeply embedded into the program operation even if we cannot directly amend most of them.

### Method 2: Restart Your Mac

If you find that there is a major crashing problem, another way to fix the problem is to restart the computer and by resetting the Final Cut Pro-related system resources. Here are the steps that you should follow to restart your Mac system:

**Step 1:** Choose the Apple menu.

**Step 2:** Reopen the Final Cut Pro.

**Step 3:** Reproduce the issue and see if the problem still exists.

If your Final Cut Pro X acts up on your Mac system, you should try restarting the system following the aforementioned steps. In case, restarting doesn’t fix the issue, you should apply the first method.
