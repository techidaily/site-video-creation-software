**Step 4**. Adjust the size or position of whatever media you selected in the previous step.

#### 2\. Color Match

**Step 1**. Color correct one video in the timeline like how you’d typically color correct any other video.

If you feel the colors don’t match, you can open the Comparison Preview and use the slider to adjust the colors.

If you want to temporarily reduce one audio track volume so that another is more audible, use audio ducking. You can use it in videos where you want to decrease the volume of music when someone starts speaking to hear them better. Here are the steps:

**Step 1**. Select the audio track you want to make more audible.

**Step 2**. Right-click on it and click on Adjust Audio.

![ajust audio](https://images.wondershare.com/filmora/filmoraX/Guide-Mac/8.ajust-audio.jpg)
