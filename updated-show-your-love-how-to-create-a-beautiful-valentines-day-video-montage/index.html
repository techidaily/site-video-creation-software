However, each of the steps we will cover can be used in other video editors for Mac and Windows. Let’s check how to make a Valentine’s Day video with Filmora.</p>

<h3 id="1-It-all-starts-with-an-Idea"><a href="#1-It-all-starts-with-an-Idea" class="headerlink" title="1. It all starts with an Idea"></a>1. It all starts with an Idea</h3><p>Creating any type of video without having a well-developed idea is virtually impossible because you won’t know which footage to use. Moreover, having an idea of how you want the final draft of the video to look will make it easier for you to select the footage you intend to use during the video editing process.</p>
<p>Once you know exactly what you want to do you can start shooting or collecting the footage you are going to include in your Valentine’s Day video. After you have all the video files you need, place them in one folder, launch Filmora, create a new project and proceed to import the footage by dragging and dropping the files to the editor’s Media tab.</p>
<h3 id="2-Organize-the-Footage-on-the-Timeline-and-Enhance-the-Colors"><a href="#2-Organize-the-Footage-on-the-Timeline-and-Enhance-the-Colors" class="headerlink" title="2. Organize the Footage on the Timeline and Enhance the Colors"></a>2. Organize the Footage on the Timeline and Enhance the Colors</h3><p>During the next step, you should add all video clips you would like to use in your video to the timeline. You can do this by simply dragging a particular video file from the Media tab and dropping it to the desired location on the timeline.</p>
<p><img  
                     lazyload
                     src="/images/loading.svg"

                      alt=" Drag and drop valentines video footage to Filmora "
                ></p>
<p>Optionally, you can use the Split tool to make cuts in a video clip and <a class="link"   target="_blank" rel="noopener" href="https://tools.techidaily.com/wondershare/filmora/download/" >remove parts you don’t want to include in the final version of the video <i class="fa-regular fa-arrow-up-right-from-square fa-sm"></i></a>. When done, you should right-click on each of the video clips you added to the timeline and select <a class="link"   target="_blank" rel="noopener" href="https://tools.techidaily.com/wondershare/filmora/download/" >the Color Correction <i class="fa-regular fa-arrow-up-right-from-square fa-sm"></i></a> option. You can then proceed to fine-tune the Brightness, Contrast, Saturation, or Highlights values depending on how bright or vivid the colors in the original video are. This process can take a while, which is why it is important to be patient and go through it slowly.</p>
<h3 id="3-Add-Romantic-Filters-and-Elements"><a href="#3-Add-Romantic-Filters-and-Elements" class="headerlink" title="3. Add Romantic Filters and Elements"></a>3. Add Romantic Filters and Elements</h3><p>Filmora features Effects and Elements libraries that contain hundreds of different image overlays, filters, and predesigned elements you can add to your project. You just need to click on the Effect or Elements icons in the upper right corner of the screen to start browsing these libraries.</p>
<p><img

                      alt=" Drag and drop valentines element to video in Filmora9 "

It all starts with an Idea</h3><p>Creating any type of video without having a well-developed idea is virtually impossible because you won’t know which footage to use. Moreover, having an idea of how you want the final draft of the video to look will make it easier for you to select the footage you intend to use during the video editing process.</p>
<p>Once you know exactly what you want to do you can start shooting or collecting the footage you are going to include in your Valentine’s Day video. After you have all the video files you need, place them in one folder, launch Filmora, create a new project and proceed to import the footage by dragging and dropping the files to the editor’s Media tab.</p>

Organize the Footage on the Timeline and Enhance the Colors"></a>2. Organize the Footage on the Timeline and Enhance the Colors</h3><p>During the next step, you should add all video clips you would like to use in your video to the timeline. You can do this by simply dragging a particular video file from the Media tab and dropping it to the desired location on the timeline.</p>

                ></p>
<p>Optionally, you can use the Split tool to make cuts in a video clip and <a class="link"   target="_blank" rel="noopener" href="https://tools.techidaily.com/wondershare/filmora/download/" >remove parts you don’t want to include in the final version of the video <i class="fa-regular fa-arrow-up-right-from-square fa-sm"></i></a>. When done, you should right-click on each of the video clips you added to the timeline and select <a class="link"   target="_blank" rel="noopener" href="https://tools.techidaily.com/wondershare/filmora/download/" >the Color Correction <i class="fa-regular fa-arrow-up-right-from-square fa-sm"></i></a> option. You can then proceed to fine-tune the Brightness, Contrast, Saturation, or Highlights values depending on how bright or vivid the colors in the original video are. This process can take a while, which is why it is important to be patient and go through it slowly.</p>

It all starts with an Idea</h3><p>Creating any type of video without having a well-developed idea is virtually impossible because you won’t know which footage to use. Moreover, having an idea of how you want the final draft of the video to look will make it easier for you to select the footage you intend to use during the video editing process.</p>
<p>Once you know exactly what you want to do you can start shooting or collecting the footage you are going to include in your Valentine’s Day video. After you have all the video files you need, place them in one folder, launch Filmora, create a new project and proceed to import the footage by dragging and dropping the files to the editor’s Media tab.</p>
<h3 id="2-Organize-the-Footage-on-the-Timeline-and-Enhance-the-Colors-2"><a href="#2-Organize-the-Footage-on-the-Timeline-and-Enhance-the-Colors-2" class="headerlink" title="2. Organize the Footage on the Timeline and Enhance the Colors"></a>2. Organize the Footage on the Timeline and Enhance the Colors</h3><p>During the next step, you should add all video clips you would like to use in your video to the timeline. You can do this by simply dragging a particular video file from the Media tab and dropping it to the desired location on the timeline.</p>
<p><img  
                     lazyload
                     src="/images/loading.svg"

                      alt=" Drag and drop valentines video footage to Filmora "
                ></p>
<p>Optionally, you can use the Split tool to make cuts in a video clip and <a class="link"   target="_blank" rel="noopener" href="https://tools.techidaily.com/wondershare/filmora/download/" >remove parts you don’t want to include in the final version of the video <i class="fa-regular fa-arrow-up-right-from-square fa-sm"></i></a>. When done, you should right-click on each of the video clips you added to the timeline and select <a class="link"   target="_blank" rel="noopener" href="https://tools.techidaily.com/wondershare/filmora/download/" >the Color Correction <i class="fa-regular fa-arrow-up-right-from-square fa-sm"></i></a> option. You can then proceed to fine-tune the Brightness, Contrast, Saturation, or Highlights values depending on how bright or vivid the colors in the original video are. This process can take a while, which is why it is important to be patient and go through it slowly.</p>
<h3 id="3-Add-Romantic-Filters-and-Elements-2"><a href="#3-Add-Romantic-Filters-and-Elements-2" class="headerlink" title="3. Add Romantic Filters and Elements"></a>3. Add Romantic Filters and Elements</h3><p>Filmora features Effects and Elements libraries that contain hundreds of different image overlays, filters, and predesigned elements you can add to your project. You just need to click on the Effect or Elements icons in the upper right corner of the screen to start browsing these libraries.</p>
<p><img  
                     lazyload

                      alt=" Drag and drop valentines element to video in Filmora9 "
                ></p>
<p>Once you find a romantic filter or element you want to apply to your footage, you should simply drag and drop it to the video track that is located directly above the one on which your footage is located. You should then position an <a class="link"   target="_blank" rel="noopener" href="https://tools.techidaily.com/wondershare/filmora/download/" >overlay, a filter, or an element <i class="fa-regular fa-arrow-up-right-from-square fa-sm"></i></a> at the exact spot where you want them to appear in your video.</p>
<p><img

                ></p>
<p>In case you want to adjust the intensity of an effect you applied you should just double-click on it and then use the Alpha slider to adjust the effect’s intensity. Double-clicking on an element you placed on the timeline will grant you access to the Video tab where you can rotate it, change its on-screen position, or set its Opacity value.</p>

<h3 id="4-Apply-Text-Layers-2"><a href="#4-Apply-Text-Layers-2" class="headerlink" title="4. Apply Text Layers"></a>4. Apply Text Layers</h3><p>The Titles tab contains more than a hundred different Openers, End Credits, or Titles options you can use in all of your projects. Simply pick the one that best matches the style of your video, then add it to the timeline and double-click on it in order to start customizing it.</p>
<p><img

                      alt=" Drag and drop valentines texts and titles  to video in Filmora9 "
                ></p>
<p>Once you <a class="link"   target="_blank" rel="noopener" href="https://tools.techidaily.com/wondershare/filmora/download/" >insert the text <i class="fa-regular fa-arrow-up-right-from-square fa-sm"></i></a>, you can pick the font, color, or this size of the text, as well as set the spacing between two lines of text. Optionally, you can use Filmora’s Advanced Text Edit window if you want to have complete control over all layers of text you add to your video.</p>
<h3 id="5-Create-the-Soundtrack-2"><a href="#5-Create-the-Soundtrack-2" class="headerlink" title="5. Create the Soundtrack"></a>5. Create the Soundtrack</h3><p>Music will give your video the rhythm and it will make it more entertaining to watch, which is the reason why you shouldn’t skip this step. In case, you already have an audio file you would like to use as a soundtrack for your Valentine’s Day video, you can import it into Fimora the same way you would import a video file. You can then add it to an audio track and adjust its duration so that it matches the duration of the entire video.</p>
<p><img  
                     lazyload
                     src="/images/loading.svg"

                      alt=" add music for valentines video in Filmora9 "
                ></p>
<p>You can also use Filmora’s library of <a class="link"   target="_blank" rel="noopener" href="https://tools.techidaily.com/wondershare/filmora/download/" >royalty-free songs <i class="fa-regular fa-arrow-up-right-from-square fa-sm"></i></a> to create the soundtrack for the video you are making. Just head over to the Audio tab, pick a song from Electronic, Rock, or Tender &amp; Sentimental categories, and add it to the timeline.</p>
<h3 id="6-Export-the-Video-2"><a href="#6-Export-the-Video-2" class="headerlink" title="6. Export the Video"></a>6. Export the Video</h3><p>When done with all these steps, you should preview the video you’ve created and if you like the results click on the Export button. You can then proceed to select the video format in which your video is going to be exported, choose the preferred resolution or the <a class="link"   target="_blank" rel="noopener" href="https://tools.techidaily.com/wondershare/filmora/download/" >frame rate <i class="fa-regular fa-arrow-up-right-from-square fa-sm"></i></a>.</p>
<p>Furthermore, Filmora lets you export all videos directly to your YouTube or Vimeo channels, which can save you a lot of time on uploading videos to these video hosting platforms. Nonetheless, how long the rendering process is going to take depends on your computer’s processing power.</p>

                ></p>

<p>As it is now the second decade of the 21st century, data carriers like DVDs are slowly becoming obsolete. A growing number of laptop and desktop PCs no longer feature optical disc drives, while the discontinuation of the Windows Media Center marked the end of an era in which Windows OS offered a built-in DVD player.</p>
<p>The Windows 10 doesn’t have a native app that enables you to play movies or music from DVD and Blu-ray discs, and you must install a third-party DVD<a class="link"   target="_blank" rel="noopener" href="https://tools.techidaily.com/wondershare/filmora/download/" >video player <i class="fa-regular fa-arrow-up-right-from-square fa-sm"></i></a> if you want to view content from these sources. Luckily there is no shortage of media players that are compatible with Windows 10, so in this article, we are going to take you through some of the <strong>best free DVD players</strong> on the market and help you choose the one that meets all your needs.</p>
<h2 id="Best-Free-DVD-Players-for-Windows-10"><a href="#Best-Free-DVD-Players-for-Windows-10" class="headerlink" title="Best Free DVD Players for Windows 10"></a>Best Free DVD Players for Windows 10</h2><p>Before you opt for one DVD player or the other you must first check which audio and <a class="link"   target="_blank" rel="noopener" href="https://tools.techidaily.com/wondershare/filmora/download/" >video file formats <i class="fa-regular fa-arrow-up-right-from-square fa-sm"></i></a> they support or find out if you can use them to play Blu-ray discs. You should also check a player’s compatibility with the operating system you have installed on your computer and that you have all the codecs necessary to play ISO and other image, audio and video file format. So let’s take a look at ten best free DVD players for Windows 10.</p>
<h3 id="1-VLC-Media-Player-by-VideoLan"><a href="#1-VLC-Media-Player-by-VideoLan" class="headerlink" title="1. VLC Media Player by VideoLan"></a>1. <a class="link"   target="_blank" rel="noopener" href="https://www.videolan.org/" >VLC Media Player by VideoLan <i class="fa-regular fa-arrow-up-right-from-square fa-sm"></i></a></h3><p>Over the course of the last two decades, VLC has established itself as one of the most versatile media players ever created. This cross-platform app can be used on Macs, PCs, Linux computers and Smartphones to play different types of audio, image and video files. In fact, VLC is probably the most reliable <a class="link"   target="_blank" rel="noopener" href="https://tools.techidaily.com/wondershare/filmora/download/" >DVD player <i class="fa-regular fa-arrow-up-right-from-square fa-sm"></i></a> you can find, as it allows you to play DVD and Blu-ray discs effortlessly. However, if you want to <a class="link"   target="_blank" rel="noopener" href="https://tools.techidaily.com/wondershare/filmora/download/" >watch videos in 4K <i class="fa-regular fa-arrow-up-right-from-square fa-sm"></i></a>or 8K resolution, you must install the VLC 3.0 Vetinari update of the media player.</p>
<p>What’s more, playing a DVD or a Blu-ray with VLC is a simple task you can complete in just a few clicks. The Open Disc option that is located in the player’s Media menu enables you to choose if you would like to open a DVD, VCD, Audio CD or Blu-ray disc. Moreover, you won’t need to install additional  or MPEG-4 codecs, since VLC can play the vast majority of video files regardless of the codec they are using.</p>
<p><strong>Pros</strong></p>
<ul>
<li>Available to all PC and Mac users for free</li>
<li>The most versatile media player on the market</li>
<li>Offers basic video editing options</li>

Besides providing support for all commonly used video file formats and allowing you to play DVDs, <a class="link"   target="_blank" rel="noopener" href="https://tools.techidaily.com/wondershare/filmora/download/" >Blu-rays <i class="fa-regular fa-arrow-up-right-from-square fa-sm"></i></a> or audio CDs, PotPlayer also offers support for different types of 3D glasses. This Windows-based media player is equipped with enhanced H&#x2F;W Acceleration technology that enables the software to assist the CPU and GPU during the playback of demanding video files.</p>
<p>PotPlayer has all the codecs that are required for the playback of various types of multimedia files, so you don’t have to waste time searching for the codec packs that make possible playing video and audio content that is stored on DVDs or Blu-rays.

However, the free version of BlazeDVD doesn’t allow you to open region coded DVDs and Blu-rays or <a class="link"   target="_blank" rel="noopener" href="https://tools.techidaily.com/wondershare/filmora/download/" >add subtitles <i class="fa-regular fa-arrow-up-right-from-square fa-sm"></i></a> to your files. So if you want to gain access to all the features this DVD player has to offer, you must make a one-time payment of $49.96 and upgrade to its Pro version. Both versions of BlazeDVD let you play DVDs, VCDs or SVCDs and allow you to choose between different playback modes.</p>
<p>The Surround Sound support enhances the audio playback and provides a theater-like experience to the viewers. Moreover, you can choose between ten audio filters you can apply to media files you open with BlazeDVD or use the Parental Control feature if you want to restrict the access to violent content to your children. Creating slideshows from still images or recording videos in an MPEG2 file format are also among the options you are going to have at your disposal if you opt for the paid version of BlazeDVD.</p>
<p><strong>Pros</strong></p>
<ul>
<li>Excellent audio playback capabilities</li>
<li>Features a learning mode</li>

Its video playback features are nothing short of amazing since GOM enables you to play videos in various resolutions and file formats. However, if you would like to use this media player to open Blu-ray discs you must ensure that you have the necessary codecs. Even so, GOM features a variety of built-in codecs such as Vobris, H263, MP42 or XVID that ensure you can open almost all types of video files.</p>
<p>Besides stunning video playback capabilities that even allow you to view 360° VR videos, GOM also features an extensive subtitle library. The media player searches for subtitles automatically and if it finds a subtitle for a particular video it adds them automatically. Upgrading to the paid version of the GOM media player can be a good idea if you want to get rid of ads or make sure that the playback of 4K UHD video files is smooth.</p>
