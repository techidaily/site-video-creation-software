![author avatar](https://images.wondershare.com/filmora/article-images/max-wales-author.jpg)

##### Max Wales

 Mar 27, 2024• Proven solutions

Red, Panavision Sony or Sharp are some of the leaders on the 8K camera market, but the footage these cameras capture isn’t compatible with all video editing apps for Macs and PCs. Currently, there are only a handful of 8K video editors you can use to process footage captured in 8K resolution professionally.

Even so, 8K video files can be edited with some [powerful video editing software](https://tools.techidaily.com/wondershare/filmora/download/). In this article, we are going to take you through some of the **best 8K video editing software** products on the market and help you select the app that can cater to all of your video editing needs.

## 3 Best 4K/8K Video Editing Software Products

Editing the footage recorded in 8K resolution at the professional level requires much more than a versatile video editing app. A computer’s processing power, having sufficient storage space, and a monitor that can display 8K videos accurately are all factors that can simplify and facilitate the video editing process. So let’s that a look at some of the **best 8K video editing apps** film and TV industry professionals can use to process the footage captured in 8K resolution.

#### 1\. [Wondershare Filmora](https://tools.techidaily.com/wondershare/filmora/download/) \- for 4K video editing

It doesn't support 8k video yet, but mostly for 4K video editing, it's your best choice. The latest version of Filmora [video editor](https://tools.techidaily.com/wondershare/filmora/download/) is the stripped back, simpler option for video editors who do not want the complexity, advanced features and extra cost of the professional video editing software. It features an interface that has been created for ease of use, but there is also the option to select between Expert or Quick editing modes, depending upon your skill level and needs.

![ Filmora 9  4K video Editing](https://images.wondershare.com/filmora/article-images/start-filmora9-editing.jpg)

Cool effects include the particularly interesting Hollywood style effects, sound effects and stunning templates. Other interesting and new features include the [Green Screen](https://tools.techidaily.com/wondershare/filmora/download/) and Scene Detection options. The software can also automatically fix the footage with lighting or color issues which can result in a much more polished end result.

### 2\. Adobe Premiere Pro - for 8K video editing

**Price:** $20,99 per month as a single app

**Compatibility:** macOS, Windows

Importing and editing 8K footage with Adobe Premiere Pro CC 2019 isn’t any different than editing videos captured in lower resolutions. However, this video editing software for Mac and PC computers **doesn’t let you choose the 8K resolution from its Export window**. That is why you must adjust a project’s resolution from the Sequence Settings window before you actually start manipulating the footage.

So if you change the Editing mode to Custom and you set the resolution of a sequence to 7680 x 4320, Adobe Premiere Pro will allow you to export your video in the 8K resolution.

There are many choices of software for video editing, but there is one that has been dominating the market for years – this is Final Cut Pro. Final Cut Pro, which was created by Apple, and took on a completely different path from other professional software.

The unique thing about Final Cut Pro is that it allows you to create video files easily and even edit them on the Mac using Final Cut Pro software alone, without any outside help. Before buying Final cut pro, you may want to have a [90-day free trial of FCPX.](https://tools.techidaily.com/wondershare/filmora/download/)

The Mac App Store has made editing software more affordable. When Apple first acquired the Final Cut, it sold for $2,500, but now you can get a full version of the program from their store for only a cent shy of $300—an incredible deal.

## **Part 1: What is in Apple's Pro Apps Bundle for Education?**

The Pro Apps Bundle includes five industry-leading professional software from Apple. These powerful creative tools are best for musicians, video editors, and anyone looking to create the best content.

Plus, this bundle is also available to students, educators, faculty members at colleges or universities, and employees of any K-12 school district. Apple's Pro Apps Bundle for Education includes Final Cut Pro, Logic Studio, Motion, MainStage, and Compressor.

There's no time limit to ownership, and it doesn't ask for a subscription or membership fee, unlike other subscription-based tools and software like Adobe Premiere Pro or Adobe Photoshop.

Apple's Pro Apps Bundle for Education at $199.99 is totally worth getting if you plan to use Final Cut Pro and want Logic Studio and Mainstage 3 for free. If you're thinking about purchasing Final Cut Pro or Logic Studio separately, be prepared to pay $299.99 and $199.99, respectively. MainStage is more affordable at $29.99\. Motion and Compressor aren't sold separately as they come bundled with Final Cut Pro.

**So, exactly how much are you saving here?**

If you need Final Cut Pro for work, we suggest you buy Pro Apps Bundle for Education, as you'll be saving $100\. You'll also get Logic Pro and Mainstage for free. In total, you'll be saving **$330**—an unbeatable deal if you ask me. I don't anyone offers that kind of deal.

If you're a musician or composer and have no use for Final Cut Pro, you can buy Logic Studio for $199.99—that's your decision. But, you need to purchase Mainstage for $29.99, in case you need it. Nonetheless, we still recommend you get the Apple's Pro Apps Bundle for Education at $199.99.

For beginners who don't actually need those many apps can always go with a **cheaper yet maybe better editor, Filmora**. Click and have a try!

There are many choices of software for video editing, but there is one that has been dominating the market for years – this is Final Cut Pro. Final Cut Pro, which was created by Apple, and took on a completely different path from other professional software.

The unique thing about Final Cut Pro is that it allows you to create video files easily and even edit them on the Mac using Final Cut Pro software alone, without any outside help. Before buying Final cut pro, you may want to have a [90-day free trial of FCPX.](https://tools.techidaily.com/wondershare/filmora/download/)

The Mac App Store has made editing software more affordable. When Apple first acquired the Final Cut, it sold for $2,500, but now you can get a full version of the program from their store for only a cent shy of $300—an incredible deal.

## **Part 1: What is in Apple's Pro Apps Bundle for Education?**

The Pro Apps Bundle includes five industry-leading professional software from Apple. These powerful creative tools are best for musicians, video editors, and anyone looking to create the best content.

Plus, this bundle is also available to students, educators, faculty members at colleges or universities, and employees of any K-12 school district. Apple's Pro Apps Bundle for Education includes Final Cut Pro, Logic Studio, Motion, MainStage, and Compressor.

![pro-apps](https://images.wondershare.com/filmora/images/final-cut-pro/pro-apps.png)

 Apple has set pricing for its Pro Apps Bundle for Education at $199.99\. The bundle includes full versions of each software. There's no time limit to ownership, and it doesn't ask for a subscription or membership fee, unlike other subscription-based tools and software like Adobe Premiere Pro or Adobe Photoshop.

Apple's Pro Apps Bundle for Education at $199.99 is totally worth getting if you plan to use Final Cut Pro and want Logic Studio and Mainstage 3 for free. If you're thinking about purchasing Final Cut Pro or Logic Studio separately, be prepared to pay $299.99 and $199.99, respectively. MainStage is more affordable at $29.99\. Motion and Compressor aren't sold separately as they come bundled with Final Cut Pro.

**So, exactly how much are you saving here?**

If you need Final Cut Pro for work, we suggest you buy Pro Apps Bundle for Education, as you'll be saving $100\. You'll also get Logic Pro and Mainstage for free. In total, you'll be saving **$330**—an unbeatable deal if you ask me. I don't anyone offers that kind of deal.

If you're a musician or composer and have no use for Final Cut Pro, you can buy Logic Studio for $199.99—that's your decision. But, you need to purchase Mainstage for $29.99, in case you need it. Nonetheless, we still recommend you get the Apple's Pro Apps Bundle for Education at $199.99.

For beginners who don't actually need those many apps can always go with a **cheaper yet maybe better editor, Filmora**. Click and have a try!
