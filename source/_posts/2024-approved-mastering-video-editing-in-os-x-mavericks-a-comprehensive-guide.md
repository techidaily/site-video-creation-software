![author avatar](https://images.wondershare.com/filmora/article-images/richard-bennett.jpg)

 Mar 27, 2024• Proven solutions

It is hard to believe that in 2024 Google Play had just fifty apps since it currently offers 2.8 million applications that can be used for anything from photo and [video editing](https://tools.techidaily.com/wondershare/filmora/download/) to learning a new language.

This year Google Play had a difficult task of selecting the best app of 2024, as there are so many apps across different categories that are worthy of this award. On December 3rd Google Play announced its choice and also presented the best Android apps of 2024 that were selected by users. So without further ado let’s take a look at the best and most popular Android apps of 2024

## The Best App of 2024 Selected by Google Play: [Ablo](https://play.google.com/store/apps/details?id=live.ablo&hl=en)

Language barriers can prevent us from exploring the world and experiencing different cultures. So, it is no wonder that an app that enables its users to talk to people from around the globe in their mother tongue was chosen as the best app of 2024 by Google Play.

![ 
Ablo: Make new friends from all over the world ](https://images.wondershare.com/filmora/article-images/ablo-chat-app-best-app-google-play.jpg)

Ablo translates all chat messages in real-time which enables you to talk with all likeminded people you meet even if you don’t speak the same language.

The app also translates video calls live and allows you to have meaningful conversations with friends that come from different parts of the world. If you are traveling often and looking for an easy way to encounter the local culture or you just want to communicate with people whose language you don’t understand, then you should install Ablo and start making friends around the world.

## The Most Popular Apps of 2024 on Google Play

Smartphones bring entertainment to the palms of our hands and grant us instant access to information that makes our lives easier. Over the course of 2024 apps from a broad range of categories have sparked the interest of thousands of Android users. Here are some of the most popular apps of 2024 that can help you improve your productivity or make better fashion choices.

### 1\. [Peloton](https://play.google.com/store/apps/details?id=com.onepeloton.callisto&hl=en)

**Price:**Free, but offers in-app purchases

**Supported OS:**Requires Android 5.1 or up

**Category:**Health & Fitness

![InShot Video Editor - Glitch Video Effects ](https://images.wondershare.com/filmora/article-images/peloton-most-popular-app-android.jpg)

Leading a healthy lifestyle is much easier if you have the assistance of the world’s leading instructors. If you already own a Peloton bike or tread, then you can enjoy all the benefits of the Peloton app for free. Yoga, cardio or indoor cycling are just a few among numerous types of classes you can attend through this Android app. In addition, you can also broadcast your workouts through the Peloton’s Chromecast support and share your daily workout routines with thousands of followers. Even so, the app’s interface is somewhat outdated and the app crashes easily during workouts, which makes using Peloton frequently a bit difficult.

### 2\. [21 Buttons](https://play.google.com/store/apps/details?id=com.android21buttons&hl=en)

**Price:**Free

**Supported OS:**Requires Android 5.0 or up

This social network for fashion enthusiasts can help you choose new outfits and save them in your public or private closets. What’s more, you can share the fashion choices with your followers and link to the stores where particular items can be purchased.

### 3\. [Post-it®](https://play.google.com/store/apps/details?id=com.mmm.postit&hl=en)

**Price:**Free

**Supported OS:**Android 7.0 and up

**Category:**Productivity

![Most popular apps on Google Play - Post-it](https://images.wondershare.com/filmora/article-images/post-it-app-for-android.jpg)

Managing and organizing vast amounts of handwritten notes is a futile effort as sorting out hundreds of tiny pieces of paper is often impossible. Installing the Post-it app that captures handwritten notes and allows you to organize them in any way you want can help you perform your daily tasks more efficiently.

Scripts by Drops employs visual learning techniques that help the app’s users connect letters and characters to their pronunciations. If you opt for one of the available subscription models you will have an unlimited amount of learning time at your disposal.

 Mar 27, 2024• Proven solutions

It is hard to believe that in 2024 Google Play had just fifty apps since it currently offers 2.8 million applications that can be used for anything from photo and [video editing](https://tools.techidaily.com/wondershare/filmora/download/) to learning a new language.

This year Google Play had a difficult task of selecting the best app of 2024, as there are so many apps across different categories that are worthy of this award. On December 3rd Google Play announced its choice and also presented the best Android apps of 2024 that were selected by users. So without further ado let’s take a look at the best and most popular Android apps of 2024

## The Best App of 2024 Selected by Google Play: [Ablo](https://play.google.com/store/apps/details?id=live.ablo&hl=en)

Language barriers can prevent us from exploring the world and experiencing different cultures. So, it is no wonder that an app that enables its users to talk to people from around the globe in their mother tongue was chosen as the best app of 2024 by Google Play.

![ 
Ablo: Make new friends from all over the world ](https://images.wondershare.com/filmora/article-images/ablo-chat-app-best-app-google-play.jpg)

Ablo translates all chat messages in real-time which enables you to talk with all likeminded people you meet even if you don’t speak the same language.

The app also translates video calls live and allows you to have meaningful conversations with friends that come from different parts of the world. If you are traveling often and looking for an easy way to encounter the local culture or you just want to communicate with people whose language you don’t understand, then you should install Ablo and start making friends around the world.

## The Most Popular Apps of 2024 on Google Play

Smartphones bring entertainment to the palms of our hands and grant us instant access to information that makes our lives easier. Over the course of 2024 apps from a broad range of categories have sparked the interest of thousands of Android users. Here are some of the most popular apps of 2024 that can help you improve your productivity or make better fashion choices.

### 1\. [Peloton](https://play.google.com/store/apps/details?id=com.onepeloton.callisto&hl=en)

**Price:**Free, but offers in-app purchases

**Supported OS:**Requires Android 5.1 or up

**Category:**Health & Fitness

![InShot Video Editor - Glitch Video Effects ](https://images.wondershare.com/filmora/article-images/peloton-most-popular-app-android.jpg)

Leading a healthy lifestyle is much easier if you have the assistance of the world’s leading instructors. If you already own a Peloton bike or tread, then you can enjoy all the benefits of the Peloton app for free. Yoga, cardio or indoor cycling are just a few among numerous types of classes you can attend through this Android app. In addition, you can also broadcast your workouts through the Peloton’s Chromecast support and share your daily workout routines with thousands of followers. Even so, the app’s interface is somewhat outdated and the app crashes easily during workouts, which makes using Peloton frequently a bit difficult.

### 2\. [21 Buttons](https://play.google.com/store/apps/details?id=com.android21buttons&hl=en)

**Price:**Free

**Supported OS:**Requires Android 5.0 or up

**Category:**Social

If you would like to keep track of the latest fashion trends and discover places where you can buy clothes and accessories worn by your favorite influencers, then you should install the 21 Buttons app on your phone. This social network for fashion enthusiasts can help you choose new outfits and save them in your public or private closets. What’s more, you can share the fashion choices with your followers and link to the stores where particular items can be purchased. This app also enables you to search for up and coming brands, since it is hard to find a fashion brand that isn’t featured on 21 Buttons.

### 3\. [Post-it®](https://play.google.com/store/apps/details?id=com.mmm.postit&hl=en)

**Price:**Free

**Supported OS:**Android 7.0 and up

**Category:**Productivity

![Most popular apps on Google Play - Post-it](https://images.wondershare.com/filmora/article-images/post-it-app-for-android.jpg)

Managing and organizing vast amounts of handwritten notes is a futile effort as sorting out hundreds of tiny pieces of paper is often impossible. Installing the Post-it app that captures handwritten notes and allows you to organize them in any way you want can help you perform your daily tasks more efficiently. Once you’ve created and organized your board you can share it with your colleagues or export it to Excel, PowerPoint or Trello.

Each not you create with this app can be easily edited or deleted.

Scripts by Drops limits the total amount of time you can spend practicing a new language to just five minutes a day. Even though this may seem far from enough to master Chinese Hanzi or to learn Russian Cyrillic, this app will deliver the results you’re looking for as long as you keep using it every single day. Scripts by Drops employs visual learning techniques that help the app’s users connect letters and characters to their pronunciations. If you opt for one of the available subscription models you will have an unlimited amount of learning time at your disposal.

### 5\. [Boosted – Productivity and Time Tracker](https://play.google.com/store/apps/details?id=com.boostedproductivity.app&hl=en)

**Price:**Free

**Supported OS:**Requires Android 4.4 and up

The app’s photo editor features a versatile set of [photo editing tools](https://tools.techidaily.com/wondershare/filmora/download/) that give you complete creative control over the pictures you’re editing. You should keep in mind that you have to make in-app purchases if you want to use all of the animation and photo editing tools Enlight Pixaloop has to offer.

### 7\. [Morphin CGI GIF Maker and Editor](https://play.google.com/store/apps/details?id=io.morphin&hl=en)

**Price:**Free

**Supported OS:**Requires Android 4.4 and up

**Category:**Video players and editors

The app doesn’t add watermarks to the GIFs you create and allows you to share them on Instagram, WhatsApp, Messenger and countless other messaging and social media apps. However, there isn’t much more you can do with Morphin other than create GIFs, and you should consider installing another app if you want to edit videos.

**Price:**Free, but offers in-app purchases

**Supported OS:**Requires Android 5.0 and up

It is hard to believe that in 2024 Google Play had just fifty apps since it currently offers 2.8 million applications that can be used for anything from photo and [video editing](https://tools.techidaily.com/wondershare/filmora/download/) to learning a new language.

This year Google Play had a difficult task of selecting the best app of 2024, as there are so many apps across different categories that are worthy of this award. On December 3rd Google Play announced its choice and also presented the best Android apps of 2024 that were selected by users. So without further ado let’s take a look at the best and most popular Android apps of 2024

## The Best App of 2024 Selected by Google Play: [Ablo](https://play.google.com/store/apps/details?id=live.ablo&hl=en)

Language barriers can prevent us from exploring the world and experiencing different cultures. So, it is no wonder that an app that enables its users to talk to people from around the globe in their mother tongue was chosen as the best app of 2024 by Google Play.

![ 
Ablo: Make new friends from all over the world ](https://images.wondershare.com/filmora/article-images/ablo-chat-app-best-app-google-play.jpg)

Ablo translates all chat messages in real-time which enables you to talk with all likeminded people you meet even if you don’t speak the same language.

The app also translates video calls live and allows you to have meaningful conversations with friends that come from different parts of the world. If you are traveling often and looking for an easy way to encounter the local culture or you just want to communicate with people whose language you don’t understand, then you should install Ablo and start making friends around the world.

## The Most Popular Apps of 2024 on Google Play

Smartphones bring entertainment to the palms of our hands and grant us instant access to information that makes our lives easier. Over the course of 2024 apps from a broad range of categories have sparked the interest of thousands of Android users. Here are some of the most popular apps of 2024 that can help you improve your productivity or make better fashion choices.

### 1\. [Peloton](https://play.google.com/store/apps/details?id=com.onepeloton.callisto&hl=en)

**Price:**Free, but offers in-app purchases

**Supported OS:**Requires Android 5.1 or up

**Category:**Health & Fitness

![InShot Video Editor - Glitch Video Effects ](https://images.wondershare.com/filmora/article-images/peloton-most-popular-app-android.jpg)

Leading a healthy lifestyle is much easier if you have the assistance of the world’s leading instructors. If you already own a Peloton bike or tread, then you can enjoy all the benefits of the Peloton app for free. Yoga, cardio or indoor cycling are just a few among numerous types of classes you can attend through this Android app. In addition, you can also broadcast your workouts through the Peloton’s Chromecast support and share your daily workout routines with thousands of followers. Even so, the app’s interface is somewhat outdated and the app crashes easily during workouts, which makes using Peloton frequently a bit difficult.

### 2\. [21 Buttons](https://play.google.com/store/apps/details?id=com.android21buttons&hl=en)

If you opt for one of the available subscription models you will have an unlimited amount of learning time at your disposal.
