<p>Watching the time pass by in front of our eyes is mesmerizing. The fast forwarded scenes of beautiful sunsets, busy streets and all other types of vistas can be found anywhere from Holywood movies to YouTube videos. You don’t need professional camera equipment if you want to create time-lapse videos you can share on your social media accounts because there are plenty of apps that let you create these types of videos directly from your Smartphones. So, in this article, we are going to introduce you to some of the best time-lapse apps for iPhone and Android devices in 2020.</p>
<h2 id="Best-Time-Lapse-Apps-for-Android-and-iPhone-Devices-in-2021"><a href="#Best-Time-Lapse-Apps-for-Android-and-iPhone-Devices-in-2021" class="headerlink" title="Best Time-Lapse Apps for Android and iPhone Devices in 2021"></a>Best Time-Lapse Apps for Android and iPhone Devices in 2021</h2><p>The quality of your time-lapse video doesn’t depend only on the number of tools an app offers, which is why you must do everything in your power to record the footage that doesn’t contain camera shakes or any other common mistakes. With that being said, let’s take a look at the five best time-lapse apps you can find on GooglePlay or on the AppStore.</p>
<h4 id="1-Microsoft-Hyperlapse-Mobile"><a href="#1-Microsoft-Hyperlapse-Mobile" class="headerlink" title="1. Microsoft Hyperlapse Mobile"></a>1. <a class="link"   target="_blank" rel="noopener" href="https://play.google.com/store/apps/details?id=com.microsoft.hyperlapsemobile&hl=en" >Microsoft Hyperlapse Mobile <i class="fa-regular fa-arrow-up-right-from-square fa-sm"></i></a></h4><p><strong>Price:</strong> Free</p>
<p><strong>Compatibility:</strong> Android 4.4 or later</p>
<p><strong>Rating:</strong> 4.2</p>
<p>This Android-based application makes the creation of time-lapse videos look easy. You just have to select the speed at which you want to record a video, choose between 720p and 1080p resolutions and hit the record button. The app lets you increase the video’s speed up to 32 times, enabling you to create seamless time-lapses, although the video stabilization feature is only available if you’re recording a video at a normal speed. That is why you must ensure that your phone is perfectly stable while the recording is in progress if you want to create a smooth time-lapse.
