#### **Difference between Rewind and Reverse:**

#### **Reverse:**

The word reverse as the name reflects, means that we can play a video from its end towards the initial position. Yes, it is possible to reverse the order of video frames in order to arrange them in such a way that last frame appears first following the reverse sequence so that first frame goes to the last position in the clip.

#### **Rewind:**

On the other side rewind is also an interesting feature for video editing where users simply duplicate the clip in form of a segment or make adjustments over range selection and then rewind that particular segment at a speed many times faster than the original speed of clip. After this they play segment of original clip in normal speed towards forward direction.

Although it is possible to get the rewind effect in videos with simple reverse option but still Apple platform supports both of these as standalone options.

## How to reverse a clip in Final Cut Pro

#### Conclusion

If I were someone looking for a **cheap video editor to get jobs done** and really **can't be bothered to learn** everything about a new video editor, I'll go for **Filmora.** This software fits the appetite of **beginners** and **intermediate users**. You definitely can find better software for a higher price on the market, but before buying, ask yourself this question 'Can I spend hours focusing on learning a new hard software？Do I really need that many high-end functions to get things done?'
