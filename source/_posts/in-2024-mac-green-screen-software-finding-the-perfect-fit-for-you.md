 Mar 27, 2024• Proven solutions

Finding effective ways to [promote the videos](https://tools.techidaily.com/wondershare/filmora/download/) you create is almost as important as the quality of the movies you make. A movie trailer is probably one of the oldest marketing tools filmmakers use to advertise their upcoming projects. Nonetheless, you no longer need access to [professional video editing software](https://tools.techidaily.com/wondershare/filmora/download/) or advanced video editing skills to create a captivating video trailer, since [online video editing platforms](https://tools.techidaily.com/wondershare/filmora/download/) allow you to go through this process almost automatically.

That’s why in this article we are going to take you through some of the best online video trailer makers that enable you to make trailers for your videos with ease. So, let’s get started.

## Top 5 Online Video Trailer Makers

Making a trailer online shouldn’t be a complicated task since you just have to put a few video clips together and [add music to them](https://tools.techidaily.com/wondershare/filmora/download/). You just need to discover a creative way to [combine the footage](https://tools.techidaily.com/wondershare/filmora/download/) and the online video trailer makers we included in this article will do the rest for you. Here’s what the top five online video trailer makers have to offer.

**Price:** Free, pricing plans start at $19.00 per month

In case you are looking for an online platform that allows you to make Facebook ads, Instagram stories, promo videos or trailers, Biteable may be one of your best options. The platform grants you access to a huge library of templates that can be used for a broad range of purposes. You can choose from editorial, book and YouTube channel trailer templates or you can start a new project from scratch. Furthermore, Bitable lets you upload footage from social media or cloud storage services. You won’t be able to download finished projects if you opt for the free version of Biteable, and you can only share ten video trailers on social media each month. That’s why you must opt for one of the available subscription plans if you want to create video trailers with Bitable on a constant basis.

**Pros**

* Offers royalty-free music
* The platform offers a huge selection of stock footage

![motionden](https://images.wondershare.com/filmora/article-images/motionden.png)

**Price:** $9.00 per video

MotionDen enables social media marketers and all other video content creators who publish their work online to create new videos effortlessly. The video templates you can find on this platform are organized into categories such as Ads, Instagram or Fashion which helps you avoid browsing through hundreds of templates searching for the one you can use to create a video trailer. You must log in to your MotionDen account before you can start editing a template. So once you’re signed in, you just have to upload the photos or videos and add the text to the text boxes that are already included in the template you selected. Optionally, you can also use MotionDen’s stock audio or upload a song you would like to use as a soundtrack from your computer.

**Pros**

* No previous video editing experience required
* Customizing a template doesn’t take a lot of time
* Users can upload their own audio files
* Video trailers can be published to YouTube directly from MotionDen

**Cons**

**Price:** Free, $29.00 for a full HD video

This video editing platform allows you to create a broad range of different types of videos, as it offers whiteboard animation, explainer video or movie trailer templates, among numerous others. Creating an account on MakeWebVideo is the mandatory step you need to take before you can start working on a new movie trailer. You just have to upload the footage, insert up to 21 lines of text, apply the visual effects to your footage, and MakeWebVideo will do the rest for you. All test versions of video trailers are free, but if you want to download them in full HD resolution you must pay a $29.00 one-time fee. In return, the platform will offer the hosting services for the video trailer you created as well as the media player viewers can use to watch the trailer.

**Pros**

* A new video trailer can be generated in less than 15 minutes

**Price:** Free, pricing plans start at $9.99 per month

The process of creating a video trailer with Renderforest can be completed in just three simple steps. You just have to select a template, insert title scenes, videos, photos or logo animations and then decide if you want to publish the trailer on social media or download it to your computer. Renderforest grants you access to huge libraries of stock footage that are perfectly adjusted to the genre of the video trailer you select, which means that you don’t even need your own footage to create a trailer with this platform. Furthermore, you can also choose if you want to use the platform’s music library or upload the audio file you intend to use as a soundtrack for the video trailer you are making. It is worth noting that the free version of Renderforest doesn’t allow users to create videos that are longer than three minutes.

**Price:** Free

LightMV is a video content creation platform that allows its users to turn their photos into videos. Simply choose a template from Social Media, Fashion, or Travel categories and upload the images to the template. The number of images you can include in a video trailer varies from template to template, although you can purchase lollies, the platform’s virtual money, that enables you to increase the number of images you can add to a template. Even though all templates have built-in soundtracks, you can add a new song from the platform’s music library or from your computer. LightMV can be used from a web browser, installed as software on a PC computer or downloaded as an app from Google Play or App Store.

**Pros**

* LightMV offers an easy way to turn photos into videos
* All templates are easily customizable

Well, if you want to make a fully tailored trailer, I highly suggest you download Filmora with the buttons below. It definitely gives you the best value.

This web-based app makes converting JPEG files into MP4 video files a simple two-step process, that just requires you to upload photos and then choose the amount time between two images. The maximum number of photos you can use in a video is limited to just **twenty**, while the maximum duration of each image in the video can’t exceed the **20-second** mark. Adding transitions between pictures is also on the list of options this platform provides, but Mp3 Care Photo to Video lacks any other video editing features. Despite some obvious downsides, this online photo to video maker is still a great option if you want to convert your photos into videos quickly and free of charge.

#### 7. [Kizoa](https://www.kizoa.com/home)

**Price:** Free, Subscription plans start at $29.99

Kizoa is an online video editor that lets you turn your photos in your videos, so you just have to choose the images you want to use in your project and upload them to the platform. Furthermore, even the free version of the app lets you store up to **1GB** of photos and videos, which makes accessing your footage even easier. Nonetheless, the free version of Kizoa only allows you to export videos **shorter than two minutes** and you **must** **purchase** one of the available subscription plans **in order to be able to export** videos that last more than **ten minutes** or to create 4K videos.

#### 8. [Movie Maker Online](https://moviemakeronline.com/)

**Price:** Free

![ Image to Video online maker ](https://images.wondershare.com/filmora/article-images/image-to-video-online-movie-maker-online.jpg)

If you don’t already have the photos you want to use in your video, the Movie Maker Online is an excellent choice for you, because the platform offers a rich selection of royalty free images. Additionally, you also use Movie Maker Online to search for free music you can use in your videos without having to worry about the copyrights. The platform’s interface, however, is far from perfect and it may take you some time to get used to it and figure out how to add text to the photos you’re using in your video or how to choose for how long a photo is going to be displayed on the screen.

#### 9. [Slideshow Photos](https://slideshow.photos/)

**Price:** Free

![ Image to Video online maker ](https://images.wondershare.com/filmora/article-images/slide-show-online-image-to-video-online.jpg)

You can create professional slideshows with this web-based app in a few easy steps, as you just have to select one out of four available templates and then upload at least 27 photos. Once you finish uploading the images, you can proceed to add text to your slideshow and then click on the Create a Slideshow button. The platform will then ask for your email address and it will send you an email that informs you that your video is going to be ready **in 11 hours unless you want to pay $4 to speed up the delivery time**.

#### 10. [PhotoShow](http://www.photoshow.com/home/start)

**Price:** Free version available, subscription plans start at $2.49 per month

![ Image to Video online maker ](https://images.wondershare.com/filmora/article-images/image-to-video-online.jpg)

 PhotoShow lets you create slideshows in three easy steps. After you upload the photos you want to use in a slideshow, you can preview the results and customize them in accordance with your demands and then you can share the slideshow. However, you will have to install the latest version of Adobe’s Flash Player in order to use this platform, so make sure that this software is updated before you start creating a new slideshow with it. If you choose one of the subscription plans, you will be able to enhance each photo you include in your slideshow, before you export it to social media.

#### 11. [Adobe Spark](https://spark.adobe.com/make/slideshow-maker/)

**Price:** Free, Available through Adobe Creative Cloud Plan for $52.99 per month or as a stand-alone app for $9.99 per month

In order to start using Adobe Spark, you will first have to use your Google or Facebook account to sign in to your Adobe account. Furthermore, the free version of Adobe Spark offers only a limited amount of photo and video editing options. If you would like to gain access to premium features such as adding a logo or choosing the font of the text you would like to use in your slideshows, you will either have to purchase Adobe Spark as a stand-alone app or as a part of the Adobe’s Creative Cloud Plan. Creating a slideshow with Adobe Spark is remarkably easy since you just have to insert the text, pick a template and upload the photos you would like to add to the slideshow.

---

#### **Conclusion**

Turning your photos into awe-inspiring videos has never been so simple because you no longer need to have access to expensive professional video editing software products to create videos. Instead, you can produce videos from photos using the online image to video makers that enable you to generate videos in just a few easy steps.
