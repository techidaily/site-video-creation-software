However, the size is not only meant by the dimensions. Resolution and aspect ratio are also equally important for having the perfect size of the video and images. When you talk about the videos, the best dimension and resolution is considered to be 1080 by 1920p. Similarly, the aspect ratio for these videos is 16:When you create short video on YouTube then this youtube <strong>shorts aspect ratio</strong> remains the same because videos in this resolution and aspect ratio perform the best as they are in full HD.</p>
<p>Talking about videos, YouTube images cannot be neglected. If you will not follow the recommended size of YouTube images then you may have to face issues in posting them. YouTube images are at best when they are posted in the perfect size. Banner images on YouTube must be posted in the size of 2560 by 1440 pixels. Size of images may also change depending on the device that you are using. This can be different on desktops and tablets accordingly. On desktops, the size is 2560 by 423 and on tablets, the size becomes 1855 by 423.</p>

This is so important because without frame rate your video will not get the desired quality. It is must to know thing that video which you are posting must be in the actual and same frame rate in which it has been recorded. The most common frame rates for YouTube videos are 24, 48, 30, 25 and 60. However you can post the videos in any other frame rate but these are recommended the most.</p>
<p>It is equally important to deinterlace the content before you are posting it. This means if your video has 1080i60p and you want to convert it into 1080i30p then you will need to change the frame rate first.</p>

<p>First, let’s talk about what Ken Burns is and why he has an effect named after him in Final Cut programs!</p>
<h3 id="What-is-the-Ken-Burns-Effect"><a href="#What-is-the-Ken-Burns-Effect" class="headerlink" title="What is the Ken Burns Effect"></a>What is the Ken Burns Effect</h3><p><a class="link"   target="_blank" rel="noopener" href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Ken%5FBurns%5Feffect" >Ken Burns <i class="fa-regular fa-arrow-up-right-from-square fa-sm"></i></a> is a world-famous American documentary filmmaker. He is well known for producing documentaries that take a candid if somewhat old-world-feeling look into different worlds. He has covered Baseball, the Civil War, and other fascinating times and places. Arguably, he is best known for using archival footage as film footage. How does he do this? By using the Ken Burns Effect, of course.</p>
<p>The Ken Burns Effect in Final Cut Pro X allows the editor to zoom in and out, slow pan, and scroll across archive photography and still film. This will enable you to substitute whole parts of the program you are making with photographs if you haven’t taken enough footage. It is commonly used in editing, particularly when making things like <a class="link"   target="_blank" rel="noopener" href="https://tools.techidaily.com/wondershare/filmora/download/" >wedding videos <i class="fa-regular fa-arrow-up-right-from-square fa-sm"></i></a>, which often feature lots of photos of the happy couple.</p>

Let’s go over the steps to making the Ken Burns Effect in Final Cut Pro.</p>
<p><strong>Step 1</strong> – Import your video. From your timeline workspace, select the clip, or highlight the section of the clip, that you want to apply the Ken Burns Effect to.</p>

<p><strong>Step 2</strong> – Enter into the viewer mode to do this. From here, select the pop-up menu from the list of options at the bottom of the screen.</p>
<p><strong>Step 3</strong> – Hold down both the shift key and the letter C. This is the fast way to cut out what you need. You can always stick to the right-click to cut a clip if you are more comfortable with this.</p>
<p><strong>Step 4</strong> – scroll down until you find the Ken Burns Effect option in the control panel. The effect should now appear on your page, in the area you selected.</p>
<h3 id="Ken-Burns-Customization"><a href="#Ken-Burns-Customization" class="headerlink" title="Ken Burns Customization"></a>Ken Burns Customization</h3><p>You can also customize the ken burns effects in Final Cut.</p>
<p><strong>Step 1</strong> – To transform from the Ken Burns Effect into customization mode, drag the green box in the viewer.</p>

<p><strong>Step 4</strong> – Adjust the viewer to accommodate any changes you need to make – don’t click the done button until you are sure. That being said, you can always back-step should you mis-click. You can also just start over with the effect customization if you messed up.</p>

Let’s examine how we zoom in Final Cut Pro using keyframing. Keyframing, of course, involves <a class="link"   target="_blank" rel="noopener" href="https://tools.techidaily.com/wondershare/filmora/download/" >basic animation <i class="fa-regular fa-arrow-up-right-from-square fa-sm"></i></a> that allows movement to be added to a still frame. So how do you use the Ken Burns Effect in Final Cut Pro X in conjunction with keyframing? Let’s talk you through it.</p>
<p>You can use keyframing to zoom and pan. We will talk you through how you use it to zoom in, and you should be able to work out the rest from there.</p>
<p><strong>Step 1</strong> – Set the playhead at the start of the chosen clip. This is where you want the zoom effect to start from.</p>
<p><strong>Step 2</strong> – Click to select the effects menu. It should be at the bottom of the screen.</p>
<p><strong>Step 3</strong> – Seek out the scale and position tools. You can use these to size your animation, decide how much of a zoom you like, and how fast it will go.</p>
<p><img

                ></p>
<p><strong>Step 4</strong> – Follow keyframe &gt; size &gt; position and ensure your clip is covered as you need it. You can always come back to this step a few times if you don’t get it immediately right.</p>
<p><strong>Step 5</strong> – Set the playhead where you want the clip and animation to end. Remember – if you zoom or pan too fast, you might glitch in your footage. Do it on time for the best results.</p>
<p><strong>As a Pro Tip</strong>: you will be baled to view all keyframes on your clip if you select show video animation from your timeline.</p>
<h2 id="The-Ken-Burns-Conclusion"><a href="#The-Ken-Burns-Conclusion" class="headerlink" title="The Ken Burns Conclusion"></a>The Ken Burns Conclusion</h2><p>The Ken Burns Effect is famous for a reason. It allows you to fill up space if you don’t have footage for certain things. It can be used to depict ancient battles without the use of CGI.</p>
<p>The Ken Burns Effect, Final Cut Pro (X) technique lets filmmakers go to places that they wouldn’t otherwise get to. It is excellent for both glimpsing into the past, and for flashing forward into imagined futures. Best of all, it lets you go there when you aren’t a big-budget Hollywood film producer.

This will enable you to substitute whole parts of the program you are making with photographs if you haven’t taken enough footage. It is commonly used in editing, particularly when making things like <a class="link"   target="_blank" rel="noopener" href="https://tools.techidaily.com/wondershare/filmora/download/" >wedding videos <i class="fa-regular fa-arrow-up-right-from-square fa-sm"></i></a>, which often feature lots of photos of the happy couple.</p>
<p>Anyway, let’s look at how you implement the Ken Burns Effect in Final Cut Pro.</p>
<h3 id="Steps-to-Making-the-Ken-Burns-Effect-Final-Cut-Pro-3"><a href="#Steps-to-Making-the-Ken-Burns-Effect-Final-Cut-Pro-3" class="headerlink" title="Steps to Making the Ken Burns Effect Final Cut Pro"></a>Steps to Making the Ken Burns Effect Final Cut Pro</h3><p>Now that we know what is Ken Burns Effect. Let’s go over the steps to making the Ken Burns Effect in Final Cut Pro.</p>
<p><strong>Step 1</strong> – Import your video. From your timeline workspace, select the clip, or highlight the section of the clip, that you want to apply the Ken Burns Effect to.</p>
<p><img  
                     lazyload
                     src="/images/loading.svg"
                     data-src="https://images.wondershare.com/filmora/filmorapro/import-media-final-cut-pro.JPG"
                      alt="import media"
                ></p>
<p><strong>Step 2</strong> – Enter into the viewer mode to do this. From here, select the pop-up menu from the list of options at the bottom of the screen.</p>
<p><strong>Step 3</strong> – Hold down both the shift key and the letter C. This is the fast way to cut out what you need. You can always stick to the right-click to cut a clip if you are more comfortable with this.</p>
<p><strong>Step 4</strong> – scroll down until you find the Ken Burns Effect option in the control panel. The effect should now appear on your page, in the area you selected.</p>
<h3 id="Ken-Burns-Customization-3"><a href="#Ken-Burns-Customization-3" class="headerlink" title="Ken Burns Customization"></a>Ken Burns Customization</h3><p>You can also customize the ken burns effects in Final Cut.</p>
<p><strong>Step 1</strong> – To transform from the Ken Burns Effect into customization mode, drag the green box in the viewer.</p>
<p><strong>Step 2</strong> – Adjust the green box’s size, shape, and height until you are happy with where it is placed.</p>
<p><img  
                     lazyload
                     src="/images/loading.svg"
                     data-src="https://images.wondershare.com/filmora/filmorapro/customize-ken-burns-effects-box.JPG"
                      alt="customize ken burns effects"
                ></p>
<p><strong>Step 3</strong> – Checking what you have already put in place using the preview option is a good idea at this stage. You can edit mistakes out later, but when you are trying to edit for speed, it is best to get it right the first time around!</p>
<p><strong>Step 4</strong> – Adjust the viewer to accommodate any changes you need to make – don’t click the done button until you are sure. That being said, you can always back-step should you mis-click. You can also just start over with the effect customization if you messed up.</p>
<h2 id="Part-2-How-to-Zoom-in-Final-Cut-Pro-Using-Keyframing-3"><a href="#Part-2-How-to-Zoom-in-Final-Cut-Pro-Using-Keyframing-3" class="headerlink" title="Part 2: How to Zoom in Final Cut Pro Using Keyframing"></a>Part 2: How to Zoom in Final Cut Pro Using Keyframing</h2><p>Now that we know how to open and apply the Ken Burns Effect in Final Cut Pro. Let’s examine how we zoom in Final Cut Pro using keyframing. Keyframing, of course, involves <a class="link"   target="_blank" rel="noopener" href="https://tools.techidaily.com/wondershare/filmora/download/" >basic animation <i class="fa-regular fa-arrow-up-right-from-square fa-sm"></i></a> that allows movement to be added to a still frame. So how do you use the Ken Burns Effect in Final Cut Pro X in conjunction with keyframing? Let’s talk you through it.</p>
<p>You can use keyframing to zoom and pan. We will talk you through how you use it to zoom in, and you should be able to work out the rest from there.</p>
<p><strong>Step 1</strong> – Set the playhead at the start of the chosen clip. This is where you want the zoom effect to start from.</p>
<p><strong>Step 2</strong> – Click to select the effects menu. It should be at the bottom of the screen.</p>
<p><strong>Step 3</strong> – Seek out the scale and position tools. You can use these to size your animation, decide how much of a zoom you like, and how fast it will go.</p>
<p><img  
                     lazyload
                     src="/images/loading.svg"
                     data-src="https://images.wondershare.com/filmora/filmorapro/scale-and-position-final-cut.jpg"
                      alt="scale and position"
                ></p>
<p><strong>Step 4</strong> – Follow keyframe &gt; size &gt; position and ensure your clip is covered as you need it. You can always come back to this step a few times if you don’t get it immediately right.</p>
<p><strong>Step 5</strong> – Set the playhead where you want the clip and animation to end. Remember – if you zoom or pan too fast, you might glitch in your footage. Do it on time for the best results.</p>
<p><strong>As a Pro Tip</strong>: you will be baled to view all keyframes on your clip if you select show video animation from your timeline.</p>
<h2 id="The-Ken-Burns-Conclusion-3"><a href="#The-Ken-Burns-Conclusion-3" class="headerlink" title="The Ken Burns Conclusion"></a>The Ken Burns Conclusion</h2><p>The Ken Burns Effect is famous for a reason. It allows you to fill up space if you don’t have footage for certain things. It can be used to depict ancient battles without the use of CGI.</p>
<p>The Ken Burns Effect, Final Cut Pro (X) technique lets filmmakers go to places that they wouldn’t otherwise get to. It is excellent for both glimpsing into the past, and for flashing forward into imagined futures. Best of all, it lets you go there when you aren’t a big-budget Hollywood film producer. We love anything that saves a buck or two while we edit.</p>

<p>So let’s review some basics on pixel calculator ratio to create an easy life, your workflow more productive, and your photos of the ideal size for the intended purpose.</p>

<h2 id="Part-1-What-is-Pixel-Aspect-Ratio"><a href="#Part-1-What-is-Pixel-Aspect-Ratio" class="headerlink" title="Part 1 What is Pixel Aspect Ratio?"></a>Part 1 What is Pixel Aspect Ratio?</h2><p>A digital image is not a single non-dividable thing. You’ll see that your photo is like a mosaic formed by small tiles if you zoom in far enough, which are known as pixels in photography.</p>
<p>The amount of these pixels and the way they are divided are the two elements that you’re required to take into account to know more about the resolution and <strong>pixel</strong> <strong>calculator ratio</strong>.</p>
<p>The Pixel Aspect Ratio is simply the latest way of defining the length of one side of a pixel in context to the length of the other.</p>
<p>Let’s say the ratio is 1:1; each side of the pixel is the same length as the other, also known as a square in pixels.</p>
<p>If the ratio is 2:1, it means that one side is twice the length of the other.</p>
<p><strong>NOTE</strong>: The ‘Aspect Ratio’ does not define the actual or exact length of the side of a pixel is, just its “relative” size of one side to the other. The actual length will depend on how much you shrink or stretch a photo when recreating it. But if the <strong>Pixel Calculator Ratio</strong> is 1:1, then the pixels will always be square irrespective of the size of that particular photo.</p>

So, we’d like to suggest a calculator by xwebtools.com.</p>
<p>Here, you can see tabs, namely the <strong>Common Ratios</strong> <strong>Ratio Width</strong>, <strong>Ratio Height</strong>, <strong>Pixels Width</strong>, and <strong>Pixels Height</strong>.</p>
<p><img  
                     lazyload
                     src="/images/loading.svg"

                      alt="xwebtools pixel ratio calculator"
                ></p>
<p><strong>How it works:</strong></p>
<p>This <strong>pixel ratio calculator</strong> converts pixel dimensions to aspect ratios. It is an online free tool that assists you in calculating the aspect ratio value of an object or a photo.</p>
<p>The conversion can be carried in both ways, aspect ratio to pixels and pixels to aspect ratio. This screen resolution calculator offers a powerful and simple tool that can convert the ratio of images to pixels resolution and pixels to ratio dimensions.</p>
<p>You need to provide Pixels Width and Pixels Height to calculate the aspect ratio; the aspect ratio will be automatically calculated.</p>
<p>You need to provide Ratio Height and Ratio Width to calculate pixel resolutions. Both the Pixels Width and Height will get automatically calculated.</p>
<h2 id="Part-3-What-is-Par-pixel-Aspect-Ratio-in-Adobe-Premiere-Pro-Filmora"><a href="#Part-3-What-is-Par-pixel-Aspect-Ratio-in-Adobe-Premiere-Pro-Filmora" class="headerlink" title="Part 3 What is Par (pixel Aspect Ratio) in Adobe Premiere Pro&#x2F;Filmora?"></a>Part 3 What is Par (pixel Aspect Ratio) in Adobe Premiere Pro&#x2F;Filmora?</h2><p><strong>Pixel ratio: Adobe Premiere Pro</strong></p>
<p>As we already discussed, an aspect ratio defines width to height. The still picture and video frames have a frame aspect ratio. The pixels that create the frame have a pixel aspect ratio (sometimes called PAR).</p>
<p>Different video recording standards have different aspect ratios. For instance, you record video for television in either a 16:9 or a 4:3 frame aspect ratio.</p>
<p>You set the frame and pixel aspect when you create a project in Adobe Premiere Pro. Once you set these ratios, you can’t change them for that project. However, you can edit the aspect ratio of a sequence. You can also use assets made with different aspect ratios in the project.</p>
<p>Premiere Pro automatically compensates for the pixel aspect ratio of source files.</p>
<p>If an asset still feels distorted, you can manually mention its pixel aspect ratio. But that isn’t very clear, especially for a beginner. This is why we recommend doing the following.</p>
<p><strong>Pixel ratio: Wondershare Filmora</strong></p>
<p>You need a converter or a video editor to change the aspect ratio permanently. Here we humbly recommend an excellent aspect ratio changer - <a class="link"   target="_blank" rel="noopener" href="https://tools.techidaily.com/wondershare/filmora/download/" >Wondershare Filmora <i class="fa-regular fa-arrow-up-right-from-square fa-sm"></i></a> video editor, which helps you make 4:3, 9:16, 16:9, and 1:1 aspect ratio videos pretty quickly.</p>

<p>Thus, using the Wondershare Filmora along with the <strong>pixel ratio calculator</strong> makes a difference!</p>
<h2 id="Part-4-Difference-among-Pixel-Aspect-Ratio-Display-Aspect-Ratio-and-Storage-Aspect-Ratio"><a href="#Part-4-Difference-among-Pixel-Aspect-Ratio-Display-Aspect-Ratio-and-Storage-Aspect-Ratio" class="headerlink" title="Part 4 Difference among Pixel Aspect Ratio, Display Aspect Ratio, and Storage Aspect Ratio"></a>Part 4 Difference among Pixel Aspect Ratio, Display Aspect Ratio, and Storage Aspect Ratio</h2><p>Although the image aspect ratio comes from its width and height, it also contains multiple subsets that help to define image proportions properly.</p>
<p>1 - <strong>Pixel aspect ratio</strong></p>
<p>Pixel aspect ratio (PAR) is the proportion of the specific pixels within an image. They are generally square within the pixel aspect ratio of 1:1.</p>
<p>But sometimes, specific images are optimized for certain types of displays. And, they have rectangular pixels with an aspect ratio of 4:3 or similar.</p>
<p>2 - <strong>Display aspect ratio</strong></p>
<p>The display aspect ratio (DAR) is the designers’ most frequent aspect ratio and gets generally synced with the general term.</p>
<p>As the name suggests, the display aspect ratio refers to the proportions of an image as it appears on different screens out there.</p>
<p>Some devices, such as televisions and cameras, have a fixed DAR for images to display nicely on these devices.</p>
<p>They need optimization for their specific or respective aspect ratio. For instance, a typical display aspect ratio for the widescreen video on a television screen or monitor screen is 16:9.</p>
<p>They appear distorted when images with different aspect ratios are presented on these devices. Digital SLR camera sensors also consist of a fixed display aspect ratio, which controls how pictures captured by the camera will be displayed and saved.</p>
<p>3 - <strong>Storage aspect ratio</strong></p>
<p>Storage aspect ratio, commonly known as (SAR) is an aspect ratio formula that concerns specifically to encoded digital video files. SAR refers to the height and the width relationship in video frame size, and it is required to be consistent among all individual frames.</p>
<p>SAR x PAR &#x3D; DAR for max widescreen videos in a usual used formula.</p>
<h2 id="Part-1-Part-5-How-Aspect-Ratios-Affect-UI-UX-Design"><a href="#Part-1-Part-5-How-Aspect-Ratios-Affect-UI-UX-Design" class="headerlink" title="Part 1 Part 5: How Aspect Ratios Affect UI&#x2F;UX Design?"></a>Part 1 Part 5: How Aspect Ratios Affect UI&#x2F;UX Design?</h2><p>Aspect ratios play a vital part in any project that consists of displaying and capturing photographs, videos, or other image-based files in an ideal manner. The camera’s fixed aspect ratio can considerably impact, especially for photographers.</p>
<p>And for videographers or anyone working with slideshows, animations, and other motion projects, the aspect ratio is a prominent element for correct display on mobile devices and widescreen.</p>
<p>But even in the environment of responsive web design, problems can arise, such as when an image is not adjustable for display without compromising its quality or content.</p>
<p>A small example is when you need a square image with a 1:1 aspect ratio to insert into a rectangular box on a web page. To accommodate varying image size requirements, proportions and size may need adjustment.</p>
<p>In an increasingly picture-driven digital world, videos and images that look even slightly out of the way add to a visitor’s negative impression of a site. Besides those forced into the wrong configurations can even interfere with a site’s usability.</p>
<p>Poorly proportioned user guide or product images video that’s too stretched to check clearly can affect both a visitor’s want and their ability to use the site. Developers, designers, and anyone working with images will need to know how aspect ratios work and manipulate them for the best visual effect.</p>
<p>Various <strong>pixel calculator ratios</strong>, both paid and free, have popped up on the web to streamline the process.</p>

<p>Let’s say the ratio is 1:1; each side of the pixel is the same length as the other, also known as a square in pixels.</p>
<p>If the ratio is 2:1, it means that one side is twice the length of the other.</p>
<p><strong>NOTE</strong>: The ‘Aspect Ratio’ does not define the actual or exact length of the side of a pixel is, just its “relative” size of one side to the other. The actual length will depend on how much you shrink or stretch a photo when recreating it. But if the <strong>Pixel Calculator Ratio</strong> is 1:1, then the pixels will always be square irrespective of the size of that particular photo.</p>

<p><strong>How it works:</strong></p>
<p>This <strong>pixel ratio calculator</strong> converts pixel dimensions to aspect ratios. It is an online free tool that assists you in calculating the aspect ratio value of an object or a photo.</p>
<p>The conversion can be carried in both ways, aspect ratio to pixels and pixels to aspect ratio. This screen resolution calculator offers a powerful and simple tool that can convert the ratio of images to pixels resolution and pixels to ratio dimensions.</p>
<p>You need to provide Pixels Width and Pixels Height to calculate the aspect ratio; the aspect ratio will be automatically calculated.</p>
<p>You need to provide Ratio Height and Ratio Width to calculate pixel resolutions. Both the Pixels Width and Height will get automatically calculated.</p>

<p>As we already discussed, an aspect ratio defines width to height. The still picture and video frames have a frame aspect ratio. The pixels that create the frame have a pixel aspect ratio (sometimes called PAR).</p>
<p>Different video recording standards have different aspect ratios. For instance, you record video for television in either a 16:9 or a 4:3 frame aspect ratio.</p>
<p>You set the frame and pixel aspect when you create a project in Adobe Premiere Pro. Once you set these ratios, you can’t change them for that project. However, you can edit the aspect ratio of a sequence. You can also use assets made with different aspect ratios in the project.</p>
<p>Premiere Pro automatically compensates for the pixel aspect ratio of source files.</p>
<p>If an asset still feels distorted, you can manually mention its pixel aspect ratio. But that isn’t very clear, especially for a beginner. This is why we recommend doing the following.</p>

<p>Thus, using the Wondershare Filmora along with the <strong>pixel ratio calculator</strong> makes a difference!</p>
<h2 id="Part-4-Difference-among-Pixel-Aspect-Ratio-Display-Aspect-Ratio-and-Storage-Aspect-Ratio-1"><a href="#Part-4-Difference-among-Pixel-Aspect-Ratio-Display-Aspect-Ratio-and-Storage-Aspect-Ratio-1" class="headerlink" title="Part 4 Difference among Pixel Aspect Ratio, Display Aspect Ratio, and Storage Aspect Ratio"></a>Part 4 Difference among Pixel Aspect Ratio, Display Aspect Ratio, and Storage Aspect Ratio</h2><p>Although the image aspect ratio comes from its width and height, it also contains multiple subsets that help to define image proportions properly.</p>
<p>1 - <strong>Pixel aspect ratio</strong></p>
<p>Pixel aspect ratio (PAR) is the proportion of the specific pixels within an image. They are generally square within the pixel aspect ratio of 1:1.</p>
<p>But sometimes, specific images are optimized for certain types of displays. And, they have rectangular pixels with an aspect ratio of 4:3 or similar.</p>
<p>2 - <strong>Display aspect ratio</strong></p>
<p>The display aspect ratio (DAR) is the designers’ most frequent aspect ratio and gets generally synced with the general term.</p>
<p>As the name suggests, the display aspect ratio refers to the proportions of an image as it appears on different screens out there.</p>
<p>Some devices, such as televisions and cameras, have a fixed DAR for images to display nicely on these devices.</p>
<p>They need optimization for their specific or respective aspect ratio. For instance, a typical display aspect ratio for the widescreen video on a television screen or monitor screen is 16:9.</p>
<p>They appear distorted when images with different aspect ratios are presented on these devices. Digital SLR camera sensors also consist of a fixed display aspect ratio, which controls how pictures captured by the camera will be displayed and saved.</p>
<p>3 - <strong>Storage aspect ratio</strong></p>
<p>Storage aspect ratio, commonly known as (SAR) is an aspect ratio formula that concerns specifically to encoded digital video files. SAR refers to the height and the width relationship in video frame size, and it is required to be consistent among all individual frames.</p>
<p>SAR x PAR &#x3D; DAR for max widescreen videos in a usual used formula.</p>
<h2 id="Part-1-Part-5-How-Aspect-Ratios-Affect-UI-UX-Design-1"><a href="#Part-1-Part-5-How-Aspect-Ratios-Affect-UI-UX-Design-1" class="headerlink" title="Part 1 Part 5: How Aspect Ratios Affect UI&#x2F;UX Design?"></a>Part 1 Part 5: How Aspect Ratios Affect UI&#x2F;UX Design?</h2><p>Aspect ratios play a vital part in any project that consists of displaying and capturing photographs, videos, or other image-based files in an ideal manner. The camera’s fixed aspect ratio can considerably impact, especially for photographers.</p>
<p>And for videographers or anyone working with slideshows, animations, and other motion projects, the aspect ratio is a prominent element for correct display on mobile devices and widescreen.</p>
<p>But even in the environment of responsive web design, problems can arise, such as when an image is not adjustable for display without compromising its quality or content.</p>
<p>A small example is when you need a square image with a 1:1 aspect ratio to insert into a rectangular box on a web page. To accommodate varying image size requirements, proportions and size may need adjustment.</p>
<p>In an increasingly picture-driven digital world, videos and images that look even slightly out of the way add to a visitor’s negative impression of a site. Besides those forced into the wrong configurations can even interfere with a site’s usability.</p>
<p>Poorly proportioned user guide or product images video that’s too stretched to check clearly can affect both a visitor’s want and their ability to use the site. Developers, designers, and anyone working with images will need to know how aspect ratios work and manipulate them for the best visual effect.</p>
<p>Various <strong>pixel calculator ratios</strong>, both paid and free, have popped up on the web to streamline the process.</p>

<p>1 - <strong>Pixel aspect ratio</strong></p>
<p>Pixel aspect ratio (PAR) is the proportion of the specific pixels within an image. They are generally square within the pixel aspect ratio of 1:1.</p>
<p>But sometimes, specific images are optimized for certain types of displays. And, they have rectangular pixels with an aspect ratio of 4:3 or similar.</p>
<p>2 - <strong>Display aspect ratio</strong></p>
<p>The display aspect ratio (DAR) is the designers’ most frequent aspect ratio and gets generally synced with the general term.</p>
<p>As the name suggests, the display aspect ratio refers to the proportions of an image as it appears on different screens out there.</p>
<p>Some devices, such as televisions and cameras, have a fixed DAR for images to display nicely on these devices.</p>
<p>They need optimization for their specific or respective aspect ratio. For instance, a typical display aspect ratio for the widescreen video on a television screen or monitor screen is 16:9.</p>
<p>They appear distorted when images with different aspect ratios are presented on these devices. Digital SLR camera sensors also consist of a fixed display aspect ratio, which controls how pictures captured by the camera will be displayed and saved.</p>
<p>3 - <strong>Storage aspect ratio</strong></p>
<p>Storage aspect ratio, commonly known as (SAR) is an aspect ratio formula that concerns specifically to encoded digital video files. SAR refers to the height and the width relationship in video frame size, and it is required to be consistent among all individual frames.</p>
<p>SAR x PAR &#x3D; DAR for max widescreen videos in a usual used formula.</p>
<h2 id="Part-1-Part-5-How-Aspect-Ratios-Affect-UI-UX-Design-2"><a href="#Part-1-Part-5-How-Aspect-Ratios-Affect-UI-UX-Design-2" class="headerlink" title="Part 1 Part 5: How Aspect Ratios Affect UI&#x2F;UX Design?"></a>Part 1 Part 5: How Aspect Ratios Affect UI&#x2F;UX Design?</h2><p>Aspect ratios play a vital part in any project that consists of displaying and capturing photographs, videos, or other image-based files in an ideal manner. The camera’s fixed aspect ratio can considerably impact, especially for photographers.</p>
<p>And for videographers or anyone working with slideshows, animations, and other motion projects, the aspect ratio is a prominent element for correct display on mobile devices and widescreen.</p>
<p>But even in the environment of responsive web design, problems can arise, such as when an image is not adjustable for display without compromising its quality or content.</p>
<p>A small example is when you need a square image with a 1:1 aspect ratio to insert into a rectangular box on a web page. To accommodate varying image size requirements, proportions and size may need adjustment.</p>
<p>In an increasingly picture-driven digital world, videos and images that look even slightly out of the way add to a visitor’s negative impression of a site. Besides those forced into the wrong configurations can even interfere with a site’s usability.</p>
<p>Poorly proportioned user guide or product images video that’s too stretched to check clearly can affect both a visitor’s want and their ability to use the site. Developers, designers, and anyone working with images will need to know how aspect ratios work and manipulate them for the best visual effect.</p>
<p>Various <strong>pixel calculator ratios</strong>, both paid and free, have popped up on the web to streamline the process.</p>

<h2 id="Part-1-What-is-Pixel-Aspect-Ratio-3"><a href="#Part-1-What-is-Pixel-Aspect-Ratio-3" class="headerlink" title="Part 1 What is Pixel Aspect Ratio?"></a>Part 1 What is Pixel Aspect Ratio?</h2><p>A digital image is not a single non-dividable thing. You’ll see that your photo is like a mosaic formed by small tiles if you zoom in far enough, which are known as pixels in photography.</p>
<p>The amount of these pixels and the way they are divided are the two elements that you’re required to take into account to know more about the resolution and <strong>pixel</strong> <strong>calculator ratio</strong>.</p>
<p>The Pixel Aspect Ratio is simply the latest way of defining the length of one side of a pixel in context to the length of the other.</p>
<p>Let’s say the ratio is 1:1; each side of the pixel is the same length as the other, also known as a square in pixels.</p>
<p>If the ratio is 2:1, it means that one side is twice the length of the other.</p>
<p><strong>NOTE</strong>: The ‘Aspect Ratio’ does not define the actual or exact length of the side of a pixel is, just its “relative” size of one side to the other. The actual length will depend on how much you shrink or stretch a photo when recreating it. But if the <strong>Pixel Calculator Ratio</strong> is 1:1, then the pixels will always be square irrespective of the size of that particular photo.</p>

So, we’d like to suggest a calculator by xwebtools.com.</p>
<p>Here, you can see tabs, namely the <strong>Common Ratios</strong> <strong>Ratio Width</strong>, <strong>Ratio Height</strong>, <strong>Pixels Width</strong>, and <strong>Pixels Height</strong>.</p>
<p><img  
                     lazyload

                      alt="xwebtools pixel ratio calculator"
                ></p>
<p><strong>How it works:</strong></p>
<p>This <strong>pixel ratio calculator</strong> converts pixel dimensions to aspect ratios. It is an online free tool that assists you in calculating the aspect ratio value of an object or a photo.</p>
<p>The conversion can be carried in both ways, aspect ratio to pixels and pixels to aspect ratio. This screen resolution calculator offers a powerful and simple tool that can convert the ratio of images to pixels resolution and pixels to ratio dimensions.</p>
<p>You need to provide Pixels Width and Pixels Height to calculate the aspect ratio; the aspect ratio will be automatically calculated.</p>
<p>You need to provide Ratio Height and Ratio Width to calculate pixel resolutions. Both the Pixels Width and Height will get automatically calculated.</p>
<h2 id="Part-3-What-is-Par-pixel-Aspect-Ratio-in-Adobe-Premiere-Pro-Filmora-3"><a href="#Part-3-What-is-Par-pixel-Aspect-Ratio-in-Adobe-Premiere-Pro-Filmora-3" class="headerlink" title="Part 3 What is Par (pixel Aspect Ratio) in Adobe Premiere Pro&#x2F;Filmora?"></a>Part 3 What is Par (pixel Aspect Ratio) in Adobe Premiere Pro&#x2F;Filmora?</h2><p><strong>Pixel ratio: Adobe Premiere Pro</strong></p>
<p>As we already discussed, an aspect ratio defines width to height. The still picture and video frames have a frame aspect ratio. The pixels that create the frame have a pixel aspect ratio (sometimes called PAR).</p>
<p>Different video recording standards have different aspect ratios. For instance, you record video for television in either a 16:9 or a 4:3 frame aspect ratio.</p>
<p>You set the frame and pixel aspect when you create a project in Adobe Premiere Pro. Once you set these ratios, you can’t change them for that project. However, you can edit the aspect ratio of a sequence. You can also use assets made with different aspect ratios in the project.</p>
<p>Premiere Pro automatically compensates for the pixel aspect ratio of source files.</p>
<p>If an asset still feels distorted, you can manually mention its pixel aspect ratio. But that isn’t very clear, especially for a beginner. This is why we recommend doing the following.</p>

<h4 id="1-Ocean-Footage-underwater-sample"><a href="#1-Ocean-Footage-underwater-sample" class="headerlink" title="1. Ocean Footage underwater sample"></a>1. Ocean Footage underwater sample</h4><p>This one is first on my choice of 4K video sample for a couple of reasons, firstly I love the subject matter, and secondly from a technical perspective it is one of the best samples out there.</p>
<p>Filmed using a Red One camera, it displays the vibrancy and detail that we associate with 4K resolution at its best, the color depth of the fish and coral is astounding, and when the shot moves to a passing whale the sense of scale the resolution gives really shows what 4K is capable of, and why it is a step up from anything we have seen before.</p>
<h4 id="2-Trailer-for-the-movie-‘Elysium’"><a href="#2-Trailer-for-the-movie-‘Elysium’" class="headerlink" title="2. Trailer for the movie ‘Elysium’"></a>2. Trailer for the movie ‘Elysium’</h4><p>Very little movie production footage is easily available out there in 4K, but this is one of the exceptions. The full theatrical trailer for the movie in glorious Ultra HD, Why does this make the list? Well I think if you are wanting to see the benefits of 4K, then samples like the Ocean Footage one mentioned above really show off the technical prowess, but it is actual movies that most people will be wanting to use 4K kit for, and this gives you a very good indication of how much of an increase in clarity, detail and vibrancy can be gained by switching to 4K. The standard HD version of this trailer is readily available too, so this is something you could make a direct comparison with. The nature of the film, a sci-fi action film, also lends itself to 4K with lots of beautifully rendered CGI scenes in the trailer to look at.</p>
<h3 id="3-Timescapes"><a href="#3-Timescapes" class="headerlink" title="3. Timescapes"></a>3. Timescapes</h3><p>This is the trailer for an interesting project, filmed entirely in 4K and the work of one man, it is purported to be the first 4K film made available for sale. The film itself, and this trailer, is a simple concept, slow-motion and time lapse cinematography of the South West of America, taken as the director, Tom Lowe, travels around in his pickup truck. The concept itself makes for an interesting effect, but this sample is here because of the content. Watching the big expanses of nature flow by in 4K is simply mind blowing, here you really see the almost 3D effect so much resolution and detail bring to the medium, it isn’t like watching a video, it really is like looking out of a window at real life.</p>
<h3 id="4-Boat-Scenes"><a href="#4-Boat-Scenes" class="headerlink" title="4. Boat Scenes"></a>4. Boat Scenes</h3><p>There are actually several test videos on this subject, all of them do a good job of displaying 4K but for me it is the this one that focuses on passing boats against an expansive backdrop that is the one to look at. Again it shows the effect of 4K resolution when displaying the wider world around us, this time a harbor vista as the boat passes through it, detail can be seen in the water, the passengers on the boat and the backdrop, and the sense of realism and scale, which for me are the things that set 4K apart, are readily apparent here.</p>

Tears of Steel trailer</h3><p>Another rare 4K movie trailer, this one again shows lots of very high quality CGI that really show off the capabilities of 4K at their best. Some great use of the depth of field that 4K emphasizes in a lot of the shots and overall provides a great insight into 4K and what you can expect from it. An interesting video that also manages to tell a little story as well as being a showcase.</p>
<h3 id="6-Sintel"><a href="#6-Sintel" class="headerlink" title="6. Sintel"></a>6. Sintel</h3><p>Sintel is an animated short created in the blender animation program, here in 4K it represents a fantastic look into what 4K can offer all forms of media, the opening scene, with the snow blowing in the wind, for instance, enables you to see incredible detail that just isn’t visible within the standard HD version. Seeing individual flies as the character searches through the wreckage of a town is another high point in terms of technical prowess.</p>
<p>Another feature of Sintel is its soft focus look that accentuates the high resolution, and makes this video stand out from others in the list. The small dragon is well animated and the main characters features, particularly the hair, are incredibly well realized. A great way to showcase your 4K equipment.</p>
<h3 id="7-Stock-Footage-Sample"><a href="#7-Stock-Footage-Sample" class="headerlink" title="7. Stock Footage Sample"></a>7. Stock Footage Sample</h3><p>This one is an amalgam of short clips from commercial stock footage that is used a sample of the product. That doesn’t make it any less of a fantastic 4K clip however, with footage chosen specifically to show off the benefits of 4K at its very best (it is a promotional package after all) there is something here for everyone. From the glorious colors of a sunrise to the explosions and the amazing time lapse, with, again, fantastic and vibrant colors, a real showcase for 4K in the true sense of the word.</p>
<h3 id="8-Honey-Bees"><a href="#8-Honey-Bees" class="headerlink" title="8. Honey Bees"></a>8. Honey Bees</h3><p>Back to nature for this one, and the eponymous Honey Bee. Showing not only the color rendition and detail of the surroundings, it also captures the Bees themselves in incredible fidelity, the wing detail, especially on the close-ups, is just way beyond anything we have seen from moving images before, high resolution stills? Certainly, but not video. Another great advert for 4K footage and a lovely film as well.</p>
<h4 id="9-Skyfall-Trailer"><a href="#9-Skyfall-Trailer" class="headerlink" title="9. Skyfall Trailer"></a>9. Skyfall Trailer</h4><p>Can’t say I’m much of a fan of the films, but as a way to see what very fast action looks like in 4K this is a great one. Unlike the other movie trailers, this one isn’t full of CGI, so it shows a different aspect of 4K movies here, the real-life stunts performed by traditional stunt professionals is what this one is all about. And it doesn’t let us down, crashes, explosions and car chases, everything that Bond is about. Except in 4K. Great.</p>
<h4 id="10-Fireworks"><a href="#10-Fireworks" class="headerlink" title="10. Fireworks"></a>10. Fireworks</h4><p>This one is just a lot of fun. Fireworks, in 4K. Color rendition, detail, it has it all. It opens with a magnificent view across the city showing the lights at dusk and beyond, and then into the stunning firework display, it really is quite spectacular and a great look at 4K footage.</p>
<p>That’s our top 10, not all the best technically, but each offers something a little different to give a taste of what 4K is all about, and exactly what your 4K screen is capable of.</p>

<h4 id="1-Ocean-Footage-underwater-sample-1"><a href="#1-Ocean-Footage-underwater-sample-1" class="headerlink" title="1. Ocean Footage underwater sample"></a>1. Ocean Footage underwater sample</h4><p>This one is first on my choice of 4K video sample for a couple of reasons, firstly I love the subject matter, and secondly from a technical perspective it is one of the best samples out there.</p>
<p>Filmed using a Red One camera, it displays the vibrancy and detail that we associate with 4K resolution at its best, the color depth of the fish and coral is astounding, and when the shot moves to a passing whale the sense of scale the resolution gives really shows what 4K is capable of, and why it is a step up from anything we have seen before.</p>
<h4 id="2-Trailer-for-the-movie-‘Elysium’-1"><a href="#2-Trailer-for-the-movie-‘Elysium’-1" class="headerlink" title="2. Trailer for the movie ‘Elysium’"></a>2. Trailer for the movie ‘Elysium’</h4><p>Very little movie production footage is easily available out there in 4K, but this is one of the exceptions. The full theatrical trailer for the movie in glorious Ultra HD, Why does this make the list? Well I think if you are wanting to see the benefits of 4K, then samples like the Ocean Footage one mentioned above really show off the technical prowess, but it is actual movies that most people will be wanting to use 4K kit for, and this gives you a very good indication of how much of an increase in clarity, detail and vibrancy can be gained by switching to 4K. The standard HD version of this trailer is readily available too, so this is something you could make a direct comparison with. The nature of the film, a sci-fi action film, also lends itself to 4K with lots of beautifully rendered CGI scenes in the trailer to look at.</p>
<h3 id="3-Timescapes-1"><a href="#3-Timescapes-1" class="headerlink" title="3. Timescapes"></a>3. Timescapes</h3><p>This is the trailer for an interesting project, filmed entirely in 4K and the work of one man, it is purported to be the first 4K film made available for sale. The film itself, and this trailer, is a simple concept, slow-motion and time lapse cinematography of the South West of America, taken as the director, Tom Lowe, travels around in his pickup truck. The concept itself makes for an interesting effect, but this sample is here because of the content. Watching the big expanses of nature flow by in 4K is simply mind blowing, here you really see the almost 3D effect so much resolution and detail bring to the medium, it isn’t like watching a video, it really is like looking out of a window at real life.</p>
<h3 id="4-Boat-Scenes-1"><a href="#4-Boat-Scenes-1" class="headerlink" title="4. Boat Scenes"></a>4. Boat Scenes</h3><p>There are actually several test videos on this subject, all of them do a good job of displaying 4K but for me it is the this one that focuses on passing boats against an expansive backdrop that is the one to look at. Again it shows the effect of 4K resolution when displaying the wider world around us, this time a harbor vista as the boat passes through it, detail can be seen in the water, the passengers on the boat and the backdrop, and the sense of realism and scale, which for me are the things that set 4K apart, are readily apparent here.</p>
<h3 id="5-Tears-of-Steel-trailer-1"><a href="#5-Tears-of-Steel-trailer-1" class="headerlink" title="5. Tears of Steel trailer"></a>5. Tears of Steel trailer</h3><p>Another rare 4K movie trailer, this one again shows lots of very high quality CGI that really show off the capabilities of 4K at their best. Some great use of the depth of field that 4K emphasizes in a lot of the shots and overall provides a great insight into 4K and what you can expect from it. An interesting video that also manages to tell a little story as well as being a showcase.</p>
<h3 id="6-Sintel-1"><a href="#6-Sintel-1" class="headerlink" title="6. Sintel"></a>6.

<p>Another feature of Sintel is its soft focus look that accentuates the high resolution, and makes this video stand out from others in the list.

<h4 id="1-Ocean-Footage-underwater-sample-3"><a href="#1-Ocean-Footage-underwater-sample-3" class="headerlink" title="1. Ocean Footage underwater sample"></a>1. Ocean Footage underwater sample</h4><p>This one is first on my choice of 4K video sample for a couple of reasons, firstly I love the subject matter, and secondly from a technical perspective it is one of the best samples out there.</p>
<p>Filmed using a Red One camera, it displays the vibrancy and detail that we associate with 4K resolution at its best, the color depth of the fish and coral is astounding, and when the shot moves to a passing whale the sense of scale the resolution gives really shows what 4K is capable of, and why it is a step up from anything we have seen before.</p>
<h4 id="2-Trailer-for-the-movie-‘Elysium’-3"><a href="#2-Trailer-for-the-movie-‘Elysium’-3" class="headerlink" title="2. Trailer for the movie ‘Elysium’"></a>2. Trailer for the movie ‘Elysium’</h4><p>Very little movie production footage is easily available out there in 4K, but this is one of the exceptions. The full theatrical trailer for the movie in glorious Ultra HD, Why does this make the list? Well I think if you are wanting to see the benefits of 4K, then samples like the Ocean Footage one mentioned above really show off the technical prowess, but it is actual movies that most people will be wanting to use 4K kit for, and this gives you a very good indication of how much of an increase in clarity, detail and vibrancy can be gained by switching to 4K. The standard HD version of this trailer is readily available too, so this is something you could make a direct comparison with. The nature of the film, a sci-fi action film, also lends itself to 4K with lots of beautifully rendered CGI scenes in the trailer to look at.</p>
<h3 id="3-Timescapes-3"><a href="#3-Timescapes-3" class="headerlink" title="3. Timescapes"></a>3. Timescapes</h3><p>This is the trailer for an interesting project, filmed entirely in 4K and the work of one man, it is purported to be the first 4K film made available for sale. The film itself, and this trailer, is a simple concept, slow-motion and time lapse cinematography of the South West of America, taken as the director, Tom Lowe, travels around in his pickup truck. The concept itself makes for an interesting effect, but this sample is here because of the content. Watching the big expanses of nature flow by in 4K is simply mind blowing, here you really see the almost 3D effect so much resolution and detail bring to the medium, it isn’t like watching a video, it really is like looking out of a window at real life.</p>
<h3 id="4-Boat-Scenes-3"><a href="#4-Boat-Scenes-3" class="headerlink" title="4. Boat Scenes"></a>4. Boat Scenes</h3><p>There are actually several test videos on this subject, all of them do a good job of displaying 4K but for me it is the this one that focuses on passing boats against an expansive backdrop that is the one to look at. Again it shows the effect of 4K resolution when displaying the wider world around us, this time a harbor vista as the boat passes through it, detail can be seen in the water, the passengers on the boat and the backdrop, and the sense of realism and scale, which for me are the things that set 4K apart, are readily apparent here.</p>
<h3 id="5-Tears-of-Steel-trailer-3"><a href="#5-Tears-of-Steel-trailer-3" class="headerlink" title="5. Tears of Steel trailer"></a>5. Tears of Steel trailer</h3><p>Another rare 4K movie trailer, this one again shows lots of very high quality CGI that really show off the capabilities of 4K at their best. Some great use of the depth of field that 4K emphasizes in a lot of the shots and overall provides a great insight into 4K and what you can expect from it. An interesting video that also manages to tell a little story as well as being a showcase.</p>
<h3 id="6-Sintel-3"><a href="#6-Sintel-3" class="headerlink" title="6. Sintel"></a>6. Sintel</h3><p>Sintel is an animated short created in the blender animation program, here in 4K it represents a fantastic look into what 4K can offer all forms of media, the opening scene, with the snow blowing in the wind, for instance, enables you to see incredible detail that just isn’t visible within the standard HD version. Seeing individual flies as the character searches through the wreckage of a town is another high point in terms of technical prowess.</p>
<p>Another feature of Sintel is its soft focus look that accentuates the high resolution, and makes this video stand out from others in the list. The small dragon is well animated and the main characters features, particularly the hair, are incredibly well realized. A great way to showcase your 4K equipment.</p>
<h3 id="7-Stock-Footage-Sample-3"><a href="#7-Stock-Footage-Sample-3" class="headerlink" title="7. Stock Footage Sample"></a>7. Stock Footage Sample</h3><p>This one is an amalgam of short clips from commercial stock footage that is used a sample of the product. That doesn’t make it any less of a fantastic 4K clip however, with footage chosen specifically to show off the benefits of 4K at its very best (it is a promotional package after all) there is something here for everyone. From the glorious colors of a sunrise to the explosions and the amazing time lapse, with, again, fantastic and vibrant colors, a real showcase for 4K in the true sense of the word.</p>
<h3 id="8-Honey-Bees-3"><a href="#8-Honey-Bees-3" class="headerlink" title="8. Honey Bees"></a>8. Honey Bees</h3><p>Back to nature for this one, and the eponymous Honey Bee. Showing not only the color rendition and detail of the surroundings, it also captures the Bees themselves in incredible fidelity, the wing detail, especially on the close-ups, is just way beyond anything we have seen from moving images before, high resolution stills? Certainly, but not video. Another great advert for 4K footage and a lovely film as well.</p>
<h4 id="9-Skyfall-Trailer-3"><a href="#9-Skyfall-Trailer-3" class="headerlink" title="9. Skyfall Trailer"></a>9. Skyfall Trailer</h4><p>Can’t say I’m much of a fan of the films, but as a way to see what very fast action looks like in 4K this is a great one. Unlike the other movie trailers, this one isn’t full of CGI, so it shows a different aspect of 4K movies here, the real-life stunts performed by traditional stunt professionals is what this one is all about. And it doesn’t let us down, crashes, explosions and car chases, everything that Bond is about. Except in 4K. Great.</p>
<h4 id="10-Fireworks-3"><a href="#10-Fireworks-3" class="headerlink" title="10. Fireworks"></a>10. Fireworks</h4><p>This one is just a lot of fun. Fireworks, in 4K. Color rendition, detail, it has it all. It opens with a magnificent view across the city showing the lights at dusk and beyond, and then into the stunning firework display, it really is quite spectacular and a great look at 4K footage.</p>
<p>That’s our top 10, not all the best technically, but each offers something a little different to give a taste of what 4K is all about, and exactly what your 4K screen is capable of.</p>
