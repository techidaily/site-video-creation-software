![ Create Stop Motion with Captured Photos  - create project](https://images.wondershare.com/filmora/article-images/create-project-in-cloud-stop-motion.jpg)

![ Capture Photos in  Cloud Stop Motion](https://images.wondershare.com/filmora/article-images/capture-photos-with-cloud-stop-motion.jpg)

In case you want to alter the frame rate, you can click on the Project Settings icon that is located at the top of the toolbar in the upper left corner of the screen.

## Part 3: How to Make Stop Motion Videos from Videos Online

Kapwing also offers the option to [play the video in reverse](https://tools.techidaily.com/wondershare/filmora/download/), but finding the right context to use this feature can prove to be a challenging task. Click on the Create button when ready to export the stop motion video and wait for the platform to generate the video.

![ kapwing stop motion maker export & share](https://images.wondershare.com/filmora/article-images/kapwing-stop-motion-maker-export.jpg)

Besides enhancing the photos you take with your Smartphone or your DSLR camera, you can use [photo editing software](https://tools.techidaily.com/wondershare/filmora/download/) to produce images that don’t look realistic. Cartooning a photo is one out of many options nearly all desktop-based photo editors offer, although in most cases you will have to combine several effects in order to cartoon your pictures.

However, photo to cartoon software products require some previous photo editing experience since you will have to do much more than apply an effect to a photo in order to make a photo look like a cartoon. We’ve selected some of the **best photo to cartoon software** products that can help you create stunning cartoons from your photos.

If you need to cartoon your video, you can try Filmora [video editor](https://tools.techidaily.com/wondershare/filmora/download/). The newly released Filmora professional video editing software can allow you to turn videos into cartoons with ease. The processing of converting videos into cartoon style is easy, just import the videos into Filmora, and then add the Cartoon effect under Stylize. Adjust the cartoon settings and do some basic color corrections to perfect the cartoon result.

Adobe Photoshop is one of the best photo editing software ever created, which is why it is hardly surprising that it can help you to cartoon a photo. Photoshop’s rich selection of effects includes a number of effects you can use to turn a photo into a cartoon.

Effects such as Sketch, Ink Outlines, or Cutout can all be used during this process, and you can also combine several effects while turning a photo into a cartoon. Needless to say, inexperienced photo editors can find this task overwhelming, because it requires a lot of patience and excellent knowledge of the software’s features.

After you locate the Artistic sub-menu, you should pick the Ink Sketch option and then adjust the Coloring and Ink Outline options. Optionally, you can also add Noise to the photo you’re cartooning if it fits the style you’re trying to achieve. However, picking the right picture can turn out to be vital for the success of the cartoon process in Paint.net.

### 3\. [iToon](https://www.itoon.net/)
