### 2\. Generated Photos: Anonymizer

You can learn how to use this section by following the instructions given below:

### 4\. Massless

**Website:** [https://massless.io/tool/face-maker-ai](https://massless.io/tool/face-maker-ai/)

Massless allows you to use its tools to sketch a portrait, and then it uses AI technology to generate a virtual face out of your drawing. However, because you can’t always be precise while sketching with the mouse, it would be good to have access to a digital drawing pad to create the faces with a pen.

You can follow the procedure given below to use Massless to draw virtual faces:

* Open a web browser, and visit the URL given above. Click any icons from the toolbox at the top (E.g., **Nose**).

If you don’t like the idea, you can change it with merely a single mouse click.

* Use your preferred web browser (Google Chrome here) to visit the URL provided above, and then notice the random image that appears on the page;

### 6\. BoredHumans

**Website**: <https://boredhumans.com/faces.php>

This web portal is identical to the previous one as it generates random virtual faces with merely one mouse click. Even this website doesn’t have any Download button to help you download the image. Therefore, you must use the browser’s built-in feature to obtain the photo you want to save to your PC.

You can learn how to use BoredHumans to generate virtual faces and download them to your computer by following the steps given below:

* Open a web browser (Google Chrome here) and visit the URL provided above, and then click **Generate Another Fake Human** if you don’t like the one that appears;
* Keep clicking the button until you find a face that can be used as your avatar. Alternatively, you can click the **Generate A Human** button to create a less realistic image of a random person.

![free online face generators boredhumans](https://images.wondershare.com/filmora/article-images/free-online-face-generators-boredhumans.jpg)

### 7\. faceMaker

**Website**: <https://facemaker.uvrg.org/>

faceMaker allows you to generate virtual faces out of the fine details that you specify during the creation process. These details are adjusted using the sliders that affect the corresponding physical attributes of the avatars. For example, you can modify the lips, eye color, hair, face roundness, mouse depth, jaw shape, etc. using their respective sliders.

You can follow the steps that are given below to learn how to create a virtual face using faceMaker, and save it to your PC to use it as an avatar:

* Use your preferred web browser to visit the URL given above and click **Start** from the main page.
* Fill out the questionnaire by choosing your preferred options and agreeing to the term and conditions.
* Click **Start** and then click **Continue** on the next page. Use the sliders on the left and right panels to customize the face as needed, and once done, you can use any screen capturing tool to take a snapshot and remove the sliders by cropping the image, thus having only the virtual face.

![free online face generators facemaker](https://images.wondershare.com/filmora/article-images/free-online-face-generators-facemaker.jpg)

* Save the cropped photo on your PC, and then back on the webpage, click **Finished** from the bottom-right corner.

![facemaker online face generators face](https://images.wondershare.com/filmora/article-images/facemaker-online-face-generators-face.jpg)

![download facemaker online face generators face](https://images.wondershare.com/filmora/article-images/download-facemaker-online-face-generators-face.jpg)

**Conclusion**

With all the cybercrime reports circulating everywhere nowadays, it is important to stay cautious about what you post on any social media website. To add an extra layer of security, you can avoid using your real photograph as a profile picture, and go with the fake faces instead. You can generate these virtual faces using any of the free online face generator websites, some of which even allow you to define the shape of a face quite minutely. Because the generated faces are not of any real human, they can be used as your avatar without any risk.

We've picked some best video converters that you can use which also support 4K footage.

Google Chromecast is a digital media player that allows you to stream MP4, WebM, MPEG-DASH, Smooth Streaming, and HTTP Live Streaming (HLS) video formats on your High Definition Television (HDTV). It requires a wireless connection using the Internet or a network-connected computer, tablet, or smartphone. You can play various multimedia content, but only Google Cast-supported formats can be streamed directly.

If you would like to play unsupported formats, such as MKV, VOB, FLV, and AVI, you will need to get a video format converter to stream movies, TV shows, and music videos with unsupported formats. We've picked some best video converters that you can use which also support 4K footage. Check the list of the[best 4K video converters](https://tools.techidaily.com/wondershare/filmora/download/) here. In this article, you will learn about supported and unsupported video formats and how you can stream them using your Chromecast media player.

## Part 1: Chromecast Supported and Unsupported Video Formats

The default Chromecast video formats are MP4 and WebM. It also supports MPEG-DASH, Smooth Streaming, and HTTP Live Streaming (HLS) video files. All other video formats are unsupported. The following information provides a brief introduction of supported and unsupported formats.

**Standard supported Chromecast video formats include:**

* **MP4** \- MPEG 4 or MP4 video files use the standard .mp4 extension. It is most commonly used to store video and audio files.
* **WebM** – An open video format for the web that allows everyone to stream video and audio codecs.

**Some unsupported video formats include:**

* **AVI**  – AVI (Audio Video Interleave), the most common format for audio/video data on the PC, is a multimedia container format with video and audio.
* **MKV**  – The Matroska Multimedia Container holds video, audio, picture, or subtitle tracks in one file.
* **FLV**  – Flash video formats are video files that are streamed over the Internet using the Adobe Flash Player.
* **MOV** – MOV is a multimedia file format that contains one and more tracks of data, such as audio, video or text.
* **VOB** – VOB (Video Object) files are DVD-Video file formats that contain digital video audio, audio, and subtitles relevant to DVDs.
* **3G2** – This is a video container file for audio, video, and text that is an extension of MP4.

What are the differences between each format? Check [What's Video Format?](https://tools.techidaily.com/wondershare/filmora/download/)

Since Chromecast only supports few video formats, it is recommended that you get a[video streaming application](https://tools.techidaily.com/wondershare/filmora/download/)that allows you to stream unsupported formats, such as M2TS, 3GP, DIVX, RM, RMVB, ASF, TS, DV, F4V, OGV, TOD. Wondershare Video Converter for example allows you to use Chromecast to stream unsupported formats through your Windows computer to your television.
