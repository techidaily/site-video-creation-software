**Further Reading:** 

H.264 has obvious advantage when [comparing H.264 to MPEG4](https://tools.techidaily.com/macxdvd/products/), it has higher compressing rate which means it can store more data than MPEG4 on the same hard disk. And as a successor to H.264/AVC, H.265 is said to have two times the data compression ratio compared to H.264 at the same level of video quality. So speaking of [H.265 vs. H.264](https://tools.techidaily.com/winxdvd/products/), H.265 simply surpasses H.264 in general. But the good thing is that as an H.264 player freeware, 5KPlayer can easily play H.265, MPEG4 as well.
