<p>Post-production always takes time regardless of how large or small your project is, but that doesn’t mean you can’t start promoting your movie before you complete it. In fact, filmmakers have been using movie trailers for years to inform the audience about their upcoming projects.</p>
<p>There is no need to spend money on a movie trailer maker since the video editing software you’re using to edit the footage can also be used to create trailers for videos you are working on. Even so, there are so many different video editing software products for Macs and PCs, that finding the one that is best suited for your video editing needs can be difficult. That is why in this article we are going to take you through the ten best trailer makers for Mac and Windows operating systems.</p>
<h2 id="Best-Movie-Trailer-Software-for-PC-and-Mac-Computers"><a href="#Best-Movie-Trailer-Software-for-PC-and-Mac-Computers" class="headerlink" title="Best Movie Trailer Software for PC and Mac Computers"></a>Best Movie Trailer Software for PC and Mac Computers</h2><p>Mastering a short video form like a movie trailer takes a lot of practice, as you only have a limited amount of time to tell your story. Each of the video editing software products we featured in this article grants you access to all the tools you’re going to need to tell your stories, but it is up to you which ones you are going to use to make your next movie trailer. So, let’s take a look at what best movie trailer makers for Mac and PC have to offer.</p>
<h3 id="1-iMovie"><a href="#1-iMovie" class="headerlink" title="1. iMovie"></a>1. <a class="link"   target="_blank" rel="noopener" href="https://www.apple.com/imovie/" >iMovie <i class="fa-regular fa-arrow-up-right-from-square fa-sm"></i></a></h3><p><strong>Price:</strong> Free</p>
<p><strong>Compatibility:</strong> macOS, iOS</p>
<p>Mac, iPhone and iPad users have a free and easy solution at their disposal if they want to make movie trailers. Besides offering basic video editing tools that enable you to edit your footage quickly, iMovie also features a collection of trailer templates. So, all you need to do in order to make a movie trailer is to add the video clips and insert the title of the movie, the director’s name and create the end credits.</p>

<p>Post-production always takes time regardless of how large or small your project is, but that doesn’t mean you can’t start promoting your movie before you complete it. In fact, filmmakers have been using movie trailers for years to inform the audience about their upcoming projects.</p>
<p>There is no need to spend money on a movie trailer maker since the video editing software you’re using to edit the footage can also be used to create trailers for videos you are working on. Even so, there are so many different video editing software products for Macs and PCs, that finding the one that is best suited for your video editing needs can be difficult. That is why in this article we are going to take you through the ten best trailer makers for Mac and Windows operating systems.</p>

Each of the video editing software products we featured in this article grants you access to all the tools you’re going to need to tell your stories, but it is up to you which ones you are going to use to make your next movie trailer.

<p><strong>Compatibility:</strong> macOS, iOS</p>
<p>Mac, iPhone and iPad users have a free and easy solution at their disposal if they want to make movie trailers. Besides offering basic video editing tools that enable you to edit your footage quickly, iMovie also features a collection of trailer templates. So, all you need to do in order to make a movie trailer is to add the video clips and insert the title of the movie, the director’s name and create the end credits.</p>
<p>None of the movie trailer templates you can find in iMovie allow you to add music to them, although you can create the soundtrack for your trailer from iMovie’s Movie mode. Furthermore, the templates can limit the maximum duration of your trailer, which is why you must make sure that the video clips you want to use match the duration of the trailer you selected.</p>

Even though most Hollywood trailers look alike, there is no fixed recipe you have to follow while making a movie trailer for your project. However, there a few guidelines that can help you convey the core messages of your movie to the audience.</p>
<h3 id="1-Don’t-Reveal-Too-Much-2"><a href="#1-Don’t-Reveal-Too-Much-2" class="headerlink" title="1. Don’t Reveal Too Much"></a>1. Don’t Reveal Too Much</h3><p>A movie trailer only needs to suggest what the movie is about, not tell its entire story. That’s why adopting the Less is More rule can be quite helpful during the process of making a movie trailer. Show just enough to spark the audience’s curiosity, because if you reveal too much they might feel as if they have already seen the best parts of your movie.</p>
<h3 id="2-Find-Creative-Ways-to-Use-Narration-and-Text-2"><a href="#2-Find-Creative-Ways-to-Use-Narration-and-Text-2" class="headerlink" title="2. Find Creative Ways to Use Narration and Text"></a>2. Find Creative Ways to Use Narration and Text</h3><p>Giving the audience all the information they need solely through images isn’t always possible, which is the reason why nearly all movie trailers have a narrator. Recording a voiceover and using text to convey the information about the movie to the audience will make the trailer more informative and a better promotional tool.</p>
<h3 id="3-Make-a-Soundtrack-2"><a href="#3-Make-a-Soundtrack-2" class="headerlink" title="3. Make a Soundtrack"></a>3. Make a Soundtrack</h3><p>Sound can give rhythm to a movie trailer, but it can also build suspense or suggest that something horrible is about to happen, which is why you shouldn’t hesitate to add audio effects or music to movie trailers you are making. The sound effects and the music must match the video perfectly in order for your trailer to be effective, which is the reason why you should dedicate special attention to the trailer’s soundtrack.</p>
<p><strong>Conclusion</strong></p>
<p>The key concepts of making a movie trailer are always the same, regardless of the video editing software you’re using. Each movie trailer maker we featured in this article offers more than enough video editing tools to make a dynamic and captivating movie trailer, but how you are going to use these tools entirely depends on the demands of your project.

Even though most Hollywood trailers look alike, there is no fixed recipe you have to follow while making a movie trailer for your project. However, there a few guidelines that can help you convey the core messages of your movie to the audience.</p>
<h3 id="1-Don’t-Reveal-Too-Much-3"><a href="#1-Don’t-Reveal-Too-Much-3" class="headerlink" title="1. Don’t Reveal Too Much"></a>1. Don’t Reveal Too Much</h3><p>A movie trailer only needs to suggest what the movie is about, not tell its entire story. That’s why adopting the Less is More rule can be quite helpful during the process of making a movie trailer. Show just enough to spark the audience’s curiosity, because if you reveal too much they might feel as if they have already seen the best parts of your movie.</p>
<h3 id="2-Find-Creative-Ways-to-Use-Narration-and-Text-3"><a href="#2-Find-Creative-Ways-to-Use-Narration-and-Text-3" class="headerlink" title="2. Find Creative Ways to Use Narration and Text"></a>2. Find Creative Ways to Use Narration and Text</h3><p>Giving the audience all the information they need solely through images isn’t always possible, which is the reason why nearly all movie trailers have a narrator. Recording a voiceover and using text to convey the information about the movie to the audience will make the trailer more informative and a better promotional tool.</p>
<h3 id="3-Make-a-Soundtrack-3"><a href="#3-Make-a-Soundtrack-3" class="headerlink" title="3. Make a Soundtrack"></a>3. Make a Soundtrack</h3><p>Sound can give rhythm to a movie trailer, but it can also build suspense or suggest that something horrible is about to happen, which is why you shouldn’t hesitate to add audio effects or music to movie trailers you are making. The sound effects and the music must match the video perfectly in order for your trailer to be effective, which is the reason why you should dedicate special attention to the trailer’s soundtrack.</p>
<p><strong>Conclusion</strong></p>
<p>The key concepts of making a movie trailer are always the same, regardless of the video editing software you’re using. Each movie trailer maker we featured in this article offers more than enough video editing tools to make a dynamic and captivating movie trailer, but how you are going to use these tools entirely depends on the demands of your project.

Besides capturing photos and videos, the app also allows you to import photos you want to include in the stop motion animation.

Tap on the photo option and start taking photos of the objects or people you want to include in your stop motion video.</p>
<p> The app also grants you access to a broad range of tools that will make composing the shots easier or reduce the flickering effect. Even though Life Lapse doesn’t limit the maximum duration of the stop motion videos you can create with it, an Instagram story cannot be longer than 15 seconds. Furthermore, changing a video’s aspect ratio to 9:16 is recommended, as it will enable you to know exactly how your stop motion video is going to look like after you upload it to Instagram.</p>

Even so, working on a stop motion project requires previous preparations. Here are a few tips that will help you make a better stop motion animation video.</p>
<h3 id="1-Develop-a-concept"><a href="#1-Develop-a-concept" class="headerlink" title="1. Develop a concept"></a>1. Develop a concept</h3><p> What is your stop motion video about? This is the first and the most important question you will have to answer before you start making a stop motion video. Developing a concept will enable you to know which props you are going to need or how many actors you have to find before you can actually start shooting. Stop motion videos can be virtually about anything, and you should choose a story that will keep the audience interested from start to finish.</p>
<h3 id="2-Shoot-in-studio-conditions"><a href="#2-Shoot-in-studio-conditions" class="headerlink" title="2. Shoot in studio conditions"></a>2. Shoot in studio conditions</h3><p> Although it is not impossible to make a stop motion video in outdoor conditions, having control over sudden light changes is. That is why it is much better to shoot stop motion videos in studio-like conditions where you can easily adjust all the parameters in accordance with the demands of the project you’re working on. In addition, it is paramount to keep your phone perfectly steady, which is why it is better to mount it on a tripod than to shoot handheld.</p>
<p><strong>Conclusion</strong></p>
<p> Instagram’s stop motion feature is still under development and it may be some time before you can use it to create professional-looking videos. Apps like Over or Life Lapse are a much better option for all video content creators who would like to impress their audience with stop motion videos.

<p> The fact that more than a million video content creators and brands are using Life Lapse to make stop motion videos says a lot about the app’s capabilities.

Besides capturing photos and videos, the app also allows you to import photos you want to include in the stop motion animation. Furthermore, even the free version of Life Lapse offers a variety of video editing tools that allow you to crop images or adjust saturation, brightness or white balance values in each frame.</p>

Tap on the photo option and start taking photos of the objects or people you want to include in your stop motion video.</p>
<p> The app also grants you access to a broad range of tools that will make composing the shots easier or reduce the flickering effect. Even though Life Lapse doesn’t limit the maximum duration of the stop motion videos you can create with it, an Instagram story cannot be longer than 15 seconds.

After you launch the app, you should tap on the <strong>Camera</strong> icon in the upper left corner of the screen.

<p> You will find the Stop Motion option at the end of this menu, and after you tap on it you just have to press the white button in the middle of the toolbar that is located near the bottom of the screen in order to start taking pictures.</p>
<p> Currently, Instagram limits the number of photos you can take with the stop motion feature to ten. Tap on the Done button that is located at the top of the screen once you completed the process of making a stop motion video and then proceed to choose stickers you would like to include in the story you created.

After you launch the app, you should tap on the <strong>Camera</strong> icon in the upper left corner of the screen. The new window will open where you can choose the type of Instagram story you want to create, so you can pick to <a class="link"   target="_blank" rel="noopener" href="https://tools.techidaily.com/wondershare/filmora/download/" >go live <i class="fa-regular fa-arrow-up-right-from-square fa-sm"></i></a>, record a video normally or use the app’s Boomerang feature.</p>
<p> You will find the Stop Motion option at the end of this menu, and after you tap on it you just have to press the white button in the middle of the toolbar that is located near the bottom of the screen in order to start taking pictures.</p>
<p> Currently, Instagram limits the number of photos you can take with the stop motion feature to ten. Tap on the Done button that is located at the top of the screen once you completed the process of making a stop motion video and then proceed to choose stickers you would like to include in the story you created. Press the Send To button and decide if you want to share the stop motion video to your Instagram or Facebook story or with some of your Instagram followers. ;</p>

<p> Like all other Instagram stories, stop motion videos created with this app are only available for 24 hours if you don’t save them on your phone. Moreover, <a class="link"   target="_blank" rel="noopener" href="https://tools.techidaily.com/wondershare/filmora/download/" >downloading the stories you create with Instagram <i class="fa-regular fa-arrow-up-right-from-square fa-sm"></i></a>’s stop motion tool will enable you to edit them with <a class="link"   target="_blank" rel="noopener" href="https://tools.techidaily.com/wondershare/filmora/download/" >video editing apps for iPhone <i class="fa-regular fa-arrow-up-right-from-square fa-sm"></i></a> and Android devices and post them to any social media platform you choose.</p>
<p> In addition, the maximum number of frames a stop motion video created with Instagram can have is limited to just ten.</p>

If the issue persists, you should opt for some other stop motion app you can use free of charge. ;</p>

With so many different options on the market, finding the app that provides you with all features you need to create stop motion videos can be a difficult task. That’s why we shortlisted the three best apps for iPhones and Android devices that enable you to make animated stop motion videos for Instagram.</p>
<h3 id="1-Over-3"><a href="#1-Over-3" class="headerlink" title="1. Over"></a>1. <a class="link"   target="_blank" rel="noopener" href="https://www.madewithover.com/" >Over <i class="fa-regular fa-arrow-up-right-from-square fa-sm"></i></a></h3><p><strong>Price:</strong> Free, offers in-app purchase</p>
<p><strong>Compatibility:</strong> iOS, Android</p>
<p> Over allows you to do much more than just create stop motion videos you can post on Instagram since it is equipped with a versatile set of tools that can help you improve the brand awareness on social media.

However, the free version of the app offers only limited capabilities, and you must upgrade to the Pro version if you want to have access to all photo and video editing tools Over have to offer.</p>

<p> Creating content for social media with Mojo is a simple process that can be completed in just three easy steps. You don’t even need a Mojo account to start creating stories with this app. All you have to do is select an animated template, import videos or photos and edit it before tapping on the share button. There are more than a hundred animated templates to choose from, so after you pick one, you just have to <a class="link"   target="_blank" rel="noopener" href="https://tools.techidaily.com/wondershare/filmora/download/" >add text overlays <i class="fa-regular fa-arrow-up-right-from-square fa-sm"></i></a>, but you must purchase Mojo Pro if you want to <a class="link"   target="_blank" rel="noopener" href="https://tools.techidaily.com/wondershare/filmora/download/" >change aspect ratios <i class="fa-regular fa-arrow-up-right-from-square fa-sm"></i></a>, duplicate stories or have access to all text styles and templates.</p>

                ></p>
<p> The fact that more than a million video content creators and brands are using Life Lapse to make stop motion videos says a lot about the app’s capabilities. Unlike Over and Mojo, Life Lapse lets you set the exposure and focus locks, switch on a grid or use the ghosted image overlay. Besides capturing photos and videos, the app also allows you to import photos you want to include in the stop motion animation. Furthermore, even the free version of Life Lapse offers a variety of video editing tools that allow you to crop images or adjust saturation, brightness or white balance values in each frame.</p>

As soon as the camera loads you’ll be asked to choose if you would like to create a photo or a video project. Tap on the photo option and start taking photos of the objects or people you want to include in your stop motion video.</p>
<p> The app also grants you access to a broad range of tools that will make composing the shots easier or reduce the flickering effect. Even though Life Lapse doesn’t limit the maximum duration of the stop motion videos you can create with it, an Instagram story cannot be longer than 15 seconds. Furthermore, changing a video’s aspect ratio to 9:16 is recommended, as it will enable you to know exactly how your stop motion video is going to look like after you upload it to Instagram.</p>

Even so, working on a stop motion project requires previous preparations. Here are a few tips that will help you make a better stop motion animation video.</p>
<h3 id="1-Develop-a-concept-3"><a href="#1-Develop-a-concept-3" class="headerlink" title="1. Develop a concept"></a>1. Develop a concept</h3><p> What is your stop motion video about? This is the first and the most important question you will have to answer before you start making a stop motion video. Developing a concept will enable you to know which props you are going to need or how many actors you have to find before you can actually start shooting. Stop motion videos can be virtually about anything, and you should choose a story that will keep the audience interested from start to finish.</p>
<h3 id="2-Shoot-in-studio-conditions-3"><a href="#2-Shoot-in-studio-conditions-3" class="headerlink" title="2. Shoot in studio conditions"></a>2. Shoot in studio conditions</h3><p> Although it is not impossible to make a stop motion video in outdoor conditions, having control over sudden light changes is. That is why it is much better to shoot stop motion videos in studio-like conditions where you can easily adjust all the parameters in accordance with the demands of the project you’re working on. In addition, it is paramount to keep your phone perfectly steady, which is why it is better to mount it on a tripod than to shoot handheld.</p>
<p><strong>Conclusion</strong></p>
<p> Instagram’s stop motion feature is still under development and it may be some time before you can use it to create professional-looking videos. Apps like Over or Life Lapse are a much better option for all video content creators who would like to impress their audience with stop motion videos.

Here are the factors to consider when choosing an online video editor.</p>
<h4 id="1-Pricing"><a href="#1-Pricing" class="headerlink" title="1. Pricing"></a>1. Pricing</h4><p>Whereas some online video editors are absolutely free, to others payment is a must to access no watermark option. It may be financially draining to subscribe to a $49.99&#x2F;month plan. Then, why not opt for the $9.99&#x2F;month if you have to?</p>
<p>It’s critically important to weigh your financial strengths. However, the features included in the paid plans and the video purpose determine how much to spend.</p>
<h4 id="2-Features"><a href="#2-Features" class="headerlink" title="2. Features"></a>2. Features</h4><p>The attractiveness and video theme are better actualized by the features you use. Can you spot “no watermark” indicated anywhere within the features? Whether your edited videos will show with editor labels or watermarks is determined by the online video editor’s features.</p>
<p>Choosing an online video editor with cloud-based storage full of royalty-free videos and templates helps save time and simplifies editing procedures.</p>
<h4 id="3-Ease-of-Use"><a href="#3-Ease-of-Use" class="headerlink" title="3. Ease of Use"></a>3. Ease of Use</h4><p>Some online video editors are so complex that you’ve to tutorials and guides before starting to edit. You don’t have to spend 2 hours editing a 10-minute video.</p>
<p>Before you can begin to use any video editor, consider evaluating the complexity of all features to use. How to import images and share edited videos to social media and websites should be given first priority during the evaluation process.</p>
<h4 id="4-Purpose-of-the-Video"><a href="#4-Purpose-of-the-Video" class="headerlink" title="4. Purpose of the Video"></a>4. Purpose of the Video</h4><p>Creating and editing commercial videos require an online video editor with features designed with a business theme. You cannot choose an editor with watermarks and yet you are advertising a different product.</p>
<p>Tutorial videos are usually above 8 minutes and the voice should be as clear as possible. Some video editors and plans are limited to a 5-minute video.</p>

<h2 id="Part-1-What-to-Consider-When-Choosing-an-Online-Video-Editor-1"><a href="#Part-1-What-to-Consider-When-Choosing-an-Online-Video-Editor-1" class="headerlink" title="Part 1: What to Consider When Choosing an Online Video Editor"></a>Part 1: What to Consider When Choosing an Online Video Editor</h2><p>Each video editor listed below has its distinct features. Here are the factors to consider when choosing an online video editor.</p>
<h4 id="1-Pricing-1"><a href="#1-Pricing-1" class="headerlink" title="1. Pricing"></a>1. Pricing</h4><p>Whereas some online video editors are absolutely free, to others payment is a must to access no watermark option. It may be financially draining to subscribe to a $49.99&#x2F;month plan. Then, why not opt for the $9.99&#x2F;month if you have to?</p>
<p>It’s critically important to weigh your financial strengths. However, the features included in the paid plans and the video purpose determine how much to spend.</p>
<h4 id="2-Features-1"><a href="#2-Features-1" class="headerlink" title="2. Features"></a>2. Features</h4><p>The attractiveness and video theme are better actualized by the features you use. Can you spot “no watermark” indicated anywhere within the features? Whether your edited videos will show with editor labels or watermarks is determined by the online video editor’s features.</p>
<p>Choosing an online video editor with cloud-based storage full of royalty-free videos and templates helps save time and simplifies editing procedures.</p>
<h4 id="3-Ease-of-Use-1"><a href="#3-Ease-of-Use-1" class="headerlink" title="3. Ease of Use"></a>3. Ease of Use</h4><p>Some online video editors are so complex that you’ve to tutorials and guides before starting to edit. You don’t have to spend 2 hours editing a 10-minute video.</p>
<p>Before you can begin to use any video editor, consider evaluating the complexity of all features to use. How to import images and share edited videos to social media and websites should be given first priority during the evaluation process.</p>
<h4 id="4-Purpose-of-the-Video-1"><a href="#4-Purpose-of-the-Video-1" class="headerlink" title="4. Purpose of the Video"></a>4. Purpose of the Video</h4><p>Creating and editing commercial videos require an online video editor with features designed with a business theme. You cannot choose an editor with watermarks and yet you are advertising a different product.</p>
<p>Tutorial videos are usually above 8 minutes and the voice should be as clear as possible. Some video editors and plans are limited to a 5-minute video.</p>

Here are the factors to consider when choosing an online video editor.</p>
<h4 id="1-Pricing-2"><a href="#1-Pricing-2" class="headerlink" title="1. Pricing"></a>1. Pricing</h4><p>Whereas some online video editors are absolutely free, to others payment is a must to access no watermark option. It may be financially draining to subscribe to a $49.99&#x2F;month plan. Then, why not opt for the $9.99&#x2F;month if you have to?</p>
<p>It’s critically important to weigh your financial strengths. However, the features included in the paid plans and the video purpose determine how much to spend.</p>
<h4 id="2-Features-2"><a href="#2-Features-2" class="headerlink" title="2. Features"></a>2. Features</h4><p>The attractiveness and video theme are better actualized by the features you use. Can you spot “no watermark” indicated anywhere within the features? Whether your edited videos will show with editor labels or watermarks is determined by the online video editor’s features.</p>
<p>Choosing an online video editor with cloud-based storage full of royalty-free videos and templates helps save time and simplifies editing procedures.</p>
<h4 id="3-Ease-of-Use-2"><a href="#3-Ease-of-Use-2" class="headerlink" title="3. Ease of Use"></a>3. Ease of Use</h4><p>Some online video editors are so complex that you’ve to tutorials and guides before starting to edit. You don’t have to spend 2 hours editing a 10-minute video.</p>
<p>Before you can begin to use any video editor, consider evaluating the complexity of all features to use. How to import images and share edited videos to social media and websites should be given first priority during the evaluation process.</p>
<h4 id="4-Purpose-of-the-Video-2"><a href="#4-Purpose-of-the-Video-2" class="headerlink" title="4. Purpose of the Video"></a>4. Purpose of the Video</h4><p>Creating and editing commercial videos require an online video editor with features designed with a business theme. You cannot choose an editor with watermarks and yet you are advertising a different product.</p>
<p>Tutorial videos are usually above 8 minutes and the voice should be as clear as possible. Some video editors and plans are limited to a 5-minute video.</p>

Here are the factors to consider when choosing an online video editor.</p>
<h4 id="1-Pricing-3"><a href="#1-Pricing-3" class="headerlink" title="1. Pricing"></a>1. Pricing</h4><p>Whereas some online video editors are absolutely free, to others payment is a must to access no watermark option. It may be financially draining to subscribe to a $49.99&#x2F;month plan. Then, why not opt for the $9.99&#x2F;month if you have to?</p>
<p>It’s critically important to weigh your financial strengths. However, the features included in the paid plans and the video purpose determine how much to spend.</p>
<h4 id="2-Features-3"><a href="#2-Features-3" class="headerlink" title="2. Features"></a>2. Features</h4><p>The attractiveness and video theme are better actualized by the features you use. Can you spot “no watermark” indicated anywhere within the features? Whether your edited videos will show with editor labels or watermarks is determined by the online video editor’s features.</p>
<p>Choosing an online video editor with cloud-based storage full of royalty-free videos and templates helps save time and simplifies editing procedures.</p>
<h4 id="3-Ease-of-Use-3"><a href="#3-Ease-of-Use-3" class="headerlink" title="3. Ease of Use"></a>3. Ease of Use</h4><p>Some online video editors are so complex that you’ve to tutorials and guides before starting to edit. You don’t have to spend 2 hours editing a 10-minute video.</p>
<p>Before you can begin to use any video editor, consider evaluating the complexity of all features to use. How to import images and share edited videos to social media and websites should be given first priority during the evaluation process.</p>
<h4 id="4-Purpose-of-the-Video-3"><a href="#4-Purpose-of-the-Video-3" class="headerlink" title="4. Purpose of the Video"></a>4. Purpose of the Video</h4><p>Creating and editing commercial videos require an online video editor with features designed with a business theme. You cannot choose an editor with watermarks and yet you are advertising a different product.</p>
<p>Tutorial videos are usually above 8 minutes and the voice should be as clear as possible. Some video editors and plans are limited to a 5-minute video.</p>
