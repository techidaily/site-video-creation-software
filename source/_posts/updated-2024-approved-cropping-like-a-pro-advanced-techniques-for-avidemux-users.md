It has many uses, and one of the best tools available for cropping video is the free program Avidemux. Here we are going to go through the process of getting Avidemux running on your system and cropping some video.

## How to Crop a Video with Avidemux

#### 1\. Installation

You can find [Avidemux for download here](http://fixounet.free.fr/avidemux/), it is available for a wide range of platforms, just download the version that fits your needs. Once downloaded, install in the standard way for your platform, this is the Wndows version (64bit).

One point of note during installation is that you can choose which parts of the program you wish to install. It is a very small footprint and for the best performance it is wise to simply install everything.

![Installation2](https://images.wondershare.com/multimedia/installation2.png)

Once installed you will be presented with the program as seen here.

![Installation3](https://images.wondershare.com/multimedia/installation3.png)

#### 2\. Importing Video

The next step is importing video. This can be done in two ways, by clicking the file folder icon at the top left you open a standard file browser to navigate to, and select your chosen video file, or alternatively you can simply drag you video into the main panel to import it.

![Importing Video1](https://images.wondershare.com/multimedia/importing-video1.png)

Whichever route you take, you will end up with your video file loaded in like this.

![Importing Video2](https://images.wondershare.com/multimedia/importing-video2.png)

Now you can edit the video as you need, Avidemux contains a wealth of features to enable the full spectrum of editing tasks to be completed. However, here we are going to look at the cropping tool, so on to the next step.

#### 3\. Editing Video

Avidemux has some idiosyncrasies in terms of operation, one of those is that to be able to edit any video, you have to choose your output format. Don’t worry though, this is easy, just use the dropdown at the side to choose the output format you want as can be seen here.

![Editing Video](https://images.wondershare.com/multimedia/editing-video.png)

Once that is set you are free to start editing your footage.

#### 4\. Cropping

It is important to understand how the editing process works in Avidemux, everything is accessed via the filters menu Video>Filters and from here you are faced with a new interface that enables you to choose the component you wish to use.

![Cropping1](https://images.wondershare.com/multimedia/cropping.png)

Selecting ‘Crop’ from the menu and pressing the green plus symbol at the bottom activated the crop tool and presents you with yet another view that allows you to adjust the crop to your tastes.

![Cropping2](https://images.wondershare.com/multimedia/cropping2.png)

#### 5\. Cropping controls

There are two options for cropping, you can use the Auto crop feature, which will detect any black lines and crop the footage between them, or if you are using the crop tool for something else, or just want to do it manually, you can set the crop via the left right top and bottom boxes. Values input here are the number of pixels from that edge the crop extends, as you are setting it, this is displayed with a green block signifying the area of the image that will be removed.

![Cropping controls1](https://images.wondershare.com/multimedia/cropping-controls1.png)

You can adjust this independently for all 4 edges as you wish.

![Cropping controls2](https://images.wondershare.com/multimedia/cropping-controls2.png)

Once you are happy with the crop, you click Ok and it takes you back to the familiar filter menu where you can use other components to perform more editing if you need.

#### 6\. Saving the crop

One of the most common points of confusion with Avidemux comes at this point, as your video will look no different to when you started, and many think they have done something wrong, but this is another part of Avidemux workflow. These filters can only be applied when the video is reencoded, and you do that through the file>save menu.

![Saving the crop1](https://images.wondershare.com/multimedia/saving-the-crop1.png)

Selecting this presents the familiar export dialogue and allows you to choose the name and destination of the file. Once that is done you click OK and you will see Avidemux processing your file and re-rendering it in this dialogue box.

![Saving the crop2](https://images.wondershare.com/multimedia/saving-the-crop2.png)

How long it takes will depend on a few factors, how many other effects have been added, how fast a processor your computer has, and how large and what resolution the video is. Format also plays a part in the process too, with some formats taking less time to encode than others. Once it has finished, you can view your video and see the crop in action.

As we can see, although there are a few aspects of the workflow that are a little unintuitive, cropping video in Avidemux is a straightforward process that anyone can accomplish with a bit of patience.

One of the key things to remember with Avidemux is that you apply all of your filters before re-encoding, this again is a question of patience and a bit of organization to ensure everything you wish to do is completed in order.

Avidemux is a great piece of software, it lacks the polish of some of its commercial rivals of course, but behind the sometimes clunky interface there is a very broad range of features that allow you to accomplish more or less any editing task you may want. In terms of free programs this is about as good as it gets, and the output is, without a doubt, great quality. For anyone looking for a free solution to video editing problems, and who do not mind a learning process Avidemux provides a useful tool.

There are two options for cropping, you can use the Auto crop feature, which will detect any black lines and crop the footage between them, or if you are using the crop tool for something else, or just want to do it manually, you can set the crop via the left right top and bottom boxes. Values input here are the number of pixels from that edge the crop extends, as you are setting it, this is displayed with a green block signifying the area of the image that will be removed.

![Cropping controls1](https://images.wondershare.com/multimedia/cropping-controls1.png)

You can adjust this independently for all 4 edges as you wish.

![Cropping controls2](https://images.wondershare.com/multimedia/cropping-controls2.png)

Once you are happy with the crop, you click Ok and it takes you back to the familiar filter menu where you can use other components to perform more editing if you need.

#### 6\. Saving the crop

One of the most common points of confusion with Avidemux comes at this point, as your video will look no different to when you started, and many think they have done something wrong, but this is another part of Avidemux workflow. These filters can only be applied when the video is reencoded, and you do that through the file>save menu.

![Saving the crop1](https://images.wondershare.com/multimedia/saving-the-crop1.png)

Selecting this presents the familiar export dialogue and allows you to choose the name and destination of the file. Once that is done you click OK and you will see Avidemux processing your file and re-rendering it in this dialogue box.

![Saving the crop2](https://images.wondershare.com/multimedia/saving-the-crop2.png)

How long it takes will depend on a few factors, how many other effects have been added, how fast a processor your computer has, and how large and what resolution the video is. Format also plays a part in the process too, with some formats taking less time to encode than others. Once it has finished, you can view your video and see the crop in action.

As we can see, although there are a few aspects of the workflow that are a little unintuitive, cropping video in Avidemux is a straightforward process that anyone can accomplish with a bit of patience.

One of the key things to remember with Avidemux is that you apply all of your filters before re-encoding, this again is a question of patience and a bit of organization to ensure everything you wish to do is completed in order.

Avidemux is a great piece of software, it lacks the polish of some of its commercial rivals of course, but behind the sometimes clunky interface there is a very broad range of features that allow you to accomplish more or less any editing task you may want. In terms of free programs this is about as good as it gets, and the output is, without a doubt, great quality. For anyone looking for a free solution to video editing problems, and who do not mind a learning process Avidemux provides a useful tool.

 Adobe Premiere is a powerful and useful video editing software for both professional and novice video editors. Dozens of great video editing features are offered. When you are editing your videos with Adobe Premiere, you can use some useful Adobe Premiere tips to help you run the program faster and do the video editing more efficiently. Here the most useful 10 tips for using [Adobe Premiere Pro](https://tools.techidaily.com/wondershare/filmora/download/) and [Adobe Premiere Elements](https://tools.techidaily.com/wondershare/filmora/download/) are provided for your reference.

---

 This is a basic tutorial about Adobe Premiere, professional video editing software. However, if video editing is new to you, consider [Wondershare Filmora](https://tools.techidaily.com/wondershare/filmora/download/), which is a powerful but easy-to-use tool for users just starting out. Download the free trial version below.

[![Download Win Version](https://images.wondershare.com/filmora/guide/download-btn-win.jpg)](https://tools.techidaily.com/wondershare/filmora/download/)[Download Mac Version](https://images.wondershare.com/filmora/guide/download-btn-mac.jpg)](https://tools.techidaily.com/wondershare/filmora/download/)

 Use the following Adobe Premiere tips to make your video editing easier and save time and energy. Make the process much easier than you had thought.

## Useful Adobe Premiere Pro and Elements tips

#### 1. Change the default settings

 You can save some time on video editing by changing two default settings: Scale Media to Project Size and Default Picture Length. You can go to Edit > Preferences > General to find the two settings. Scale Media to Project Size means any photo or video will be scaled down to the project size. This setting will save you a lot of time especially when you are mixing a lot of SD and HD video and photos. Default Picture Length originally is set at 150 frames or five seconds of footage. You can change it to any set mount so that you don't need to adjust every photo you import. When you finished the settings changing, hit "OK" to save.

#### 2.Capture video clips from your camcorder directly

 Remember that you don't need to transfer your camcorder videos to your hard drive first and then import the video clips to Adobe Premiere. When you have connected your camcorder or other video capture devices to your computer, set the camcorder to playback or set it in VCR mode. Then, in Adobe Premiere, start a new project and go to File > Capture to import your media from your camcorder directly. This will save your some time for Adobe Premiere video editing.

#### 3. Keep your project more organized with "Bins"

 You can click the "Folder" icon in the "Project" window to create a new folder to store video clips or other things. Store them in many different folders rather than only one so that you can find what you want more quickly. Create bins for storing separate audio, video, photo, etc. This Adobe Premiere tip will definitely makes your project more organized and can save time for editing.

#### 4. Create personalized video transitions

 When adding transition effects to videos, you can make some adjustments to the transition effects to make them more personalized. You can locate the transition effects in the "Effects" tab. And in the "Effect Controls" tab, you adjust the transitions such as changing the duration time, changing the entrance animation, etc.

#### 5. Choose the most suitable output video format

 Take the output video quality to consideration when creating a new project in Adobe Premier. For example, if you just want to share the videos on YouTube, then you don't need to create HD videos because it will take you much more time to upload the videos to Internet if they're HD videos. Besides, the HD videos also need much more storage space. Get the smaller video size with better compression and easily share your videos on Web.

#### 6. Quick render

 In Adobe Premiere, most effects and videos render in real time. To have a full preview of all the effects, you can press "Enter", which will render the project and enables you to preview the overall video effect in the "Monitor" window.

 Tip: Adobe Premiere is a very professional video editor and costs a lot. For a video editing beginner, it's better turn to some easy-to-use yet powerful video editor, say [Wondershare Filmora (originally Wondershare Video Editor)](https://tools.techidaily.com/wondershare/filmora/download/), which can help you burn to DVD directly and share to YouTube in several click. If you don't want to spend any money on video editing, you can also turn to some free video editing software like Windows Movie Maker or iMovie.

For example, if you just want to share the videos on YouTube, then you don't need to create HD videos because it will take you much more time to upload the videos to Internet if they're HD videos. Besides, the HD videos also need much more storage space. Get the smaller video size with better compression and easily share your videos on Web.

#### 6. Quick render

 In Adobe Premiere, most effects and videos render in real time. To have a full preview of all the effects, you can press "Enter", which will render the project and enables you to preview the overall video effect in the "Monitor" window.

 Tip: Adobe Premiere is a very professional video editor and costs a lot. For a video editing beginner, it's better turn to some easy-to-use yet powerful video editor, say [Wondershare Filmora (originally Wondershare Video Editor)](https://tools.techidaily.com/wondershare/filmora/download/), which can help you burn to DVD directly and share to YouTube in several click. If you don't want to spend any money on video editing, you can also turn to some free video editing software like Windows Movie Maker or iMovie.

---

 This is a basic tutorial about Adobe Premiere, professional video editing software. However, if video editing is new to you, consider [Wondershare Filmora](https://tools.techidaily.com/wondershare/filmora/download/), which is a powerful but easy-to-use tool for users just starting out. Download the free trial version below.

[![Download Win Version](https://images.wondershare.com/filmora/guide/download-btn-win.jpg)](https://tools.techidaily.com/wondershare/filmora/download/)[Download Mac Version](https://images.wondershare.com/filmora/guide/download-btn-mac.jpg)](https://tools.techidaily.com/wondershare/filmora/download/)

 Use the following Adobe Premiere tips to make your video editing easier and save time and energy. Make the process much easier than you had thought.

## Useful Adobe Premiere Pro and Elements tips

#### 1. Change the default settings

 You can save some time on video editing by changing two default settings: Scale Media to Project Size and Default Picture Length. You can go to Edit > Preferences > General to find the two settings. Scale Media to Project Size means any photo or video will be scaled down to the project size. This setting will save you a lot of time especially when you are mixing a lot of SD and HD video and photos. Default Picture Length originally is set at 150 frames or five seconds of footage. You can change it to any set mount so that you don't need to adjust every photo you import. When you finished the settings changing, hit "OK" to save.

#### 2.Capture video clips from your camcorder directly

 Remember that you don't need to transfer your camcorder videos to your hard drive first and then import the video clips to Adobe Premiere. When you have connected your camcorder or other video capture devices to your computer, set the camcorder to playback or set it in VCR mode. Then, in Adobe Premiere, start a new project and go to File > Capture to import your media from your camcorder directly. This will save your some time for Adobe Premiere video editing.

#### 3. Keep your project more organized with "Bins"

 You can click the "Folder" icon in the "Project" window to create a new folder to store video clips or other things. Store them in many different folders rather than only one so that you can find what you want more quickly. Create bins for storing separate audio, video, photo, etc. This Adobe Premiere tip will definitely makes your project more organized and can save time for editing.

#### 4. Create personalized video transitions

 When adding transition effects to videos, you can make some adjustments to the transition effects to make them more personalized. You can locate the transition effects in the "Effects" tab. And in the "Effect Controls" tab, you adjust the transitions such as changing the duration time, changing the entrance animation, etc.

#### 5. Choose the most suitable output video format

 Take the output video quality to consideration when creating a new project in Adobe Premier. For example, if you just want to share the videos on YouTube, then you don't need to create HD videos because it will take you much more time to upload the videos to Internet if they're HD videos. Besides, the HD videos also need much more storage space. Get the smaller video size with better compression and easily share your videos on Web.

#### 6. Quick render

1. How long can Audacity record for?

Since Audacity stores samples as 64-bit values (even on 32-bit devices), there is no 32-bit rule that says recordings can't be longer than 231 samples (which is for example, just over 13.5 hours at a 44,100 Hz sample rate).

1. How do I change things in Apowersoft?

Use magic and fantasy to make your edits. To cut or crop a video file, click the scissors or cropping icon, depending on what you want to do. To join videos, drag files into the timeline in the order you want. Add filters and video overlay to your movie to make it look better.
