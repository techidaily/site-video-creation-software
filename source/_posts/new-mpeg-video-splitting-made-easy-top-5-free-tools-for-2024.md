* [**Part 1: Download VLLO on Mac**](#part1)
* [**Part 2: Best VLLO for Mac Alternatives**](#part2)

![install vllo](https://images.wondershare.com/filmora/article-images/vllo-for-mac-2.jpg)

There you go, you can now use the VLLO video editor on your MacBook. Of course, the application will not be that handy, but you have to consider the fact that the application is designed for smartphones, not computers. Still, the feature set remains the same, so it will be convenient if you have already used the application beforehand.

## Part 2: Best VLLO for Mac Alternatives

Not impressed with VLLO and looking for alternatives? Well, here are the two best applications that have the capabilities to impress you. First on the list is among the most powerful video-editing tools on the internet, and second Apple’s own free program for Mac users. Read on to find which one is the best for you!

### 1\. [Wondershare Filmora](https://tools.techidaily.com/wondershare/filmora/download/) \[YouTubers & Vloggers\]

Wondershare Filmora for Mac is recognized as the best [macOS video editor](https://tools.techidaily.com/wondershare/filmora/download/) software for beginners and intermediates in the industry. The reason: be it the interface, supported formats, features, or export options — the Filmora for Mac is superior in comparison to regular software.

The AI-backed interface is intuitive enough to allow even beginner-level video editors to utilize the application to the fullest; plus, it is powerful enough to impress expert video editors. Also, the software supports all video, audio, and image formats, so you do not have to waste your time with encoding before proceeding to edit the videos. Coming to the features — to sum up in brief — the Filmora for Mac contains all that is expected from video-editing software.

[![Download Filmora9 Win Version](https://images.wondershare.com/filmora/guide/download-btn-win.jpg) ](https://tools.techidaily.com/wondershare/filmora/download/) [![Download Filmora9 Mac Version](https://images.wondershare.com/filmora/guide/download-btn-mac.jpg) ](https://tools.techidaily.com/wondershare/filmora/download/)

[![Download Filmora9 Mac Version](https://images.wondershare.com/filmora/images2022/download-mac-store.png) ](https://apps.apple.com/app/apple-store/id1516822341?pt=169436&ct=pc-article-top50&mt=8)

**Why should I use the Filmora for Mac instead of VLLO? Reasons:**

* Filmora has an intuitive, modern interface that makes things like rotating, merging, trimming, splitting, cropping, and flipping videos effortless and convenient for newbies, semi-pros, or pros.
* The software is free to utilize
* Auto-color and color correction options to tune your video exactly as you want
* Easiest keyframing experience of any software; one-click options preset options to create custom animations
* The application allows you to record a voiceover directly into your project timeline.
* You can remove video noise from your footage.

### 2\. [iMovie](https://www.apple.com/imovie/)\[Beginners\]

Apple native iMovie is a simple and basic video editing tool that can well compete with the likes of VLLO. But there is a good reason to mention the application as the second in the list next to Filmora for Mac. And the reason: it is not as powerful, intuitive as Filmora for Mac. Mind you, iMovie includes all the basic features needed for everyday video editing. You can cut, split, trim, and apply filters, effects, and more. However, for the sake of the simple interface — Apple excluded important features like Timeline panel from the interface, giving you less control over the videos.

In all, the application is suitable for the users who do not need powerful editing features or take much control of what’s happening in the video. Still, given the fact that the application is free to utilize, it does not hurt to download the application and verify whether the application will suit your needs or not.

![imovie](https://images.wondershare.com/filmora/article-images/vllo-for-mac-3.jpg)

**Why should I use iMovie instead of VLLO? Reasons:**

* First things first, iMovie interface will be much more convenient to the users on MacBook instead of the smartphone-type interface of the VLLO
* The app has all the basic editing options needed to enrich the footage looks
* Free to utilize application, no ads like VLLO

### 2\. [iMovie](https://www.apple.com/imovie/)\[Beginners\]

But there is a good reason to mention the application as the second in the list next to Filmora for Mac. And the reason: it is not as powerful, intuitive as Filmora for Mac. Mind you, iMovie includes all the basic features needed for everyday video editing. You can cut, split, trim, and apply filters, effects, and more. However, for the sake of the simple interface — Apple excluded important features like Timeline panel from the interface, giving you less control over the videos.

Still, given the fact that the application is free to utilize, it does not hurt to download the application and verify whether the application will suit your needs or not.

![mp4 format](https://images.wondershare.com/filmora/article-images/2021/solution-for-choosing-fast-youtube-to-mp4-video-converter-02.jpg)

MP4 files were executed under the ISO/IEC 14496-12:2001 standard by the IEC/ISO and Motion Picture Experts Group (MPEG). MP4 is an international specification for audio-visual coding only because of this.

The high degree of compression used in MP4 videos assists the files to be much smaller in size than other video formats. Minimizing the file size doesn't suddenly affect the file quality, either. Almost the entire original quality retains, making MP4 a web-friendly and portable video format.

They shouldn't be confused with M4A and MP3, while MP4 files can play audio.

It can also help to store the other kinds of data files, such as different subtitles and still images.

### 02**Pros and Cons of the MP4 format**

**Pros of the MP4 format**

One of the critical merits of the MP4 format is that it can be valuable on different platforms.

**●** An MP4 file can contain metadata and Extensible Meta Data Platform such as images based on PNG or JPEG format, subtitles, among others, and PDF.

**●** Compatible with metadata integrable with 3D graphics, user navigation or menus options, and other user interaction features.

**●** There are numerous open-source players, such as VLC Media Player, that offer full format support, even used on Linux OS.

**●** It is also versatile. For example, audio files coded with the M4A extension and MPEG-4 visual bitstreams encoded in the M4V extension.

**Cons of the MP4 format**

Note that the format is a container. This means that instead of storing the ode for the file, it keeps the data. Moreover, a specific MP4 file is based upon particular codecs because it does not have a native way of managing the involved coding.

Yet, because the container format has become widely used, widely-supported codecs have become standards.

**●** Audio can drift out of the way or connect with the video in specific scenarios because of codec-player or codecs compatibility issues.

**●** Because a single file can contain video and audio and different metadata, editing or playback or editing needs various computing resources.

**●** It is still a lossy format. A higher compression format and smaller file size would result in audio and video quality losses.

**●** The familiarity of the MP4 format, coupled with its portability, has also enabled the illegal distribution of copyrighted audio-video files.

## Part 1 The Only Guide You'll Ever Need to Learn about YouTube to MP4 Video Converter

### 01**What is the MP4 format?**

![mp4 format](https://images.wondershare.com/filmora/article-images/2021/solution-for-choosing-fast-youtube-to-mp4-video-converter-02.jpg)

MP4 files were executed under the ISO/IEC 14496-12:2001 standard by the IEC/ISO and Motion Picture Experts Group (MPEG). MP4 is an international specification for audio-visual coding only because of this.

The high degree of compression used in MP4 videos assists the files to be much smaller in size than other video formats. Minimizing the file size doesn't suddenly affect the file quality, either. Almost the entire original quality retains, making MP4 a web-friendly and portable video format.

They shouldn't be confused with M4A and MP3, while MP4 files can play audio.

It can also help to store the other kinds of data files, such as different subtitles and still images.

This media container allows a blend of video, audio, subtitles, and still images to be present only in a single file. It also assists in storing advanced content like 3D Graphics, interactivity of the menus, and the users. This tool is highly accessible, and everyone can use it with simplicity.

### 02**Pros and Cons of the MP4 format**

**Pros of the MP4 format**

One of the critical merits of the MP4 format is that it can be valuable on different platforms.

**●** It consists of a high degree of compression while producing smaller file sizes, making it a perfect fit for compressing or video streaming HD audio-video files.

**●** An MP4 file can contain metadata and Extensible Meta Data Platform such as images based on PNG or JPEG format, subtitles, among others, and PDF.

**●** Compatible with metadata integrable with 3D graphics, user navigation or menus options, and other user interaction features.

**●** There are numerous open-source players, such as VLC Media Player, that offer full format support, even used on Linux OS.

**●** It is also versatile. For example, audio files coded with the M4A extension and MPEG-4 visual bitstreams encoded in the M4V extension.

**Cons of the MP4 format**

Note that the format is a container. This means that instead of storing the ode for the file, it keeps the data. Moreover, a specific MP4 file is based upon particular codecs because it does not have a native way of managing the involved coding.

A possible drawback is that there are hundreds of codecs available. Therefore, a media player must run a set of codecs concerning a particular MP4 file.

Yet, because the container format has become widely used, widely-supported codecs have become standards.

**●** Audio can drift out of the way or connect with the video in specific scenarios because of codec-player or codecs compatibility issues.

**●** Because a single file can contain video and audio and different metadata, editing or playback or editing needs various computing resources.

**●** It is still a lossy format. A higher compression format and smaller file size would result in audio and video quality losses.

**●** The familiarity of the MP4 format, coupled with its portability, has also enabled the illegal distribution of copyrighted audio-video files.

### 03**Is it possible to convert videos to MP4 without any software?**

No, it's impossible to do this conversion task without using any **YouTube to MP4** **video converter**. So you need to either get help from **free** **YouTube to MP4** **converter** or **YouTube MP4 converter HD** for the purpose.
