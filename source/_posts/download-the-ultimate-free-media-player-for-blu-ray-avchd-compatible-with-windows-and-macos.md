## Free M2TS Player for Blu-ray/AVCHD M2TS Files Playback

 _Posted by [Kaylee Wood](https://www.quora.com/profile/Amanda-Hu-21) | Last update: April 28, 2020_

It is quite a difficult task to play M2TS files, because many Windows and Mac operating systems don't support M2TS naturally. And M2TS doesn't make the list of major media players supported file formats. What to do if cannot play M2TS files? Download and install M2TS codec? It's really troublesome. Convert M2TS to common file formats? No. Instead, using a powerful **free M2TS Player** is the most direct and recommended approach for Blu-ray M2TS and AVCHD M2TS file playback. 

#### **What Is M2TS?**

M2TS is a container format commonly used for high definition video on Blu-ray Disc and AVCHD. Many popular HD camcorders, like Sony HDR-CX100, Sony DCR-SR47, JVC GZ-HD40, JVC GZ-HD10, Panasonic HDC-HS300, Panasonic HDC-HS20, Canon VIXIA HF200, Canon FS200, Canon VIXIA HFS100, Canon VIXIA HG21, etc. record videos in M2TS format. But when you transfer the M2TS files from camcorders to computers for playback, you find that your media player can't recognize and play M2TS files.
