While most videos nowadays are rectangular, and are recorded in either landscape or portrait orientation, there are some social media platforms that require the clips to be square shaped. If you want to upload your footages on such websites, it is essential to learn **how to change video shape**.

Another benefit of changing the shape of the recorded films is that they can be adjusted in limited amount of space, especially if they are to be posted on a website. Furthermore, some fancy designs such as star-shaped or circle-shaped videos attract more attention when used in digital marketing campaigns.

With that said, here you will learn **how to change the shape of a video** using one of the most advanced and versatile post-production tools, Wondershare Filmora.

Or, you just want to [transfer your video into vertical.](https://tools.techidaily.com/wondershare/filmora/download/)

## Part 1: How to Change Video Shape from Rectangle to Square

Depending on the recording device and the target audiences a video is intended to be distributed to, the aspect ratio of the produced footage could be 16:9, 4:3, or 21:9 that makes the film rectangular-shaped. Given that, the aspect ratio can be modified to change the film shape from rectangle to square.

The instructions given below explain **how to change video shape** from rectangle to square in Wondershare Filmora:

**Step 1: Import Video to Timeline**

Launch Wondershare Filmora on your PC (a Windows 10 computer is used here), click the **Add Files** icon from the center of the **Media** window present at the upper-left section, and use the **Open** box that appears to select and import the source video to Filmora. Next, drag the video from the **Media** window to the Timeline, and select your preferred option when/if the **Project Setting** confirmation box appears.

**Step 2: Change Aspect Ratio**

Select the video in the Timeline, and click the **Crop and Zoom** icon from the upper-left area of the Timeline itself. On the **Crop and Zoom** window that opens next, select **1:1** from the **Ratio** drop-down list, and click **OK** to save the new setting.

**Step 3: Export the Video**

Click **EXPORT** from the top-center area of the interface, go to the **Local** tab on the **Export** box, select your preferred format from the **Format** list in the left pane, optionally click **SETTINGS** from the right window to make other adjustments if necessary, and click **EXPORT** from the bottom-right corner of the box.

For more details, please refer to this article: [How to Resize a Video to Right Aspect Ratio and Size.](https://tools.techidaily.com/wondershare/filmora/download/)

## Part 2: Change Video Shape by Cropping

If your preferred aspect ratio isn’t available in the ‘Ratio’ drop-down list of the ‘Crop and Zoom’ window, Wondershare Filmora allows you to manually change the video to a custom shape.

In addition, drag the **X** and **Y**, and **Width**, **Height**, and **Feather** sliders to adjust the mask’s position, size, and edge smoothness respectively.

**Step 3: Customize Image Mask**

On the Timeline, double-click the video layer you applied **Image Mask** to, and notice all the available shapes available under the **Preset Mask** section on the **Video Effects** \> **Image Mask** window that appears at the upper-left area. You can double-click any of the available shape presets to apply it to the video layer. In addition, drag the **X** and **Y**, and **Width**, **Height**, and **Feather** sliders to adjust the mask’s position, size, and edge smoothness respectively. You can also check the **Invert Mask** box to reverse the masking effect on the video. Finally, click **OK** to save the changes, and follow the method explained in earlier parts to export the video.

#### Shape Masking

The following steps explain **how to change the shape of a video** with shape masks in Filmora:

**Step 1: Get to the Utility Window**

Add at two footages on their individual layers in the Timeline (make sure to place the second layer above the first one), and follow the method explained above to get to the **Effects** \> **Utility** window.

**Step 2: Add Shape Mask**

Drag **Shape Mask** from the **Utility** window, and drop it on top of the video itself in the Timeline. Confirm that the **_fx_** icon appears on the video layer to ensure that the effect has been applied.

**Step 3: Customize Shape Mask**

Double-click the video layer in the Timeline you applied shape mask to. On the **Video Effects** \> **Shape Mask** window, use the **X** and **Y**, and **Width**, **Height**, and **Feather** sliders to adjust the mask’s position, size and edge smoothness respectively. Optionally check the **Invert Mask** box to reverse the masking effect, and click **OK** to save the settings. Next, follow the method explained earlier to export the video.

**FAQs**

**1\. What’s the difference between Image Mask and Shape Mask in Filmora?**

A) In Filmora, Image Mask allows you to use an image (or any available preset) for masking so that the background footage is cropped to the shape of the picture. This is generally used to create logos and dynamic titles for movies or documentaries. On the other hand, Shape Mask enables you to mask the background clip with the foreground footage in the form of a shape that could be positioned and customized using the available sliders.

**2\. How many image masks are available in Filmora?**

A) At the time of this writing, Wondershare Filmora has around 40 image mask presets. In addition, it also allows you to add custom images from your PC for more dynamic approach.

04 [How to Trim Mp3 on Windows 10 Easily](#Part 4)

## Part 1 **6 Best Free MP3 Converter for Windows 10 / 11**

As promised, we start this off with the best **audio converter** (**Windows 10**/11) tools. We've decided to go very simple with this list, providing a brief description of all of the FREE **MP3 Converters** (**Windows**), a URL that will lead you to the website where you can get the converter, and an image that should show you how the converter's interface looks like.

### 01**EaseUs MobiMover**

EaseUs MobiMover is an **audio converter for Windows 10** and 11 that you can use in order to easily convert videos (in various formats) into MP3 (as is shown in the image below. It's a FREEmium software though — which means that it's use is limited until you purchase the paid version of the software.

![EaseUs MobiMover - MP3 Converter](https://images.wondershare.com/filmora/article-images/2021/why-this-article-about-mp3-converter-windows-deserves-to-read%201.png)

### 02**Freemake Video Converter**

Freemake Video Converter is the first 100% FREE **MP3 converter for Windows 10** on this list! They keep the software updated from donations, so you can choose how much money you can spare for using the service! It's a very simple software besides (as is shown in the image below). It does feature some video editing tools, but its main function is conversion (which includes video-to-audio conversion!)

![Freemake Video Converter](https://images.wondershare.com/filmora/article-images/2021/why-this-article-about-mp3-converter-windows-deserves-to-read%202.png)

### 03**VSDC**

Much like Freemake, our next **MP3 converter for Windows 10** and 11, called VSDC, is completely FREE — as they run primarily on donations. That does mean that it's not the most advanced program though — evident from the rather old-school interface (shown in the image below). But, regardless of the lack of abundance in tools, it should function just fine as an **audio-video-converter for Windows 10** (and vice versa.)

![VSDC - MP3 Converter](https://images.wondershare.com/filmora/article-images/2021/why-this-article-about-mp3-converter-windows-deserves-to-read%203.png)

### 04**Convertio.co**

With Convertio.co, we break the mold a bit! This is not a software, but it does still work for Windows users — as it requires only that you have a working browser from which you can access the website (URL linked below!) As you can see from the image, it works much like most online MP3 converters — you upload a file from your desktop, wait for it to finish converting, and then download it!

![Convertio - MP3 Converter](https://images.wondershare.com/filmora/article-images/2021/why-this-article-about-mp3-converter-windows-deserves-to-read%204.png)

### 05**Free Convert**

Free Convert is another online **MP3 convert for Windows 10** users that would prefer not to download or install software. And, just like Covertio, it works by uploading the files you want to convert from your computer, waiting for the converters tool to finish converting it, and then downloading the finished product. It is, of course, FREE — but, similar to the first tool on this list, if you want to unlock some of its features, you'll have to pay for the premium version.

![Free Convert - MP3 Converter](https://images.wondershare.com/filmora/article-images/2021/why-this-article-about-mp3-converter-windows-deserves-to-read%205.png)

### 06**DVDVideoSoft**

With DVDVideoSoft, we're back to an **audio-video converter for Windows 10** that you have to download and install to work! It's a FREEmium software too. That means that you'll have to pay in order to unlock certain features. But, it works as a solid converter even without that.

![DVDVideoSoft](https://images.wondershare.com/filmora/article-images/2021/why-this-article-about-mp3-converter-windows-deserves-to-read%206.png)

## Part 2 **6 Best Free and Paid Audio Editor for PC and Mac**

For this next section, we turn our attention to a couple of **MP3 editors** (**Windows 10** and Mac compatible.) This list will be a little more detailed than the first, since there are many differences between the tools that we'll be introducing (both FREE and PAID), but it should give you a clear idea on which would work best for you.

### 02**Audacity**

Operating System: Windows/Mac/Linux

Today's Best Deals: FREE

Audacity is an **MP3 editor (Windows 10**, Max, and Linux compatible!) The difference between this tool and our first pick, Filmora Pro, is that Audacity is an open-source software — this means that it is free to use, but it also means that it might not be the most reliable as it is not updated quite as often.

**Reasons to Buy:**

**●** FREE, open-source software

**●** Advanced video and audio editing tools

**●** MP3 trimming/cutting feature

**Reasons to Avoid:**

**●** Not updated as often

**●** Confusing interface

![Audacity](https://images.wondershare.com/filmora/article-images/2021/why-this-article-about-mp3-converter-windows-deserves-to-read%208.png)

### 03**Ashampoo Music Studio 8**

Operating System: Windows

Today's Best Deals: US$29.99

Next up is Ashampoo's Music Studio 8! Here's another freemium software that you can try for free — just to make sure it's the tool that you're looking for, but you'll have to pay a price to use in its entirety! As you can see from the interface (shown in the image below) though, it's quite the effective **MP3 cutter for Windows 10** (among other things). So, if that's what you're looking for, then it's a good choice to consider.

**Reasons to Buy:**

**●** Clean, modern interface

**●** Beginner-friendly editing tools

**●** One-time fee only

**Reasons to Avoid:**

**●** Freemium software (one-time payment required)

**●** Available only for Windows!

![Music Studio](https://images.wondershare.com/filmora/article-images/2021/why-this-article-about-mp3-converter-windows-deserves-to-read%209.png)

### 04**Ocenaudio**

Operating System: Windows/Mac/Linux

Today's Best Deals: FREE

As far as audio-editing goes, you're probably going to have a difficult time finding one that is as specialized as Ocenaudio. As you can probably guess from the name, it is, primarily, an audio editing tool. Making it a good choice if that's all you're looking for in a software, as it certainly keeps things simpler.

**Reasons to Buy:**

**●** Beginner-friendly audio editor

**●** Simple, clean interface

**●** Available for Windows/Mac/Linux

**Reasons to Avoid:**

**●** Older software

**●** Open-source, not updated as often

### 05**Acoustica**

Operating System: Windows

Today's Best Deals: FREE

Our next pick is another open-source, **MP3 editor for Windows 10**. It's called Acoustica. And, as you can see from the image shared below, it's a fairly advanced audio editing tool. You should note, however, that the newer versions of this product are PAID (only older models are free), which is the topic of our discussion today.

**Reasons to Buy:**

**●** FREE, open-source product

**●** Advanced audio editing tools

**●** Advanced exporting formats

**Reasons to Avoid:**

**●** Older version of the software

**●** Updated version is PAID

**●** Available only for Windows

![Acoustica](https://images.wondershare.com/filmora/article-images/2021/why-this-article-about-mp3-converter-windows-deserves-to-read%2011.png)

### 06**Audiotool**

Operating System: Windows/Mac/Linux

Today's Best Deals: FREE

Finally, we finish things off with Audiotool, it's certainly not your traditional audio editor (as is evident from the image shown below). But, the funky interface doesn't mean that it won't work for you! You never know, it might be exactly the kind that helps you zoom through your projects more quickly.

**Reasons to Buy:**

**●** FREE, open-source software

**●** Available for Windows/Mac/Linux users

**●** Advanced audio editing

**Reasons to Avoid:**

**●** Complex editing interface

**●** Requires internet to work (Linux)

**●** Not regularly updated

## Part 3 **5 MP3 Music Players for Windows 10/11 PC**

The last of the lists in this article is a short one for the best **MP3 players for Windows 10**! This is a straightforward list, much like the first. And, we'll be focusing on **MP3 players for Windows 10** only (although some of these will work for Mac as well!)

### 01**iTunes**

Despite appearances, iTunes actually makes for a great **MP3 player for Windows 10** users. After all, it's interface is clean and it is regularly updated. So, you never have to deal with bugs! (And just in case you weren't aware, you can add your own original audio to your iTunes library! So, it isn't like you have to purchase media from the iTunes store just to listen to it.)

![iTunes](https://images.wondershare.com/filmora/article-images/2021/why-this-article-about-mp3-converter-windows-deserves-to-read%2013.png)

### 02**Groove Music**

Groove Music is a local **Mp3 player for Windows 10** that you can download from the Microsoft App Store. It functions much like iTunes — in that you can add original music or audio to the app library (as well as purchase audio from the store — if that's what you want.)

![Groove Music](https://images.wondershare.com/filmora/article-images/2021/why-this-article-about-mp3-converter-windows-deserves-to-read%2014.png)

### 03**Macgo Media Player**

Our next pick, Macgo, is not strictly an **MP3 player for Windows 10**, but it can work for that purpose if that's all you need it for. As a media player though, it does function as a video player as well. And, like our previous picks, it's FREE so you don't have to worry about paying in order to use it.

![Macgo Media Player](https://images.wondershare.com/filmora/article-images/2021/why-this-article-about-mp3-converter-windows-deserves-to-read%2015.png)

### 04**PowerDVD**

Again, our next pick is more of a general media player than strictly a **MP3 Player for Windows 10** users, but it works just as well if all you're looking for is to occasionally play the audio that you've converted or trimmed!

![PowerDVD](https://images.wondershare.com/filmora/article-images/2021/why-this-article-about-mp3-converter-windows-deserves-to-read%2016.png)

### 05**Musicbee**

We're back to strictly **MP3 players for Windows** with Musicbee! The best part of this app is, undoubtedly, the fact that it has several view options. So, if you want, you have your audio playing from a mini audio player (rather than the full interface — as is shown below). It's also useful for organizing your media collection!

![MusicBee](https://images.wondershare.com/filmora/article-images/2021/why-this-article-about-mp3-converter-windows-deserves-to-read%2017.png)

## Part 4 **How to Trim Mp3 on Windows 10 Easily**

For this next part, we're going to go over how you might go about trimming your converted audio with an **MP3 cutter for Windows**. (Note, a lot of the audio editors that we introduced in Part 2 of this article should be capable of this! And, they all work in much the same way.)

### 01**Step 1: Launch MP3 Cutter for Windows 10! Start!**

First, launch the **MP3 cutter for Windows 10** that you downloaded.

For this example, we'll be using Joyoshare Media Cutter. And, the way to start is to select the "Open" button, which will prompt you to choose which audio you want to cut.

![Launch MP3 Audio Trimmer](https://images.wondershare.com/filmora/article-images/2021/why-this-article-about-mp3-converter-windows-deserves-to-read%2018.png)

### 02**Step 2: Choose Output Option**

Next, select the output format that you want your audio to be exported in. (Most **MP3 cutters for Windows 10** offers a variety for you to choose from).

![Select Output Format Window](https://images.wondershare.com/filmora/article-images/2021/why-this-article-about-mp3-converter-windows-deserves-to-read%2019.png)

### 03**Step 3: Select and Trim Mode!**

Joyoshare has two methods of trimming available. The first is the select and trim mode, which is shown in the image below! For this, you use the sliders provider to select which portion of the audio you want to keep!

![Basic Audio Trimming Options](https://images.wondershare.com/filmora/article-images/2021/why-this-article-about-mp3-converter-windows-deserves-to-read%2020.png)

### 04**Step 4: Use Encoder Trimmer**

If you want a cleaner trim, you click the "Edit" icon beside the audio that you want to trim until you are moved to the encoder window (shown in the image below). This will allow you to pinpoint the best place to cut your audio!

![Advanced Encoding Trimming Options](https://images.wondershare.com/filmora/article-images/2021/why-this-article-about-mp3-converter-windows-deserves-to-read%2021.png)

### 05**Step 5: Save Your Audio!**

Once you're done trimming, remember to save!

With Joyoshare, the method of doing this is to select the "Start" button, which will prompt the trimmer to begin cutting the audio.

![Save Finished Audio](https://images.wondershare.com/filmora/article-images/2021/why-this-article-about-mp3-converter-windows-deserves-to-read%2022.png)

### 06**Audiotool**

Operating System: Windows/Mac/Linux

Finally, we finish things off with Audiotool, it's certainly not your traditional audio editor (as is evident from the image shown below).

**Reasons to Buy:**

**●** FREE, open-source software

## Part 3 **5 MP3 Music Players for Windows 10/11 PC**

The last of the lists in this article is a short one for the best **MP3 players for Windows 10**! This is a straightforward list, much like the first. And, we'll be focusing on **MP3 players for Windows 10** only (although some of these will work for Mac as well!)

### 01**iTunes**

Despite appearances, iTunes actually makes for a great **MP3 player for Windows 10** users. After all, it's interface is clean and it is regularly updated. So, you never have to deal with bugs! (And just in case you weren't aware, you can add your own original audio to your iTunes library! So, it isn't like you have to purchase media from the iTunes store just to listen to it.)

![iTunes](https://images.wondershare.com/filmora/article-images/2021/why-this-article-about-mp3-converter-windows-deserves-to-read%2013.png)

### 02**Groove Music**

Groove Music is a local **Mp3 player for Windows 10** that you can download from the Microsoft App Store. It functions much like iTunes — in that you can add original music or audio to the app library (as well as purchase audio from the store — if that's what you want.)

![Groove Music](https://images.wondershare.com/filmora/article-images/2021/why-this-article-about-mp3-converter-windows-deserves-to-read%2014.png)

### 03**Macgo Media Player**

Our next pick, Macgo, is not strictly an **MP3 player for Windows 10**, but it can work for that purpose if that's all you need it for. As a media player though, it does function as a video player as well. And, like our previous picks, it's FREE so you don't have to worry about paying in order to use it.

![Macgo Media Player](https://images.wondershare.com/filmora/article-images/2021/why-this-article-about-mp3-converter-windows-deserves-to-read%2015.png)

### 04**PowerDVD**

Again, our next pick is more of a general media player than strictly a **MP3 Player for Windows 10** users, but it works just as well if all you're looking for is to occasionally play the audio that you've converted or trimmed!

![PowerDVD](https://images.wondershare.com/filmora/article-images/2021/why-this-article-about-mp3-converter-windows-deserves-to-read%2016.png)

### 05**Musicbee**

We're back to strictly **MP3 players for Windows** with Musicbee! The best part of this app is, undoubtedly, the fact that it has several view options. So, if you want, you have your audio playing from a mini audio player (rather than the full interface — as is shown below). It's also useful for organizing your media collection!

![MusicBee](https://images.wondershare.com/filmora/article-images/2021/why-this-article-about-mp3-converter-windows-deserves-to-read%2017.png)

## Part 4 **How to Trim Mp3 on Windows 10 Easily**

For this next part, we're going to go over how you might go about trimming your converted audio with an **MP3 cutter for Windows**. (Note, a lot of the audio editors that we introduced in Part 2 of this article should be capable of this! And, they all work in much the same way.)

### 01**Step 1: Launch MP3 Cutter for Windows 10! Start!**

First, launch the **MP3 cutter for Windows 10** that you downloaded.

For this example, we'll be using Joyoshare Media Cutter. And, the way to start is to select the "Open" button, which will prompt you to choose which audio you want to cut.

![Launch MP3 Audio Trimmer](https://images.wondershare.com/filmora/article-images/2021/why-this-article-about-mp3-converter-windows-deserves-to-read%2018.png)

### 02**Step 2: Choose Output Option**

Next, select the output format that you want your audio to be exported in. (Most **MP3 cutters for Windows 10** offers a variety for you to choose from).

![Select Output Format Window](https://images.wondershare.com/filmora/article-images/2021/why-this-article-about-mp3-converter-windows-deserves-to-read%2019.png)

### 03**Step 3: Select and Trim Mode!**

Joyoshare has two methods of trimming available. The first is the select and trim mode, which is shown in the image below! For this, you use the sliders provider to select which portion of the audio you want to keep!

![Basic Audio Trimming Options](https://images.wondershare.com/filmora/article-images/2021/why-this-article-about-mp3-converter-windows-deserves-to-read%2020.png)

### 04**Step 4: Use Encoder Trimmer**

If you want a cleaner trim, you click the "Edit" icon beside the audio that you want to trim until you are moved to the encoder window (shown in the image below). This will allow you to pinpoint the best place to cut your audio!

![Advanced Encoding Trimming Options](https://images.wondershare.com/filmora/article-images/2021/why-this-article-about-mp3-converter-windows-deserves-to-read%2021.png)

### 05**Step 5: Save Your Audio!**

Once you're done trimming, remember to save!

With Joyoshare, the method of doing this is to select the "Start" button, which will prompt the trimmer to begin cutting the audio.

![Save Finished Audio](https://images.wondershare.com/filmora/article-images/2021/why-this-article-about-mp3-converter-windows-deserves-to-read%2022.png)

## Key Takeaways from This Episode

**●** Just in case you want to review what your converted audio sounds like, consider one of the audio players that are available for Windows and Mac!

**●** If you find that your audio needs some trimming, a quick trim with an audio cutter should do the trick. It's very simple to do!

04 [How to Trim Mp3 on Windows 10 Easily](#Part 4)

## Part 1 **6 Best Free MP3 Converter for Windows 10 / 11**

As promised, we start this off with the best **audio converter** (**Windows 10**/11) tools. We've decided to go very simple with this list, providing a brief description of all of the FREE **MP3 Converters** (**Windows**), a URL that will lead you to the website where you can get the converter, and an image that should show you how the converter's interface looks like.

### 01**EaseUs MobiMover**

EaseUs MobiMover is an **audio converter for Windows 10** and 11 that you can use in order to easily convert videos (in various formats) into MP3 (as is shown in the image below. It's a FREEmium software though — which means that it's use is limited until you purchase the paid version of the software.

![EaseUs MobiMover - MP3 Converter](https://images.wondershare.com/filmora/article-images/2021/why-this-article-about-mp3-converter-windows-deserves-to-read%201.png)

### 02**Freemake Video Converter**

Freemake Video Converter is the first 100% FREE **MP3 converter for Windows 10** on this list! They keep the software updated from donations, so you can choose how much money you can spare for using the service! It's a very simple software besides (as is shown in the image below). It does feature some video editing tools, but its main function is conversion (which includes video-to-audio conversion!)

![Freemake Video Converter](https://images.wondershare.com/filmora/article-images/2021/why-this-article-about-mp3-converter-windows-deserves-to-read%202.png)

### 03**VSDC**

Much like Freemake, our next **MP3 converter for Windows 10** and 11, called VSDC, is completely FREE — as they run primarily on donations. That does mean that it's not the most advanced program though — evident from the rather old-school interface (shown in the image below). But, regardless of the lack of abundance in tools, it should function just fine as an **audio-video-converter for Windows 10** (and vice versa.)

![VSDC - MP3 Converter](https://images.wondershare.com/filmora/article-images/2021/why-this-article-about-mp3-converter-windows-deserves-to-read%203.png)

### 04**Convertio.co**

With Convertio.co, we break the mold a bit! This is not a software, but it does still work for Windows users — as it requires only that you have a working browser from which you can access the website (URL linked below!) As you can see from the image, it works much like most online MP3 converters — you upload a file from your desktop, wait for it to finish converting, and then download it!

![Convertio - MP3 Converter](https://images.wondershare.com/filmora/article-images/2021/why-this-article-about-mp3-converter-windows-deserves-to-read%204.png)

### 05**Free Convert**

Free Convert is another online **MP3 convert for Windows 10** users that would prefer not to download or install software. And, just like Covertio, it works by uploading the files you want to convert from your computer, waiting for the converters tool to finish converting it, and then downloading the finished product. It is, of course, FREE — but, similar to the first tool on this list, if you want to unlock some of its features, you'll have to pay for the premium version.

![Free Convert - MP3 Converter](https://images.wondershare.com/filmora/article-images/2021/why-this-article-about-mp3-converter-windows-deserves-to-read%205.png)

### 06**DVDVideoSoft**

With DVDVideoSoft, we're back to an **audio-video converter for Windows 10** that you have to download and install to work! It's a FREEmium software too. That means that you'll have to pay in order to unlock certain features. But, it works as a solid converter even without that.

![DVDVideoSoft](https://images.wondershare.com/filmora/article-images/2021/why-this-article-about-mp3-converter-windows-deserves-to-read%206.png)

## Part 2 **6 Best Free and Paid Audio Editor for PC and Mac**

For this next section, we turn our attention to a couple of **MP3 editors** (**Windows 10** and Mac compatible.) This list will be a little more detailed than the first, since there are many differences between the tools that we'll be introducing (both FREE and PAID), but it should give you a clear idea on which would work best for you.

### 01**Wondershare Filmora**

Operating System: Windows/Mac

Today's Best Deals: US$89.99 (one-time)

The first on our list is the **MP3 editor Windows 10** and Mac compatible, [Wondershare Filmora Video Editor](https://tools.techidaily.com/wondershare/filmora/download/) This is an advanced video editing software that you can use in order to work on just about any digital project — including, of course, editing your MP3 audio files.

### 02**Audacity**

Operating System: Windows/Mac/Linux

Today's Best Deals: FREE

Audacity is an **MP3 editor (Windows 10**, Max, and Linux compatible!) The difference between this tool and our first pick, Filmora Pro, is that Audacity is an open-source software — this means that it is free to use, but it also means that it might not be the most reliable as it is not updated quite as often.

**Reasons to Buy:**

**●** FREE, open-source software

**●** Advanced video and audio editing tools

**●** MP3 trimming/cutting feature

**Reasons to Avoid:**

**●** Not updated as often

**●** Confusing interface

**●** Difficult to use for beginners

![Audacity](https://images.wondershare.com/filmora/article-images/2021/why-this-article-about-mp3-converter-windows-deserves-to-read%208.png)

Operating System: Windows

Today's Best Deals: US$29.99

Next up is Ashampoo's Music Studio 8! Here's another freemium software that you can try for free — just to make sure it's the tool that you're looking for, but you'll have to pay a price to use in its entirety! As you can see from the interface (shown in the image below) though, it's quite the effective **MP3 cutter for Windows 10** (among other things). So, if that's what you're looking for, then it's a good choice to consider.

**Reasons to Buy:**

**●** Clean, modern interface

**●** Beginner-friendly editing tools

**●** One-time fee only

**Reasons to Avoid:**

**●** Freemium software (one-time payment required)

**●** Available only for Windows!

![Music Studio](https://images.wondershare.com/filmora/article-images/2021/why-this-article-about-mp3-converter-windows-deserves-to-read%209.png)

### 04**Ocenaudio**

Operating System: Windows/Mac/Linux

Today's Best Deals: FREE

As far as audio-editing goes, you're probably going to have a difficult time finding one that is as specialized as Ocenaudio. As you can probably guess from the name, it is, primarily, an audio editing tool. Making it a good choice if that's all you're looking for in a software, as it certainly keeps things simpler.

**Reasons to Buy:**

**●** Beginner-friendly audio editor

**●** Simple, clean interface

**●** Available for Windows/Mac/Linux

**Reasons to Avoid:**

**●** Older software

**●** Open-source, not updated as often

![Free Convert - MP3 Converter](https://images.wondershare.com/filmora/article-images/2021/why-this-article-about-mp3-converter-windows-deserves-to-read%205.png)

### 06**DVDVideoSoft**

With DVDVideoSoft, we're back to an **audio-video converter for Windows 10** that you have to download and install to work! It's a FREEmium software too. That means that you'll have to pay in order to unlock certain features. But, it works as a solid converter even without that.

## Part 2 **6 Best Free and Paid Audio Editor for PC and Mac**

For this next section, we turn our attention to a couple of **MP3 editors** (**Windows 10** and Mac compatible.)

### 02**Audacity**

Operating System: Windows/Mac/Linux

Today's Best Deals: FREE

Audacity is an **MP3 editor (Windows 10**, Max, and Linux compatible!) The difference between this tool and our first pick, Filmora Pro, is that Audacity is an open-source software — this means that it is free to use, but it also means that it might not be the most reliable as it is not updated quite as often.

**Reasons to Buy:**

**●** FREE, open-source software

**●** Advanced video and audio editing tools

**●** MP3 trimming/cutting feature

**Reasons to Avoid:**

**●** Not updated as often

So, if that's what you're looking for, then it's a good choice to consider.

**Reasons to Buy:**

**●** Clean, modern interface

**●** Beginner-friendly editing tools

Operating System: Windows/Mac/Linux

Today's Best Deals: FREE

As far as audio-editing goes, you're probably going to have a difficult time finding one that is as specialized as Ocenaudio. As you can probably guess from the name, it is, primarily, an audio editing tool. Making it a good choice if that's all you're looking for in a software, as it certainly keeps things simpler.

**Reasons to Buy:**

**●** Beginner-friendly audio editor

**●** Simple, clean interface

**●** Available for Windows/Mac/Linux

### 06**Audiotool**

Operating System: Windows/Mac/Linux

Today's Best Deals: FREE

Finally, we finish things off with Audiotool, it's certainly not your traditional audio editor (as is evident from the image shown below).

## Part 3 **5 MP3 Music Players for Windows 10/11 PC**

The last of the lists in this article is a short one for the best **MP3 players for Windows 10**! This is a straightforward list, much like the first. And, we'll be focusing on **MP3 players for Windows 10** only (although some of these will work for Mac as well!)

### 01**iTunes**

Despite appearances, iTunes actually makes for a great **MP3 player for Windows 10** users. After all, it's interface is clean and it is regularly updated. So, you never have to deal with bugs! (And just in case you weren't aware, you can add your own original audio to your iTunes library! So, it isn't like you have to purchase media from the iTunes store just to listen to it.)

![iTunes](https://images.wondershare.com/filmora/article-images/2021/why-this-article-about-mp3-converter-windows-deserves-to-read%2013.png)

### 02**Groove Music**

Groove Music is a local **Mp3 player for Windows 10** that you can download from the Microsoft App Store. It functions much like iTunes — in that you can add original music or audio to the app library (as well as purchase audio from the store — if that's what you want.)

![Groove Music](https://images.wondershare.com/filmora/article-images/2021/why-this-article-about-mp3-converter-windows-deserves-to-read%2014.png)

### 03**Macgo Media Player**

Our next pick, Macgo, is not strictly an **MP3 player for Windows 10**, but it can work for that purpose if that's all you need it for. As a media player though, it does function as a video player as well. And, like our previous picks, it's FREE so you don't have to worry about paying in order to use it.

![Macgo Media Player](https://images.wondershare.com/filmora/article-images/2021/why-this-article-about-mp3-converter-windows-deserves-to-read%2015.png)

### 04**PowerDVD**

Again, our next pick is more of a general media player than strictly a **MP3 Player for Windows 10** users, but it works just as well if all you're looking for is to occasionally play the audio that you've converted or trimmed!

![PowerDVD](https://images.wondershare.com/filmora/article-images/2021/why-this-article-about-mp3-converter-windows-deserves-to-read%2016.png)

### 05**Musicbee**

We're back to strictly **MP3 players for Windows** with Musicbee! The best part of this app is, undoubtedly, the fact that it has several view options. So, if you want, you have your audio playing from a mini audio player (rather than the full interface — as is shown below). It's also useful for organizing your media collection!

![MusicBee](https://images.wondershare.com/filmora/article-images/2021/why-this-article-about-mp3-converter-windows-deserves-to-read%2017.png)

## Part 4 **How to Trim Mp3 on Windows 10 Easily**

For this next part, we're going to go over how you might go about trimming your converted audio with an **MP3 cutter for Windows**. (Note, a lot of the audio editors that we introduced in Part 2 of this article should be capable of this! And, they all work in much the same way.)

### 01**Step 1: Launch MP3 Cutter for Windows 10! Start!**

First, launch the **MP3 cutter for Windows 10** that you downloaded.

For this example, we'll be using Joyoshare Media Cutter. And, the way to start is to select the "Open" button, which will prompt you to choose which audio you want to cut.

![Launch MP3 Audio Trimmer](https://images.wondershare.com/filmora/article-images/2021/why-this-article-about-mp3-converter-windows-deserves-to-read%2018.png)

### 02**Step 2: Choose Output Option**

Next, select the output format that you want your audio to be exported in. (Most **MP3 cutters for Windows 10** offers a variety for you to choose from).

![Select Output Format Window](https://images.wondershare.com/filmora/article-images/2021/why-this-article-about-mp3-converter-windows-deserves-to-read%2019.png)

### 03**Step 3: Select and Trim Mode!**

Joyoshare has two methods of trimming available. The first is the select and trim mode, which is shown in the image below! For this, you use the sliders provider to select which portion of the audio you want to keep!

![Basic Audio Trimming Options](https://images.wondershare.com/filmora/article-images/2021/why-this-article-about-mp3-converter-windows-deserves-to-read%2020.png)

### 04**Step 4: Use Encoder Trimmer**

If you want a cleaner trim, you click the "Edit" icon beside the audio that you want to trim until you are moved to the encoder window (shown in the image below). This will allow you to pinpoint the best place to cut your audio!

![Advanced Encoding Trimming Options](https://images.wondershare.com/filmora/article-images/2021/why-this-article-about-mp3-converter-windows-deserves-to-read%2021.png)

### 05**Step 5: Save Your Audio!**

Once you're done trimming, remember to save!

With Joyoshare, the method of doing this is to select the "Start" button, which will prompt the trimmer to begin cutting the audio.

![Save Finished Audio](https://images.wondershare.com/filmora/article-images/2021/why-this-article-about-mp3-converter-windows-deserves-to-read%2022.png)

## Adobe Premiere Pro Power-Ups: The Best Plugins (Free & Affordable)

# Top 15 Adobe Premiere Plugins for Effects and Transitions

![author avatar](https://images.wondershare.com/filmora/article-images/benjamin-arango-author.jpg)

##### Benjamin Arango

 Mar 27, 2024• Proven solutions

Although Premiere is a complete and robust platform, there is always room for customization, extras, and just plain cool add-ons that are too niche for Adobe to produce themselves.

For example, you can add [free Adobe Premiere title templates](https://tools.techidaily.com/wondershare/filmora/download/) to make your video excellent.

While everyone's list will be different depending on what they use Premiere for, here is my choice of tools and effects that I find the most useful.

* [**Part 1: Top 15 Adobe Premiere Pro Plugins for Transitions and Effects**](#part1)
* [**Part 2: FAQ about Adobe Premiere Plugins**](#part2)

## Best Alternative to Adobe Premiere - Filmora

The Premiere is excellent if you can find the best Adobe Premiere plugin at the time and money price.

If you want to edit videos easily, here we recommend using [Filmora](https://tools.techidaily.com/wondershare/filmora/download/). It is designed for pros who want to make video easily or want to enter a professional video editing level.

For transitions, it has various built-in creative tools to use, including dissolve, motion, zoom, and more. For effects, you can use cinematic effects without efforts.

Unlimited tracks can power up your story with various videos and audio. Free download it to have a try!

[![Download Win Version](https://images.wondershare.com/filmora/guide/download-btn-win-pro.png)](https://tools.techidaily.com/wondershare/filmora/download/)[Download Mac Version](https://images.wondershare.com/filmora/guide/download-btn-mac-pro.png)](https://tools.techidaily.com/wondershare/filmora/download/)

Before choosing a plugin, you should consider [compatibility](https://helpx.adobe.com/premiere-pro/compatibility.html) and [extensibility](https://helpx.adobe.com/premiere-pro/extensibility.html) in case the plugin is not working with Premiere. You can also visit the Adobe [partner finder database](https://www.adobe.com/partners.html) to have a closer relationship with developers around the world if you want to search for plugin partners

## Part 1: Top 15 Adobe Premiere Pro Plugins for Transitions and Effects

#### 1[After Effects](https://www.adobe.com/products/aftereffects.html)

Some may say this is cheating, but for me, this is the number one add-on for Premiere. There is a reason for this, and that is that After Effects enables you to create anything you can dream of wanting within the Premiere environment.

Graphics, transitions, titles and templates, composites and a myriad of other options can be created and imported directly into Premiere. They integrate perfectly and enable smooth transitions between a Premiere project, creating an effect or graphic in After Effects.

Other plugins appear in this list that are extremely capable of a specific scenario, but none of the breadth of ability that After Effects brings to the table.

It is the best Adobe Premiere plugins to download.

**Price**: $20.99/month

**Features**

* **Steep learning**: we have to admit that it is not easy to make Adobe Premiere plugins with Effects, but if you have learned how-to, you are the master.
* **Animation**: If you like animation style video, you can use it to make Adobe Premiere animation plugins.

![After Effects adobe plugin](https://images.wondershare.com/images/multimedia/video-editor/adobe-plugin-1.png)

#### 2[Neat Video](https://www.neatvideo.com/index.html?linkID=p7334)

Neat Video is a great plugin for Premiere, unlike After Effects it has a single function, and that is noise reduction. It is very good at it.

While Camera technology has advanced at a remarkable rate, there are still circumstances when even the best cameras available to us produce a video that is a little too noisy for its intended use, and this is where Neat Video steps in.

It works as a video filter from within the Premiere environment. It can be applied to a sequence in its entirety of any number of individual clips within the sequence as desired.

Although aimed at noise reduction for modern digital cameras, Neat Video is also very useful in the digitization process of older VHS or film stock. It can be used to clean up the resulting digital file.

**Price**: $74.9/month

**Features**

* **Underwater shots**: You can make underwater shots with this plug-in. With it, you can make your video more beautiful.
* **Accurate and efficient**: As the best Adobe Premiere plugin, it can offer you an accurate effect.

![free download Neat Video adobe plugins](https://images.wondershare.com/images/multimedia/video-editor/adobe-plugin-2.png)

#### 3[Final Effects](http://www.borisfx.com/Adobe/fecae/)

A utility box of effects and transitions if ever there was one, Final Effects integrates smoothly with Premiere and includes over 120 different items. If you want to broaden your effects library but do not have any specific requirements, then this is the product for you. I particularly like the 3D relief effect, but there is something in here for every type of project you can think.

**Price**: $2495 for all bundles

**Features**

* **Stylized looks**: it offers various filters to use
* **Auto-animating transitions**: you can make animation style transitions auto.

![Final Effects adobe plugin](https://images.wondershare.com/images/multimedia/video-editor/adobe-plugin-3.png)

#### 4[Magic Bullet Looks](https://www.amazon.com/gp/product/B00TG2IG36/ref=as%5Fli%5Ftl?ie=UTF8&tag=vs-flora-20&camp=1789&creative=9325&linkCode=as2&creativeASIN=B00TG2IG36&linkId=40a4862dea2acf5507b237e385f8d55e)

This is a wondrous plugin that is primarily a color finishing tool but includes a raft of options that make it much more useful. The color finishing is first class. It comes with over 100 included presets organized by category so you can quickly find the right one for your project, plus the ability to fine-tune and save the results as custom presets meaning the possibilities are endless to obtain the right unified look you wish for your project.

In addition, options for lens distortion and lighting enable either corrections or stylized looks to be implemented to complement the color choices made.

**Price**: $899

**Features**

* **Great compatibility**: it works well on Windows and Mac.
* **Price**: the price may be higher than we thought.

![download Magic Bullet Looks adobe plugin](https://images.wondershare.com/images/multimedia/video-editor/adobe-plugin-4.png)

#### 5[Flicker Free](http://digitalanarchy.com/Flicker/main.html)

This one is quite a specific plugin that won't be for everyone, but if you are a regular proponent of time-lapse or slow-motion footage, this is a plugin that will be your best friend for life. One of the time-lapse issues is the changing exposures during such filming that produce a flickering effect when viewed.

What flicker-free does is to normalize the exposure and remove the flicker. It not only works on time-lapse, but can solve similar issues with slow-motion filming, and even assist with the rolling effect you can get from LED lighting and computer monitors.

It works from within Premiere and comes with useful presets to make the process as simple as possible. However, they can all be individually tweaked where necessary to get the perfect results.

**Price**: $79/$99.

**Features**

* **Fluent workflow**: the working experience is great if you try it.
* Time-lapse: You can make the time-lapse or slow-motion video better by specific Premiere plugin.

![free download Flicker adobe plugin](https://images.wondershare.com/images/multimedia/video-editor/adobe-plugin-5.png)

#### 6[Damage](https://www.amazon.com/gp/product/B01N1JPCEW/ref=as%5Fli%5Ftl?ie=UTF8&tag=vs-flora-20&camp=1789&creative=9325&linkCode=as2&creativeASIN=B01N1JPCEW&linkId=01542ff77ba269b302237cf03a190f81)

Another great plugin that is very specific in its use, Damage is, despite the name, a non-destructive filter plugin that simulates the grain, glitches, scan lines, and grit of aged film stock. There are over 80 presets available to use, and whilst its use is not going to be hugely widespread, for producing that aged effect there is nothing better.

**Price**: $299

**Features**

* 5 tool kits: it includes 5 Adobe Premiere plug-ins

![Damage adobe plugin](https://images.wondershare.com/images/multimedia/video-editor/adobe-plugin-6.png)

[![Download Win Version](https://images.wondershare.com/filmora/guide/download-btn-win-pro.png)](https://tools.techidaily.com/wondershare/filmora/download/)[Download Mac Version](https://images.wondershare.com/filmora/guide/download-btn-mac-pro.png)](https://tools.techidaily.com/wondershare/filmora/download/)

#### 7[Rays](http://www.digitalfilmtools.com/rays/)

This is a nice plugin that allows the creation of, you've guessed it, Rays. That is light rays to be precise. Atmospheric, beautiful, they can be many things, but there is no questioning the effectiveness of this plugin at simulating light rays. It's outstanding, as this promotional image shows.

**Price**: $95

**Features**

* Rays only: if you love rays, this one won't let you regret it.
* Natural lights: this Premiere offers natural lights

![Rays free download adobe plugin](https://images.wondershare.com/images/multimedia/video-editor/adobe-plugin-7.png)

#### 8 [Coremelt](http://www.coremelt.com/products/coremelt-complete-v2.html)

Another 'box of tricks' style product, Coremelt includes a huge number over 220 of effects and transitions.

It's the sheer breadth of options within the package that makes this one a must for any aspiring video editor.

**Price**: $199

**Features**

* Well-designed: you can make great Adobe Premiere plugins as it is well designed. It is easy and quick to use.
* Various plugs: it offers over Premiere 220 plugins to download.

![Coremelt adobe plugin](https://images.wondershare.com/images/multimedia/video-editor/adobe-plugin-8.png)

#### 9[VitaScene](https://www.amazon.com/gp/product/B0147OKANG/ref=as%5Fli%5Ftl?ie=UTF8&tag=vs-flora-20&camp=1789&creative=9325&linkCode=as2&creativeASIN=B0147OKANG&linkId=61e1b9e2197cf8e36e012a4ea8f7c122)

This is a professional grade package of effects and transitions that raises the bar for what is possible. My favorite one is the tilt-shift that produces that toy-like landscape that has become popular within the photography world in recent years.

There are over 600 effects within the Vitascene package. It is not the cheapest out there by any means, but is aimed squarely at the professional output and has the quality to do it.

**Price**: $599

**Features**

* Customizable plugins: you can customize your plugins after downloading.
* High quality: all the plugins are HD quality

![adobe plugin](https://images.wondershare.com/images/multimedia/video-editor/adobe-plugin-9.png)

![adobe plugin](https://images.wondershare.com/images/multimedia/video-editor/adobe-plugin-10.png)

#### 11[FilmConvert](https://www.filmconvert.com/)

If you want to give your video clip a cinematic look quickly, here is another Adobe Premiere plugin you should know. FilmConvert can help you adjust your video color, so you won't spend much time making a color correction. You can also add film grain to your video within a few clicks.

Although Premiere is a complete and robust platform, there is always room for customization, extras, and just plain cool add-ons that are too niche for Adobe to produce themselves.

For example, you can add [free Adobe Premiere title templates](https://tools.techidaily.com/wondershare/filmora/download/) to make your video excellent.

While everyone's list will be different depending on what they use Premiere for, here is my choice of tools and effects that I find the most useful.

* [**Part 1: Top 15 Adobe Premiere Pro Plugins for Transitions and Effects**](#part1)
* [**Part 2: FAQ about Adobe Premiere Plugins**](#part2)

## Best Alternative to Adobe Premiere - Filmora

The Premiere is excellent if you can find the best Adobe Premiere plugin at the time and money price.

If you want to edit videos easily, here we recommend using [Filmora](https://tools.techidaily.com/wondershare/filmora/download/). It is designed for pros who want to make video easily or want to enter a professional video editing level.

For transitions, it has various built-in creative tools to use, including dissolve, motion, zoom, and more. For effects, you can use cinematic effects without efforts.

Unlimited tracks can power up your story with various videos and audio. Free download it to have a try!

## Part 1: Top 15 Adobe Premiere Pro Plugins for Transitions and Effects

#### 1[After Effects](https://www.adobe.com/products/aftereffects.html)

Some may say this is cheating, but for me, this is the number one add-on for Premiere. There is a reason for this, and that is that After Effects enables you to create anything you can dream of wanting within the Premiere environment.

Graphics, transitions, titles and templates, composites and a myriad of other options can be created and imported directly into Premiere. They integrate perfectly and enable smooth transitions between a Premiere project, creating an effect or graphic in After Effects.

Other plugins appear in this list that are extremely capable of a specific scenario, but none of the breadth of ability that After Effects brings to the table.

It is the best Adobe Premiere plugins to download.

**Price**: $20.99/month

**Features**

* **Steep learning**: we have to admit that it is not easy to make Adobe Premiere plugins with Effects, but if you have learned how-to, you are the master.
* **Animation**: If you like animation style video, you can use it to make Adobe Premiere animation plugins.

![After Effects adobe plugin](https://images.wondershare.com/images/multimedia/video-editor/adobe-plugin-1.png)

#### 2[Neat Video](https://www.neatvideo.com/index.html?linkID=p7334)

Neat Video is a great plugin for Premiere, unlike After Effects it has a single function, and that is noise reduction. It is very good at it.

While Camera technology has advanced at a remarkable rate, there are still circumstances when even the best cameras available to us produce a video that is a little too noisy for its intended use, and this is where Neat Video steps in.

It works as a video filter from within the Premiere environment. It can be applied to a sequence in its entirety of any number of individual clips within the sequence as desired.

Although aimed at noise reduction for modern digital cameras, Neat Video is also very useful in the digitization process of older VHS or film stock. It can be used to clean up the resulting digital file.

**Price**: $74.9/month

**Features**

* **Underwater shots**: You can make underwater shots with this plug-in. With it, you can make your video more beautiful.
* **Accurate and efficient**: As the best Adobe Premiere plugin, it can offer you an accurate effect.

![free download Neat Video adobe plugins](https://images.wondershare.com/images/multimedia/video-editor/adobe-plugin-2.png)

#### 3[Final Effects](http://www.borisfx.com/Adobe/fecae/)

A utility box of effects and transitions if ever there was one, Final Effects integrates smoothly with Premiere and includes over 120 different items. If you want to broaden your effects library but do not have any specific requirements, then this is the product for you. I particularly like the 3D relief effect, but there is something in here for every type of project you can think.

**Price**: $2495 for all bundles

**Features**

* **Stylized looks**: it offers various filters to use
* **Auto-animating transitions**: you can make animation style transitions auto.

#### 4[Magic Bullet Looks](https://www.amazon.com/gp/product/B00TG2IG36/ref=as%5Fli%5Ftl?ie=UTF8&tag=vs-flora-20&camp=1789&creative=9325&linkCode=as2&creativeASIN=B00TG2IG36&linkId=40a4862dea2acf5507b237e385f8d55e)

This is a wondrous plugin that is primarily a color finishing tool but includes a raft of options that make it much more useful. The color finishing is first class. It comes with over 100 included presets organized by category so you can quickly find the right one for your project, plus the ability to fine-tune and save the results as custom presets meaning the possibilities are endless to obtain the right unified look you wish for your project.

In addition, options for lens distortion and lighting enable either corrections or stylized looks to be implemented to complement the color choices made.

**Price**: $899

**Features**

* **Great compatibility**: it works well on Windows and Mac.
* **Price**: the price may be higher than we thought.

![download Magic Bullet Looks adobe plugin](https://images.wondershare.com/images/multimedia/video-editor/adobe-plugin-4.png)

#### 5[Flicker Free](http://digitalanarchy.com/Flicker/main.html)

This one is quite a specific plugin that won't be for everyone, but if you are a regular proponent of time-lapse or slow-motion footage, this is a plugin that will be your best friend for life. One of the time-lapse issues is the changing exposures during such filming that produce a flickering effect when viewed.

What flicker-free does is to normalize the exposure and remove the flicker. It not only works on time-lapse, but can solve similar issues with slow-motion filming, and even assist with the rolling effect you can get from LED lighting and computer monitors.

It works from within Premiere and comes with useful presets to make the process as simple as possible. However, they can all be individually tweaked where necessary to get the perfect results.

**Price**: $79/$99.

**Features**

* **Fluent workflow**: the working experience is great if you try it.
* Time-lapse: You can make the time-lapse or slow-motion video better by specific Premiere plugin.

Another great plugin that is very specific in its use, Damage is, despite the name, a non-destructive filter plugin that simulates the grain, glitches, scan lines, and grit of aged film stock. There are over 80 presets available to use, and whilst its use is not going to be hugely widespread, for producing that aged effect there is nothing better.

**Price**: $299

Although Premiere is a complete and robust platform, there is always room for customization, extras, and just plain cool add-ons that are too niche for Adobe to produce themselves.

For example, you can add [free Adobe Premiere title templates](https://tools.techidaily.com/wondershare/filmora/download/) to make your video excellent.

While everyone's list will be different depending on what they use Premiere for, here is my choice of tools and effects that I find the most useful.

## Part 1: Top 15 Adobe Premiere Pro Plugins for Transitions and Effects

#### 1[After Effects](https://www.adobe.com/products/aftereffects.html)

Some may say this is cheating, but for me, this is the number one add-on for Premiere. There is a reason for this, and that is that After Effects enables you to create anything you can dream of wanting within the Premiere environment.

Graphics, transitions, titles and templates, composites and a myriad of other options can be created and imported directly into Premiere. They integrate perfectly and enable smooth transitions between a Premiere project, creating an effect or graphic in After Effects.

Other plugins appear in this list that are extremely capable of a specific scenario, but none of the breadth of ability that After Effects brings to the table.

It is the best Adobe Premiere plugins to download.

**Price**: $20.99/month

**Features**

* **Steep learning**: we have to admit that it is not easy to make Adobe Premiere plugins with Effects, but if you have learned how-to, you are the master.
* **Animation**: If you like animation style video, you can use it to make Adobe Premiere animation plugins.

![After Effects adobe plugin](https://images.wondershare.com/images/multimedia/video-editor/adobe-plugin-1.png)

#### 2[Neat Video](https://www.neatvideo.com/index.html?linkID=p7334)

Neat Video is a great plugin for Premiere, unlike After Effects it has a single function, and that is noise reduction. It is very good at it.

While Camera technology has advanced at a remarkable rate, there are still circumstances when even the best cameras available to us produce a video that is a little too noisy for its intended use, and this is where Neat Video steps in.

It works as a video filter from within the Premiere environment. It can be applied to a sequence in its entirety of any number of individual clips within the sequence as desired.

Although aimed at noise reduction for modern digital cameras, Neat Video is also very useful in the digitization process of older VHS or film stock. It can be used to clean up the resulting digital file.

**Price**: $74.9/month

**Features**

* **Underwater shots**: You can make underwater shots with this plug-in. With it, you can make your video more beautiful.
* **Accurate and efficient**: As the best Adobe Premiere plugin, it can offer you an accurate effect.

![free download Neat Video adobe plugins](https://images.wondershare.com/images/multimedia/video-editor/adobe-plugin-2.png)

#### 3[Final Effects](http://www.borisfx.com/Adobe/fecae/)

A utility box of effects and transitions if ever there was one, Final Effects integrates smoothly with Premiere and includes over 120 different items. If you want to broaden your effects library but do not have any specific requirements, then this is the product for you. I particularly like the 3D relief effect, but there is something in here for every type of project you can think.

**Price**: $2495 for all bundles

**Features**

* **Stylized looks**: it offers various filters to use
* **Auto-animating transitions**: you can make animation style transitions auto.

![Final Effects adobe plugin](https://images.wondershare.com/images/multimedia/video-editor/adobe-plugin-3.png)

#### 4[Magic Bullet Looks](https://www.amazon.com/gp/product/B00TG2IG36/ref=as%5Fli%5Ftl?ie=UTF8&tag=vs-flora-20&camp=1789&creative=9325&linkCode=as2&creativeASIN=B00TG2IG36&linkId=40a4862dea2acf5507b237e385f8d55e)

This is a wondrous plugin that is primarily a color finishing tool but includes a raft of options that make it much more useful. The color finishing is first class. It comes with over 100 included presets organized by category so you can quickly find the right one for your project, plus the ability to fine-tune and save the results as custom presets meaning the possibilities are endless to obtain the right unified look you wish for your project.

In addition, options for lens distortion and lighting enable either corrections or stylized looks to be implemented to complement the color choices made.

**Price**: $899

**Features**

* **Great compatibility**: it works well on Windows and Mac.
* **Price**: the price may be higher than we thought.

![download Magic Bullet Looks adobe plugin](https://images.wondershare.com/images/multimedia/video-editor/adobe-plugin-4.png)

#### 5[Flicker Free](http://digitalanarchy.com/Flicker/main.html)

This one is quite a specific plugin that won't be for everyone, but if you are a regular proponent of time-lapse or slow-motion footage, this is a plugin that will be your best friend for life. One of the time-lapse issues is the changing exposures during such filming that produce a flickering effect when viewed.

What flicker-free does is to normalize the exposure and remove the flicker. It not only works on time-lapse, but can solve similar issues with slow-motion filming, and even assist with the rolling effect you can get from LED lighting and computer monitors.

It works from within Premiere and comes with useful presets to make the process as simple as possible. However, they can all be individually tweaked where necessary to get the perfect results.

**Price**: $79/$99.

**Features**

* **Fluent workflow**: the working experience is great if you try it.
* Time-lapse: You can make the time-lapse or slow-motion video better by specific Premiere plugin.

![free download Flicker adobe plugin](https://images.wondershare.com/images/multimedia/video-editor/adobe-plugin-5.png)

Another great plugin that is very specific in its use, Damage is, despite the name, a non-destructive filter plugin that simulates the grain, glitches, scan lines, and grit of aged film stock. There are over 80 presets available to use, and whilst its use is not going to be hugely widespread, for producing that aged effect there is nothing better.

**Price**: $299

**Features**

* 5 tool kits: it includes 5 Adobe Premiere plug-ins

![Damage adobe plugin](https://images.wondershare.com/images/multimedia/video-editor/adobe-plugin-6.png)

#### 7[Rays](http://www.digitalfilmtools.com/rays/)

This is a nice plugin that allows the creation of, you've guessed it, Rays. That is light rays to be precise. Atmospheric, beautiful, they can be many things, but there is no questioning the effectiveness of this plugin at simulating light rays. It's outstanding, as this promotional image shows.

**Price**: $95

**Features**

This is a professional grade package of effects and transitions that raises the bar for what is possible. My favorite one is the tilt-shift that produces that toy-like landscape that has become popular within the photography world in recent years.

There are over 600 effects within the Vitascene package. It is not the cheapest out there by any means, but is aimed squarely at the professional output and has the quality to do it.
