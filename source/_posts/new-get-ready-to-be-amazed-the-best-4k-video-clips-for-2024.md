#### 1\. Ocean Footage underwater sample

This one is first on my choice of 4K video sample for a couple of reasons, firstly I love the subject matter, and secondly from a technical perspective it is one of the best samples out there.

Filmed using a Red One camera, it displays the vibrancy and detail that we associate with 4K resolution at its best, the color depth of the fish and coral is astounding, and when the shot moves to a passing whale the sense of scale the resolution gives really shows what 4K is capable of, and why it is a step up from anything we have seen before.

#### 2\. Trailer for the movie ‘Elysium’

Very little movie production footage is easily available out there in 4K, but this is one of the exceptions. The full theatrical trailer for the movie in glorious Ultra HD, Why does this make the list? Well I think if you are wanting to see the benefits of 4K, then samples like the Ocean Footage one mentioned above really show off the technical prowess, but it is actual movies that most people will be wanting to use 4K kit for, and this gives you a very good indication of how much of an increase in clarity, detail and vibrancy can be gained by switching to 4K. The standard HD version of this trailer is readily available too, so this is something you could make a direct comparison with. The nature of the film, a sci-fi action film, also lends itself to 4K with lots of beautifully rendered CGI scenes in the trailer to look at.

### 3\. Timescapes

This is the trailer for an interesting project, filmed entirely in 4K and the work of one man, it is purported to be the first 4K film made available for sale. The film itself, and this trailer, is a simple concept, slow-motion and time lapse cinematography of the South West of America, taken as the director, Tom Lowe, travels around in his pickup truck. The concept itself makes for an interesting effect, but this sample is here because of the content. Watching the big expanses of nature flow by in 4K is simply mind blowing, here you really see the almost 3D effect so much resolution and detail bring to the medium, it isn’t like watching a video, it really is like looking out of a window at real life.

### 4\. Boat Scenes

There are actually several test videos on this subject, all of them do a good job of displaying 4K but for me it is the this one that focuses on passing boats against an expansive backdrop that is the one to look at. Again it shows the effect of 4K resolution when displaying the wider world around us, this time a harbor vista as the boat passes through it, detail can be seen in the water, the passengers on the boat and the backdrop, and the sense of realism and scale, which for me are the things that set 4K apart, are readily apparent here.

### 5\. Tears of Steel trailer

Another rare 4K movie trailer, this one again shows lots of very high quality CGI that really show off the capabilities of 4K at their best. Some great use of the depth of field that 4K emphasizes in a lot of the shots and overall provides a great insight into 4K and what you can expect from it. An interesting video that also manages to tell a little story as well as being a showcase.

### 6\. Sintel

Sintel is an animated short created in the blender animation program, here in 4K it represents a fantastic look into what 4K can offer all forms of media, the opening scene, with the snow blowing in the wind, for instance, enables you to see incredible detail that just isn’t visible within the standard HD version. Seeing individual flies as the character searches through the wreckage of a town is another high point in terms of technical prowess.

Another feature of Sintel is its soft focus look that accentuates the high resolution, and makes this video stand out from others in the list. The small dragon is well animated and the main characters features, particularly the hair, are incredibly well realized. A great way to showcase your 4K equipment.

### 7\. Stock Footage Sample

This one is an amalgam of short clips from commercial stock footage that is used a sample of the product. That doesn’t make it any less of a fantastic 4K clip however, with footage chosen specifically to show off the benefits of 4K at its very best (it is a promotional package after all) there is something here for everyone. From the glorious colors of a sunrise to the explosions and the amazing time lapse, with, again, fantastic and vibrant colors, a real showcase for 4K in the true sense of the word.

### 8\. Honey Bees

Back to nature for this one, and the eponymous Honey Bee. Showing not only the color rendition and detail of the surroundings, it also captures the Bees themselves in incredible fidelity, the wing detail, especially on the close-ups, is just way beyond anything we have seen from moving images before, high resolution stills? Certainly, but not video. Another great advert for 4K footage and a lovely film as well.

#### 9\. Skyfall Trailer

Can’t say I’m much of a fan of the films, but as a way to see what very fast action looks like in 4K this is a great one. Unlike the other movie trailers, this one isn’t full of CGI, so it shows a different aspect of 4K movies here, the real-life stunts performed by traditional stunt professionals is what this one is all about. And it doesn’t let us down, crashes, explosions and car chases, everything that Bond is about. Except in 4K. Great.

#### 10\. Fireworks

This one is just a lot of fun. Fireworks, in 4K. Color rendition, detail, it has it all. It opens with a magnificent view across the city showing the lights at dusk and beyond, and then into the stunning firework display, it really is quite spectacular and a great look at 4K footage.

That’s our top 10, not all the best technically, but each offers something a little different to give a taste of what 4K is all about, and exactly what your 4K screen is capable of.

There are multiple 4K video converters with powerful functions.

And guess what? Since it comes within the system, all the features, although limited, are absolutely free.

### How to Merge Videos on Windows using Photos App?

## Choosing the best video trimmer for you; desktop or online?

Choosing an online or desktop video trimmer is a decision only you, as a professional, can make. Still, the truth is desktop trimmers work more efficiently than online solutions for a good number of reasons.

Accuracy: Though online video trimmers might look a bit faster than desktop options, it might not give the flexibility to make changes at will like the desktop options.

Efficiency: If you enjoy working without an internet connection, or have issues with a reception where you reside, then the online video trimmers are not for you.

Space: However, online versions are best suited for people using PCs with low storage space and saving space and time. However, if you want to edit generally and not just trim videos alone, most desktop options come with other editing features than trim.

Speed: Also, because you do not have to wait for an internet signal, desktop video trimmers render faster than online video trimmers (though still depending on system speed).

Verdict: It will be best to try desktop video trimmers for major projects. Online solutions are online cool while either doing a test project or for personal use.

## Conclusion

● The fact remains that the efficiency of your editing software or tool has a huge influence on your productivity. And even though choosing the best video trimmer for your next project might seem dicey, following a simple review like this will make it easy to select from the best and try to know what works best for you.

Generally, for the same price, you will be able to get a better build quality, longger battery life and lighter Chromebook, compared to Mac and PC. However, it is a common knowledge that Chromebooks don't support Windows or Mac video applications or any other apps that aren't designed for the Chrome OS. But, if you are looking for a way to edit your videos from a Chromebook do not despair because there is a way to use Windows or Mac software. Instead of being forced to use online editors that often provide just a few basic editing options Chromebook users can access editing software that is compatible with Mac or Windows OS. There is more than just one way to gain access to Mac and Windows programs, although before getting your hopes up, you should first check if the Chromebook model you have allows you to install the necessary software.

These solutions may not be obvious, but using them may enable you to use professional editing software that is available for Mac and Windows operating systems. Let's see how you can run Filmora, Final Cut Pro, Sony Vegas Pro or any other powerful video editing software from your Chromebook.

## Part 1: How to Run Windows and Mac OS Video Editing Apps on Chromebook

As we already mentioned there are two different ways to run Mac and Windows OS video editing apps from your Chromebook, although one method is much less complicated than the other. Let's have a look at the methods that will enable you to gain access to all applications you need to create stunning videos.

#### Method 1: Accessing with Chromebook Desktop Remote

A simple app that is available at the Google Play Store for free will enable you to access a remote computer and use any programs installed on it from your Chromebook. There are many applications similar to Chrome Desktop Remote, but we chose it because it is simple to use, very effective and completely free.

#### 1.Install Chromebook Desktop Remote

The first step is to install the Chrome Desktop Remote app on both the computers you want to pair with and your Chromebook. After the application is installed, you will be presented with two options in the app's main screen Remote Assistance and My Computers.

![chromebook-remote-desktop](https://images.wondershare.com/filmora/article-images/chromebook-remote-desktop.jpg)

Choose the My Computers option, then click on Get Started button and select the Enable Remote Connections feature. Once you've completed these actions, accept to install the Chrome Desktop Remote Host Installer and after the installation is over, run the installer.

#### 2.Choose PIN

In the next step, you will be asked to select the security PIN for the host computer, that must be numeric and that has at least six digits. After you successfully completed this task the part of the process related to the host computer is finished, although you may want to adjust power saving settings so it doesn't go into a standby mode if it is inactive for too long.

![chromebook-pin](https://images.wondershare.com/filmora/article-images/chromebook-pin.jpg)

#### 3.Make Connection

In order to establish the connection between your PC and your Chromebook, both devices must sign into the same Google account. Go to the Google Play Store, only this time from you Chromebook and click on the Launch app option, the app should already be installed on the Chromebook you are using as a consequence of Google accounts keeping in sync. After you launched the app go to My Computers option and choose the Get Started feature. Select the computer you'd like to connect to and insert the PIN. After you entered the PIN, click on the Connect option and you should be able to see the desktop of your computer in the web browser.

![chromebook-connection](https://images.wondershare.com/filmora/article-images/chromebook-connection.jpg)

#### 4.Optimize Options

Due to disparities between screen resolutions, pictures you will be able to see on your Chromebook may appear to be a little grainy. If you'd like to have a sharper and clearer image go to Options and disable Shrink to Fit feature. Furthermore, users who'd like to use video editing apps must make sure that all content they would like to edit is either on the Googe Drive because the Chrome Desktop Remote doesn't offer a direct transfer of files as an option.

#### Method 2: Using Developer Mode and Installing a Virtual Machine

The second method is best suited for Chromebook owners who are already running a Linux OS on their devices. The Developer Mode can provide a powerful Linux desktop on Chrombook, although it is a slightly complicated process that can be time-consuming. Before install a Virtual Machine software on Chromebook, you should check if your Chromebook is ARM or Intel based, because Virtual Machine software can't run on ARM powered Chromebooks.

* The first step of the process is to install the Linux OS from the Developer Mode on your Chromebook, then switch to the newly installed OS and start the installation of the Virtual Machine software like Virtual Box or Windows Virtual PC.
* The next step is to install the Windows OS inside the Virtual Box or any other Virtual Machine software you decided to use. This will enable you to switch between Chrome OS and Linux OS with a simple keyboard shortcut or use editing software that is compatible with the Windows OS.

![chromebook-virtual-machine](https://images.wondershare.com/filmora/article-images/chromebook-virtual-machine.jpg)

* After you've successfully installed the Windows OS within the Virtual Machine software you can install video editing software that will allow you to edit videos from your Chromebook. The Virtual Machine software takes a lot of hard-drive space so that may not leave too much space for the video footage you'd like to edit with your Chromebook. Even the latest Chromebooks offer barely enough processing power required to run more demanding editing software, so using the software like the Virtual Box may limit their performance even more.

Chromebook owners who would like to have access to Mac and Windows video editing apps will benefit more if they choose to install the Chromebook Desktop Remote application because it is easier to use and it has performed much better than all other methods of accessing software designed for Mac, Windows or Linux operating systems.

Bonus: We highly recommend you to use our Filmora X following the instructions above, we optimized the app for it.

Even the latest Chromebooks offer barely enough processing power required to run more demanding editing software, so using the software like the Virtual Box may limit their performance even more.

Chromebook owners who would like to have access to Mac and Windows video editing apps will benefit more if they choose to install the Chromebook Desktop Remote application because it is easier to use and it has performed much better than all other methods of accessing software designed for Mac, Windows or Linux operating systems.

Bonus: We highly recommend you to use our Filmora X following the instructions above, we optimized the app for it.

Generally, for the same price, you will be able to get a better build quality, longger battery life and lighter Chromebook, compared to Mac and PC. However, it is a common knowledge that Chromebooks don't support Windows or Mac video applications or any other apps that aren't designed for the Chrome OS. But, if you are looking for a way to edit your videos from a Chromebook do not despair because there is a way to use Windows or Mac software. Instead of being forced to use online editors that often provide just a few basic editing options Chromebook users can access editing software that is compatible with Mac or Windows OS. There is more than just one way to gain access to Mac and Windows programs, although before getting your hopes up, you should first check if the Chromebook model you have allows you to install the necessary software.

These solutions may not be obvious, but using them may enable you to use professional editing software that is available for Mac and Windows operating systems. Let's see how you can run Filmora, Final Cut Pro, Sony Vegas Pro or any other powerful video editing software from your Chromebook.

## Part 1: How to Run Windows and Mac OS Video Editing Apps on Chromebook

As we already mentioned there are two different ways to run Mac and Windows OS video editing apps from your Chromebook, although one method is much less complicated than the other. Let's have a look at the methods that will enable you to gain access to all applications you need to create stunning videos.

#### Method 1: Accessing with Chromebook Desktop Remote

A simple app that is available at the Google Play Store for free will enable you to access a remote computer and use any programs installed on it from your Chromebook. There are many applications similar to Chrome Desktop Remote, but we chose it because it is simple to use, very effective and completely free.

#### 1.Install Chromebook Desktop Remote

The first step is to install the Chrome Desktop Remote app on both the computers you want to pair with and your Chromebook. After the application is installed, you will be presented with two options in the app's main screen Remote Assistance and My Computers.

Choose the My Computers option, then click on Get Started button and select the Enable Remote Connections feature. Once you've completed these actions, accept to install the Chrome Desktop Remote Host Installer and after the installation is over, run the installer.

#### 2.Choose PIN

In the next step, you will be asked to select the security PIN for the host computer, that must be numeric and that has at least six digits. After you successfully completed this task the part of the process related to the host computer is finished, although you may want to adjust power saving settings so it doesn't go into a standby mode if it is inactive for too long.

#### 3.Make Connection

In order to establish the connection between your PC and your Chromebook, both devices must sign into the same Google account. Go to the Google Play Store, only this time from you Chromebook and click on the Launch app option, the app should already be installed on the Chromebook you are using as a consequence of Google accounts keeping in sync. After you launched the app go to My Computers option and choose the Get Started feature. Select the computer you'd like to connect to and insert the PIN. After you entered the PIN, click on the Connect option and you should be able to see the desktop of your computer in the web browser.

#### 4.Optimize Options

Due to disparities between screen resolutions, pictures you will be able to see on your Chromebook may appear to be a little grainy. If you'd like to have a sharper and clearer image go to Options and disable Shrink to Fit feature. Furthermore, users who'd like to use video editing apps must make sure that all content they would like to edit is either on the Googe Drive because the Chrome Desktop Remote doesn't offer a direct transfer of files as an option.

#### Method 2: Using Developer Mode and Installing a Virtual Machine

The second method is best suited for Chromebook owners who are already running a Linux OS on their devices. The Developer Mode can provide a powerful Linux desktop on Chrombook, although it is a slightly complicated process that can be time-consuming. Before install a Virtual Machine software on Chromebook, you should check if your Chromebook is ARM or Intel based, because Virtual Machine software can't run on ARM powered Chromebooks.

* The first step of the process is to install the Linux OS from the Developer Mode on your Chromebook, then switch to the newly installed OS and start the installation of the Virtual Machine software like Virtual Box or Windows Virtual PC.
* The next step is to install the Windows OS inside the Virtual Box or any other Virtual Machine software you decided to use. This will enable you to switch between Chrome OS and Linux OS with a simple keyboard shortcut or use editing software that is compatible with the Windows OS.

* After you've successfully installed the Windows OS within the Virtual Machine software you can install video editing software that will allow you to edit videos from your Chromebook. The Virtual Machine software takes a lot of hard-drive space so that may not leave too much space for the video footage you'd like to edit with your Chromebook.
