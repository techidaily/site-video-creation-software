## Part 2: What is Video Tag, and why should you use it?

The <video> tag lets you insert video content or a media player in a document, for example, to embed a movie clip or other different video streams. The video tag includes one or more <source> tags with various video sources, and the browser will select the source it supports.

Do you know why to use these tags? The video tags are illustrative keywords that can add to the video to help viewers search the content. Further, video tags are contemplated as an important ranking factor in algorithm and YouTube's search. Most importantly, video tags give information about your video to Google search and YouTube, such as your video's category, topic, note boundaries, and more. Further, video tags allow you to arrange and manage files easily, plus sort and search the target video file promptly.
