## Fix Apple Music Web Player not Playing on Windows & macOS Browser

With Apple ID and Apple Music account signed in, the full length singles like Humility by Gorillaz can be easily tuned in instead of a preview 20s version. However, when I try clicking a playlist under the "New Music Playlists" for listening to Songs of the Summer in loops, there's no playlists interface coming out.
