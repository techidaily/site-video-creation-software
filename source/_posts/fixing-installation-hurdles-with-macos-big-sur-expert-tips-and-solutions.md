_"an error occurred while installing this update" while upgrading Big Sur on MacBook Pro Early 2015\. – asked by S Sayeed_

_Unable to download macOS Big Sur. – asked by alexcriq_

_I have errors during installation and the update to SUR is blocked. – aksed by JBCROSSUSA_

If you are trying to update your macOS Catalina or Mojave Mac to macOS Big Sur but just fail, you are not alone to get the error notification. When macOS Big Sur is available to download, the most mentioned words are "**Installation Failed. An error occurred while installing the selected update**". I have to say, the bad comments flood. After ransacking the Apple Community, I have found that nearly all types of Macs have the problem of updating to macOS Big Sur, including Machintosh HD, 2010 MacBook Pro, MacBook Pro Early 2015, 2018 MacBook Pro, MacBook 2017, MacBook Air, MacBook Pro 16, iMac 2020, and 2020 Intel Mac mini. Besides the installation failed issue, "Update not found" and "[Mac apps not opening](https://tools.techidaily.com/5kplayer/airplay/)" are also other big problems.

As always, including macOS, iOS, iPadOS, every new update needs time to be stable and workable. macOS Big Sur update not working problem is no exception, and is also not surprising. But the solution is necessary when any problem occurs.

However, it seems that doesn’t end the complaints. Many users still report the Big Sur install trouble in Apple discussion community.

So, to help you get rid of the headache error notifications, below are some possible solutions. Hope they are helpful.

According to Apple, macOS Big Sur can be downloaded on MacBook (from 2015 and later), MacBook Air (from 2013 and later), MacBook Pro (from late 2013), iMac Pro (from 2014 and later), iMac Pro (from 2017 and later), Mac mini (from 2014 and later), Mac Pro (from 2013 and later).

The macOS Big Sur update is only about 12GB in size. However, someone said that you need to have at least 35.5GB of disk space free. After all, another user had reported that his Big Sur download stuck at 12.18GB.

**Method 3\. Wait a day or two before installing macOS Big Sur**
