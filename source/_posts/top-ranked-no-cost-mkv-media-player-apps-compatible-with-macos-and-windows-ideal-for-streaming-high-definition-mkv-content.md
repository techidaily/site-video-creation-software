## Comparing the Main Qualities of Best 3 MKV Players

When it comes to MKV player, VLC or MPlayerX will jump into the recommendation, those MKV players are undoubtedly the best two MKV players you would choose. However, 5KPlayer now is also a professional [free MKV video player](https://tools.techidaily.com/5kplayer/video-music-player/) which is widely recognized due to its cutting edge advantage of better playing full HD and ultra HD MKV files than MPlayerX and VLC. Now, let's compare them in three different aspects for your reference.

**Best MKV Players – Main Interface**

Like VLC, 5KPlayer does have a straightforward main interface but MPlayerX does not. MPlayerX strives for simple interface, but it overlooked that some users would prefer a manageable window of control than staring at a playing window and monkeying with every button. But compared to VLC whose interface is too complicated, the style of 5KPlayer is more attractive and user-friendly. It lists every function with the related icon: Play music, video, listen to online radio, and download videos from online video sites, and stream media with the function of [AirPlay](https://tools.techidaily.com/5kplayer/airplay/).

**Best MKV Players – Playback Settings**

Compared to 5KPlayer, MPlayerX doesn't have a playlist, saying the playlist is unnecessary if it can go straight to the next episode or next video as long as they are in the same folder. But for some users who got used to checking the play history and jumping between chapters should want that list to look through and 5KPlayer can be the best MKV player that is available to choose chapter when playing.  
 Like MPlayerX and VLC, 5Kplayer can also switch the subtitle track and audio track, and you can set it right on the interface and in the "preference" outside of the playback window. And more interesting, it supports rotating the MKV video right to left, left to right and upside down.
