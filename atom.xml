The Video Board can be opened by using three different ways:</p><ul><li>You can select audio enhancement and color correction options available below the viewer and then hit “Show Color Board”. It can be simply done by pressing <strong>CMD + 6</strong>.</li></ul><p><img                       lazyload                     src="/images/loading.svg"                     data-src="https://images.wondershare.com/filmora/article-images/color-correction-in-fcp-1.png"                      alt="Show Color Board”."                ></p><ul><li>On effect browser you can easily access color correction effects inside the color category; that is also easier to allocate.</li></ul><p><img                       lazyload                     src="/images/loading.svg"                     data-src="https://images.wondershare.com/filmora/article-images/color-correction-in-fcp-2.png"                      alt="Effect Browser"                ></p><ul><li>Choose <strong>Window</strong> and then click on <strong>Go To</strong>, you will find <strong>Color Board</strong> on the appeared drop-down menu.</li></ul><p><img                       lazyload                     src="/images/loading.svg"                     data-src="https://images.wondershare.com/filmora/article-images/color-correction-in-fcp-3.png"                      alt="Go to Color Board"                ></p><ul><li>All the color correction effects will start appearing in the effects section available on the video inspector.</li></ul><p><img                       lazyload                     src="/images/loading.svg"                     data-src="https://images.wondershare.com/filmora/article-images/color-correction-in-fcp-4.png"                      alt="Color correction effects on video inspector."                ></p><h4 id="Step-2"><a href="#Step-2" class="headerlink" title="Step 2"></a>Step 2</h4><p>As soon as you start working on <strong>Color Board</strong>, it is good to open Video Scopes on your system. For this you need to click on a small icon of light switch available at the top right corner of the viewer and then select Show Video Scopes from drop-down menu. It can be also done by simply pressing Command+7.</p><p><img                       lazyload                     src="/images/loading.svg"                     data-src="https://images.wondershare.com/filmora/article-images/color-correction-in-fcp-5.png"                      alt="select Show Video Scopes from drop down menu."                ></p><p>As soon as you make this selection, the video scopes window will automatically appear on the next viewer. Here users can easily obtain information related to the current video frame, and they can be easily configured as per need. Go to the settings option available on the top right side of the window and then hit the <strong>Waveform</strong> option.</p><p><img                       lazyload                     src="/images/loading.svg"                     data-src="https://images.wondershare.com/filmora/article-images/color-correction-in-fcp-6.png"                      alt="Go to settings option available at top right side of window and then hit Waveform option."                ></p><h4 id="Step-3"><a href="#Step-3" class="headerlink" title="Step 3"></a>Step 3</h4><p>Now it is time to work on color correction directly. There are three types of color corrections that users need to work upon: Hue, Saturation, and Exposure. Here is some brief information about all of these:</p><p><strong>Exposure or Brightness:</strong> On the Color board window you can easily make adjustments for brightness levels of video clips. As you move on to different portions of the image ranging between dark and white parts, the scope will keep on displaying waveforms with values between 0 and 100 representing darkness and brightness respectively. The master slider available on screen helps users to make overall adjustments for brightness by using three control options: highlights for white circles, midtones for gray scale and shadows for black parts. Consider waveform values as a guide for adjustment and move controls up and down to adjust contrast as per need.</p><p><img                       lazyload                     src="/images/loading.svg"                     data-src="https://images.wondershare.com/filmora/article-images/color-correction-in-fcp-7.png"                      alt="Exposure or Brightness"                ></p><p><strong>Saturation:</strong> It refers to the richness of colors in an image. Simply select saturation pane from the color board and on the video scopes window you can use the settings menu directly to adjust saturation information for every pixel. The image pixels that are far away from the center of vectorscope circle means they are more saturated as compared to pixels that are little bit closure.</p><p><img                       lazyload                     src="/images/loading.svg"                     data-src="https://images.wondershare.com/filmora/article-images/color-correction-in-fcp-8.png"                      alt="Saturation"                ></p><p><strong>Hue:</strong>  Hue displays the actual color values in images or frames in terms of primary colors: red, blue, and yellow. Use color pane from color board to adjust hue that is displayed in the form of a rainbow on screen. It is possible to manipulate values for highlights, midtones and shadows individually as per need.

This dedicated software offers its users numerous different features that are aimed at making your video content better. It is widely loved by users for its prestigious and easy-to-use features.</p><p>However, much to many people’s dismay, Filmora is not free. But would you like to acquire the <strong>Filmora free</strong> version on your device? Would you like to download the Wondershare Filmora video editor for free and edit videos or photos without paying $49.99 annually? If so, here are some solutions to getting Filmora video editors completely free without violating the law.</p><ul><li><a href="#part1">Part 1: Getting Filmora Full Version for Free via Taking Mission</a></li><li><a href="#part2">Part 2: Most Easy and Creative Features in Filmora (You Should Definitely Try)</a></li></ul><h2 id="Part-1-Getting-Filmora-for-Free-via-Taking-the-Mission-to-Export-3-Videos"><a href="#Part-1-Getting-Filmora-for-Free-via-Taking-the-Mission-to-Export-3-Videos" class="headerlink" title="Part 1: Getting Filmora for Free via Taking the Mission to Export 3 Videos"></a>Part 1: Getting Filmora for Free via Taking the Mission to Export 3 Videos</h2><p>Another method is for users who have already installed Filmora on their devices.

The method is quite simple and easy, but the mission is only available for Filmora 10.2 and above versions for a limited time. And the mission may be taken down sometime.</p><p>In order to do so, you have to follow the steps mentioned below.</p><p><a href="https://tools.techidaily.com/wondershare/filmora/download/"><img                       lazyload                     src="/images/loading.svg"                     data-src="https://images.wondershare.com/filmora/guide/download-btn-win.jpg"                      alt="Download Filmora X Win Version"                > </a> <a href="https://tools.techidaily.com/wondershare/filmora/download/"><img                       lazyload                     src="/images/loading.svg"                     data-src="https://images.wondershare.com/filmora/guide/download-btn-mac.jpg"                      alt="Download Filmora X Mac Version"                > </a></p><ul><li>To begin with, you need to download and install Filmora, and then launch Filmora and then click New Project to create a new project.

Capturing unique materials that were never seen by the world before has become the question of prestige among the filmmakers. Nonetheless, certain genres of film are almost entirely dependent on the public domain footage. Documentaries about historic events, space or any other topic that is impossible to stage rely on the videos that entered the public domain for one reason or the other. That’s why in this article, we are going to take you through some of the best websites that let you download public domain videos.</p><h2 id="What-is-Public-Domain-Video"><a href="#What-is-Public-Domain-Video" class="headerlink" title="What is Public Domain Video?"></a>What is Public Domain Video?</h2><p>Any video that is not subject to copyright can be considered a public domain video. This means that anyone can use this footage for free without having to ask for permission to do so. Videos can enter the public domain under the following circumstances:</p><ul><li>If the footage was produced by a government because governments are obligated by the law to offer the footage to the public domain.</li><li>In case the author of the footage has forfeited his or her copyrights and dedicated the footage to the public domain</li><li>A film or any other work of art becomes public domain 70 years after the death of the copyright holder. The expiration date of the copyrights is not the same in all the countries around the world, which is why you must make sure that the video you want to use is, in fact, a public domain video.</li></ul><p>In addition, you should avoid using the footage that contains art or music that can be described as third-party intellectual property because you may unintentionally infringe copyrights.</p><h2 id="Best-Online-Websites-Where-You-Can-Download-Public-Domain-Videos"><a href="#Best-Online-Websites-Where-You-Can-Download-Public-Domain-Videos" class="headerlink" title="Best Online Websites Where You Can Download Public Domain Videos"></a>Best Online Websites Where You Can Download Public Domain Videos</h2><p><strong>Finding free public domain footage or public movies</strong> on the Internet has never been too difficult, as you can watch thousands of public domain movies on YouTube, but you cannot download them. Over the course of the last couple of decades, the websites where you can <strong>download public domain footage</strong> have grown in number, which makes it somewhat easier to find the video clips you can use in your projects for free. Here are some of the best online destinations where you can <strong>download public domain videos</strong>.</p><h4 id="1-Prelinger-Archive"><a href="#1-Prelinger-Archive" class="headerlink" title="1. Prelinger Archive"></a>1. Prelinger Archive</h4><p><img                       lazyload                     src="/images/loading.svg"                     data-src="https://images.wondershare.com/filmora/article-images/prelinger-achives-public-domain-video-collection.jpg"                      alt="Public Domain Video Download"                ></p><p>With more than 17,000 items in the collection, the Prelinger Archive is probably one of the largest public domain video libraries on the Internet. The archive was founded in 1983 by Rick Prelinger, but by 2002 it became a part of the Library of Congress Motion Picture Broadcasting and Recorded Sound Divison’s collection. You can <strong>download public domain video clips</strong> created by educational institutions, advertising companies, trade associations or corporations from this impressive collection. There are different download options available for each file, so you can choose the size of a file and the method you’re going to use to download a file to your computer.</p><h4 id="2-The-Public-Domain-Review"><a href="#2-The-Public-Domain-Review" class="headerlink" title="2. The Public Domain Review"></a>2. The Public Domain Review</h4><p><img                       lazyload                     src="/images/loading.svg"                     data-src="https://images.wondershare.com/filmora/article-images/public-domain-review-film-collection.jpg"                      alt="Public Domain Video Collections"                ></p><p>This is an excellent resource for researchers looking for essays, books, audio recordings, images or old films. The movies are divided into different categories such as Animals&amp;Beasts, Politics, War or Sports which makes locating and <strong>downloading public domain videos</strong> faster and easier. The Public Domain Review offers footage that is available within different public domain licenses, so you must make sure that the film you want to download can be used for the purpose you have in mind. The vast majority of the films in this archive are from the last decade of the 19th and the first half of the 20th century. That’s why The Public Domain Review’s selection of films can only be useful if you are researching a topic from that era.</p><h4 id="3-The-National-Screening-Room"><a href="#3-The-National-Screening-Room" class="headerlink" title="3. The National Screening Room"></a>3. The National Screening Room</h4><p><img                       lazyload                     src="/images/loading.svg"                     data-src="https://images.wondershare.com/filmora/article-images/national-screening-room-collection-videos.jpg"                      alt="National Screening Room Public Domain Video Collection"                ></p><p>The National Screening Room is a project created by the Library of Congress National Audio-Visual Conservation Center with the aim of making the videos from their collection available to the viewers around the world. The vast majority of the videos in the collection were filmed during the 20th century, but there are only a few videos available that are produced outside of the United States. The National Screening Room can be a valuable asset if you are looking for videos you can use for educational or research videos that cover topics that range from the development of the arms industry to the daily life of great American inventors.</p><h4 id="4-Pond5’s-Public-Domain-Project"><a href="#4-Pond5’s-Public-Domain-Project" class="headerlink" title="4. Pond5’s Public Domain Project"></a>4. Pond5’s Public Domain Project</h4><p><img                       lazyload                     src="/images/loading.svg"                     data-src="https://images.wondershare.com/filmora/article-images/pond5-free-public-domain-collection.jpg"                      alt="Pond 5 Public Domain Video Download"                ></p><p>Industry professionals don’t need an introduction to the Pond5 platform, because it is probably the largest online marketplace for royalty-free media at the moment. Their Public Domain Project contains a thousand public videos that can be downloaded for free, but the duration of these videos is limited to just two minutes To make things worse, most of these public domain videos don’t have audio, so you can only use them if you already have a soundtrack for the video you’re making. The platform offers powerful search tools that enable you to look for videos based on different parameters. You can download public domain videos in HD resolution, but you must create an account on Pond5 before you can save them to your computer.</p><h4 id="5-Pexels"><a href="#5-Pexels" class="headerlink" title="5. Pexels"></a>5. Pexels</h4><p><img                       lazyload                     src="/images/loading.svg"                     data-src="https://images.wondershare.com/filmora/article-images/public-domain-videos-from-pexels.jpg"                      alt="Pexels Public Domain Video  Collection"                ></p><p><strong>Free public domain stock footage</strong> can be used on different types of projects, and it is usually a great choice if you’re looking for some extra shots that will make a scene in your video more cinematic. Pexels offers an impressive collection of free public domain stock videos, so you just have to insert a search term and pick a video clip that best fits your needs. The duration of the free videos you can find on Pexels rarely exceeds thirty seconds, which makes it difficult to make an entire video exclusively from free public domain stock footage. Hence it is better to use Pexels as a complementary source of shots in case you can’t go back to the filming location.</p><h4 id="6-Vidsplay"><a href="#6-Vidsplay" class="headerlink" title="6. Vidsplay"></a>6. Vidsplay</h4><p>All video clips you can find on this platform are free, so you just have to select one of the categories and start browsing through the available public domain stock footage. The only condition to use the stock footage on private or commercial projects for free is to credit the Vidsplay platform in the end credits, on the website or in the description of the videos you upload to your social media channels. All stock videos on Vidsplay are available in HD or 4K resolution, and you simply have to click on the Download button below a particular video to save it.</p><h4 id="7-The-Moving-Image-Archive"><a href="#7-The-Moving-Image-Archive" class="headerlink" title="7. The Moving Image Archive"></a>7. The Moving Image Archive</h4><p>This is yet another archive of public domain videos you can find on the <a class="link"   href="https://archive.org/" >Arhive.org <i class="fa-regular fa-arrow-up-right-from-square fa-sm"></i></a> that features countless collections of texts, images, and videos. Within the Moving Image Archive, you can find different collections that contain full feature movies, art videos, animations, cartoons or television footage. The public domain videos hosted on The Moving Image Archive cover a broad range of topics, but some of them can be in poor resolution. The Moving Image Archive can be an excellent source of footage for anyone who wants to download <strong>public domain video clips</strong> and use them in their commercial or non-commercial projects.</p><h4 id="8-PublicDomainFootage"><a href="#8-PublicDomainFootage" class="headerlink" title="8. PublicDomainFootage"></a>8. PublicDomainFootage</h4><p>BBC, National Geographics or NBC are just a few among many famous television networks that use the services of PublicDomainFootage. All content on the platform is divided into Archival Footage and Historic Newsreels sections that contain categories like Atomic Age, Civil Rights or Pop Culture. You can also use PublicDomainFootage to research a particular topic and request content that is not uploaded to the website. You can <strong>download a public domain video</strong> after you pay a one time fee that enables you to use that video as many times as you want. The platform’s YouTube channel provides an easy way of searching for public domain videos you are going to use in your next documentary film.</p><h4 id="9-NASA’s-Video-Gallery"><a href="#9-NASA’s-Video-Gallery" class="headerlink" title="9. NASA’s Video Gallery"></a>9. NASA’s Video Gallery</h4><p>Space exploration is undoubtedly one of the hottest topics of our era, so if you are looking for some space public domain videos NASA’s website is the best place to start. Like all other government institutions, NASA is obligated by the law to offer all images and videos to the public domain. This means that all content you download from their website is free to use. Simply insert the search term and browse the results until you find the video clip you want to save to your computer. However, most public domain videos you can download from NASA’s website last only a couple of minutes.</p><h4 id="10-Motion-Elements"><a href="#10-Motion-Elements" class="headerlink" title="10. Motion Elements"></a>10. Motion Elements</h4><p>The collection of <strong>free public domain stock footage,</strong> this website offers contains more than 4,000 clips. Categories like Cityscape, Animals or Water contain hundreds of stock videos, so you just have to open one of the available categories and locate the video clip you want to download. However, you must first create an account on Motion Elements before you can save video files to your computer. In addition, the platform doesn’t allow you to make more than five downloads per week and you must invite your friends to join the platform if you want to increase the weekly number of downloads. Even so, Motion Elements is a great source of stock footage you can use without any restrictions.</p><h2 id="Is-It-Okay-to-Use-Public-Domain-Videos-for-Commercial-Purposes"><a href="#Is-It-Okay-to-Use-Public-Domain-Videos-for-Commercial-Purposes" class="headerlink" title="Is It Okay to Use Public Domain Videos for Commercial Purposes?"></a>Is It Okay to Use Public Domain Videos for Commercial Purposes?</h2><p>All public domain videos can be used for both commercial and non-commercial projects, but you must approach using public domain videos for commercial purposes with caution. Crediting the author or providing the source from which you acquired the footage will reduce the likelihood of legal complications. The public domain videos that feature famous actors or third party intellectual property can also be a subject of legal disputes, which is why it is better to avoid using them on commercial projects.</p><h2 id="What-Should-You-Do-If-You-Can’t-Find-Public-Domain-Footage-for-Your-Project"><a href="#What-Should-You-Do-If-You-Can’t-Find-Public-Domain-Footage-for-Your-Project" class="headerlink" title="What Should You Do If You Can’t Find Public Domain Footage for Your Project?"></a>What Should You Do If You Can’t Find Public Domain Footage for Your Project?</h2><p>Opting for videos that are protected by the <a class="link"   href="https://creativecommons.org/licenses/" >Creative Commons licenses <i class="fa-regular fa-arrow-up-right-from-square fa-sm"></i></a> is probably the safest option if you’re struggling to find the public domain footage you’d like to use in your project. Respecting the terms of the license under which a video is protected is of utmost importance, since failing to properly credit the author of the video, for instance, can have legal consequences. There are several different types of Creative Commons licenses and you must find out which one covers the video you’d like to use, before publishing your video. You can find more information about Creative Commons licenses at the <a class="link"   href="https://creativecommons.org/faq/" >FAQ <i class="fa-regular fa-arrow-up-right-from-square fa-sm"></i></a>.</p><p><strong>Conclusion</strong></p><p>Public domain videos cover very different topics, which means that the nature of your project determines the source from which you’ll acquire the footage. If you are researching the early days of cinema, then you’ll have no trouble downloading the public domain videos, but if the topic you’re exploring is more contemporary, finding the content you can use without any restrictions can prove to be troublesome.

Surely, you’re missing great fun if you’re a video professional or a beginner video editor.</p><p>Filmora is an award-winning video editing software that works for both PC and MAC users. While the tool comes at an affordable price, you can still download the free setup to start showing your creativity.</p><p>This video editor has dozens of new effects, transitions, and many more features, which can help you create engaging videos. You can also enjoy some more key features, including audio ducking, color matching, motion tracking, split screen, video filters and transitions, speed control, and multiple exporting formats.</p><p>And, of course, video rotation is as easy as ABC! You can follow this step-by-step tutorial to rotate or flip your videos using Filmora 10. You can apply the same procedure if you have a different version.</p><p><strong>Step 1: Download and Install Filmora</strong></p><p>Visit Filmora Video Editor’s <a class="link"   href="https://tools.techidaily.com/wondershare/filmora/download/" >official website <i class="fa-regular fa-arrow-up-right-from-square fa-sm"></i></a> to download the newest version. Click on the “Try it Free” button according to your operating system (look at the icons on the button to identify the OS).</p><p><img                       lazyload                     src="/images/loading.svg"                     data-src="https://images.wondershare.com/filmora/article-images/2022/07/avi-video-rotators-1.jpg"                      alt="avi video rotators"                ></p><p>After downloading the setup, double-click the file to install the video editor. Then, open the program.</p><p>Feel free to judge the interface (see the image below), as it is pretty simple to understand. So, even if you’re a beginner, you can learn this tool within a few minutes of practice.</p><p><img                       lazyload                     src="/images/loading.svg"                     data-src="https://images.wondershare.com/filmora/article-images/2022/07/avi-video-rotators-2.jpg"                      alt="avi video rotators"                ></p><p><strong>Step 2: Import the Video You Want to Rotate</strong></p><p>The next is to bring the video file to Filmora’s library before proceeding. To do that, click on the “Movie Clip” icon in the center of the interface to select the clip from your computer’s hard drive.</p><p><img                       lazyload                     src="/images/loading.svg"                     data-src="https://images.wondershare.com/filmora/article-images/2022/07/avi-video-rotators-3.jpg"                      alt="avi video rotators"                ></p><p>Double-click or select the video and click the “Open” button to import files. The importing process may take several seconds or a few minutes, depending on the video size.</p><p><img                       lazyload                     src="/images/loading.svg"                     data-src="https://images.wondershare.com/filmora/article-images/2022/07/avi-video-rotators-4.jpg"                      alt="avi video rotators"                ></p><p>If you’re using Filmora for the first time, you might see the “Create Proxy File” message popping up right after the video import. So, simply click on the “Yes” button to go ahead.</p><p><img                       lazyload                     src="/images/loading.svg"                     data-src="https://images.wondershare.com/filmora/article-images/2022/07/avi-video-rotators-5.jpg"                      alt="avi video rotators"                ></p><p>Your video will be stored in the “Project Media” tab and will be visible next to the preview window.</p><p><img                       lazyload                     src="/images/loading.svg"                     data-src="https://images.wondershare.com/filmora/article-images/2022/07/avi-video-rotators-6.jpg"                      alt="avi video rotators"                ></p><p><strong>Step 3: Drag and Drop the Video on Filmora’s Timeline</strong></p><p>To rotate the video, first, you need to add it to the track. For that, take your mouse on the video, and select it by clicking the right button on your mouse. Keep holding the button to drag the video on the timeline. Remove your finger from the button after placing the clip on the track.</p><p><img                       lazyload                     src="/images/loading.svg"                     data-src="https://images.wondershare.com/filmora/article-images/2022/07/avi-video-rotators-7.jpg"                      alt="avi video rotators"                ></p><p>Right after the above step, you will get another message to help you decide whether you want to keep the resolution of the video to its original settings or match the media. Choose “Match to Media” for fast rendering.</p><p><img                       lazyload                     src="/images/loading.svg"                     data-src="https://images.wondershare.com/filmora/article-images/2022/07/avi-video-rotators-8.jpg"                      alt="avi video rotators"                ></p><p>However, if you’re a professional video editor, feel free to select the option that suits you the most.</p><p><strong>Step 4: Rotate Your Video with Filmora</strong></p><p>Double-click anywhere on the video that is already on the timeline.</p><p><img                       lazyload                     src="/images/loading.svg"                     data-src="https://images.wondershare.com/filmora/article-images/2022/07/avi-video-rotators-9.jpg"                      alt="avi video rotators"                ></p><p>You will see three tabs – “Video,” “Color,” and “Animation.” So choose the “Video” tab and click on the “Transform” option.</p><p><img                       lazyload                     src="/images/loading.svg"                     data-src="https://images.wondershare.com/filmora/article-images/2022/07/avi-video-rotators-10.jpg"                      alt="avi video rotators"                ></p><p>Once done, you will see three important options, which will help you rotate the video.</p><p>First, you will notice the “Rotate” option with an adjustment bar. This option will turn your video to different angles of your choice.</p><p>All you need to do is play with the adjustments by grabbing the “Round” knob-like button while keeping an eye on the preview window to see the results.</p><p><img                       lazyload                     src="/images/loading.svg"                     data-src="https://images.wondershare.com/filmora/article-images/2022/07/avi-video-rotators-11.jpg"                      alt="avi video rotators"                ></p><p>Just below “Rotate,” you will see the “Flip” option with “Horizontal” and “Vertical” mirror icons. Choosing any one of the icons will make your video mirror flip in horizontal or vertical directions.</p><p><img                       lazyload                     src="/images/loading.svg"                     data-src="https://images.wondershare.com/filmora/article-images/2022/07/avi-video-rotators-12.jpg"                      alt="avi video rotators"                ></p><p>The third option is “Scale” beneath the “Flip” option. Similar to the rotate option, this tool also has an adjustment bar. You can make adjustments to magnify or de-magnify the clip to fit the screen. Although this option isn’t mandatory, you can still use it if you find the need.</p><p><img                       lazyload                     src="/images/loading.svg"                     data-src="https://images.wondershare.com/filmora/article-images/2022/07/avi-video-rotators-13.jpg"                      alt="avi video rotators"                ></p><p><img                       lazyload                     src="/images/loading.svg"                     data-src="https://images.wondershare.com/filmora/article-images/2022/07/avi-video-rotators-14.jpg"                      alt="avi video rotators"                ></p><p>Now, click the “OK” button to apply rotation and return to the timeline.</p><p><img                       lazyload                     src="/images/loading.svg"                     data-src="https://images.wondershare.com/filmora/article-images/2022/07/avi-video-rotators-15.jpg"                      alt="avi video rotators"                ></p><p><strong>Step 5: Save and Export Rotated Video to Your Widows or MAC</strong></p><p>Here you will learn how to save the project and then export it. If you have already saved the project in the beginning, skip reading this part and directly hit the “Export” button.</p><p>Contrarily, you can also directly export your files without saving the project. But you won’t be able to make changes to the same project in the future as all source files will be lost. Therefore, saving the project and then exporting files is recommended.</p><p>So, if you’re done with step 4, save your project before going further.</p><p>You can go to the “File” tab, choose “Save Project,” and rename the video.</p><p><img                       lazyload                     src="/images/loading.svg"                     data-src="https://images.wondershare.com/filmora/article-images/2022/07/avi-video-rotators-16.jpg"                      alt="avi video rotators"                ></p><p>Rename your file and click on the “Save” button.</p><p><img                       lazyload                     src="/images/loading.svg"                     data-src="https://images.wondershare.com/filmora/article-images/2022/07/avi-video-rotators-17.jpg"                      alt="avi video rotators"                ></p><p>The new name will appear at the top of Filmora’s interface.</p><p><img                       lazyload                     src="/images/loading.svg"                     data-src="https://images.wondershare.com/filmora/article-images/2022/07/avi-video-rotators-18.jpg"                      alt="avi video rotators"                ></p><p>Lastly, click the “Export” button to save the file on your computer.</p><p>F 17</p><p><img                       lazyload                     src="/images/loading.svg"                     data-src="https://images.wondershare.com/filmora/article-images/2022/07/avi-video-rotators-19.jpg"                      alt="avi video rotators"                ></p><h2 id="Part-2-Top-3-Free-Video-Rotators-on-Windows"><a href="#Part-2-Top-3-Free-Video-Rotators-on-Windows" class="headerlink" title="Part 2: Top 3 Free Video Rotators on Windows"></a>Part 2: Top 3 Free Video Rotators on Windows</h2><p>No luck with finding free movie rotators for your Windows operating system?

However, one of the best features of this video converter-cum-rotator is the video remux. That means you can convert the video container format without changing the original size.</p><p>Contrarily, XMedia Recode allows you to rotate and convert videos for countless devices, such as iPhone, iPad, Android, Xbox360, and more. But all this can be done only through Windows operating system. You can download this tool without any paid subscription.

Where can I download PC games for free?"></a>1. Where can I download PC games for free?</h4><p>There are plenty of free PC games available in the App Store &amp; Microsoft stores. You can play &amp; download free mini-games from sites like myplaycity.com &amp; miniclip.com. Major game distributing platforms such as Steam, GOG, Uplay, Itch.io, etc. provide numerous free-to-play titles. These sites also frequently hold limited-time giveaways of paid games.</p><h4 id="2-What-is-the-safest-website-to-download-free-games"><a href="#2-What-is-the-safest-website-to-download-free-games" class="headerlink" title="2. What is the safest website to download free games?"></a>2. What is the safest website to download free games?</h4><p>Downloading free games puts you at the risk of malware attacks, phishing, spoofing, viruses, and more. Therefore, we highly recommend that you don’t download games from websites without a proper security check. The safest website for downloading free PC games would be Steam. It is a cross-platform game distribution service with thousands of free-to-play games. All the games are vigorously checked and tested for security vulnerabilities. The increasing support for gaming on Linux makes it critical for Linux gamers.</p><h4 id="3-Can-we-download-PC-games-on-Android"><a href="#3-Can-we-download-PC-games-on-Android" class="headerlink" title="3. Can we download PC games on Android?"></a>3. Can we download PC games on Android?</h4><p>There isn’t a straightforward answer to this question. By ‘download,’ if you mean installing or playing, you can only play specific ported titles. GTA San Andreas is one such PC game ported to Android. Some game streaming services like Stadia &amp; Nvidia Geforce Now let you play PC games on Android. However, you can certainly download (not install or play) PC games on Android. There are a few things to keep in mind though. Android internal (&amp; in some cases external) storage does not support single files that are over 4 GB in size. For downloading files greater than 4 GB, you will have to flash your storage in the exFAT or NTFS file system. Moreover, game distributors such as Steam do not allow downloading PC games on Android.</p><p><a href="https://tools.techidaily.com/wondershare/filmora/download/"><img                       lazyload                     src="/images/loading.svg"                     data-src="https://images.wondershare.com/filmora/guide/download-btn-win.jpg"                      alt="Download Win Version"                ></a><a href="https://tools.techidaily.com/wondershare/filmora/download/"><img                       lazyload                     src="/images/loading.svg"                     data-src="https://images.wondershare.com/filmora/guide/download-btn-mac.jpg"                      alt="Download Mac Version"                ></a></p><p><img                       lazyload                     src="/images/loading.svg"                     data-src="https://images.wondershare.com/filmora/article-images/2022/11/group-1.png"                      alt="endorse"                ></p><p><img                       lazyload                     src="/images/loading.svg"                     data-src="https://images.wondershare.com/filmora/article-images/ollie-mattison.jpg"                      alt="author avatar"                ></p><p>Ollie Mattison</p><p>Ollie Mattison is a writer and a lover of all things video.</p><p>Follow @Ollie Mattison</p><p><span class="atpl-alsoreadstyle">Also read:</span></p><div><ul><li><a href="https://video-creation-software.techidaily.com/2024-approved-unleash-your-creativity-best-free-and-paid-3d-video-makers/"><u>2024 Approved Unleash Your Creativity Best Free and Paid 3D Video Makers</u></a></li><li><a href="https://video-creation-software.techidaily.com/updated-2024-approved-exclusive-offers-top-4-methods-to-score-filmora-discounts/"><u>Updated 2024 Approved Exclusive Offers Top 4 Methods to Score Filmora Discounts</u></a></li><li><a href="https://video-creation-software.techidaily.com/new-in-2024-imovie-alternatives-top-free-options-for-video-editing/"><u>New In 2024, IMovie Alternatives Top Free Options for Video Editing</u></a></li><li><a href="https://video-creation-software.techidaily.com/new-get-creative-with-instagram-stop-motion-a-comprehensive-tutorial-for-2024/"><u>New Get Creative with Instagram Stop Motion A Comprehensive Tutorial for 2024</u></a></li><li><a href="https://video-creation-software.techidaily.com/mastering-animation-drawing-a-guide-to-the-best-software-for-2024/"><u>Mastering Animation Drawing A Guide to the Best Software for 2024</u></a></li><li><a href="https://video-creation-software.techidaily.com/new-2024-approved-the-popularity-of-video-content-on-social-media-networks-has-been-soaring-in-the-last-couple-of-years-and-it-is-only-reasonable-to-expect-/"><u>New 2024 Approved The Popularity of Video Content on Social Media Networks Has Been Soaring in the Last Couple of Years, and It Is only Reasonable to Expect This Trend to Continue.

VHS effects are among the most popular, as seen in internet photos and mobile apps. If you know how to make VHS effects, you can join the trend by making vintage-style videos.</p><p>Fortunately, you don’t have to reshoot your video using an analog camera and transfer the movie to a VCR video format to achieve the effect of an old recording (with the date on the screen, tracking lines, and other telltale indications). It’s made up of a few similar layers with slightly different Effects and a fun overlay layer to give it that tubular, radical ‘90s vibe.</p><p>In this article, you will learn how to add VHS effects to a video in Final Cut Pro X, how to use VHS video effects, and some common VHS filter choices to use in your next project, so keep reading:</p><h2 id="Part1-How-to-do-VHS-effect-in-FCPX"><a href="#Part1-How-to-do-VHS-effect-in-FCPX" class="headerlink" title="Part1: How to do VHS effect in FCPX?"></a>Part1: How to do VHS effect in FCPX?</h2><p>A VHS effect is a textured, warped effect that looks like an outdated analog videotape cassette recording. Adding this antique effect to an edit adds a fantastic old-school discord. How often should you utilize these glitchy and vintage effects? When the mood you’re trying to create begs for some visual or aural distortion. Perhaps you need to recreate the appearance of discovered film or express a dramatic flashback to a character’s history. In any case, VHS tapes and glitch effects are pretty trendy right now.</p><p><img                       lazyload                     src="/images/loading.svg"                     data-src="https://images.wondershare.com/filmora/images/final-cut-pro/vhs_effect.jpg"                      alt="vhs_effect"                ></p><p>If you want to know how to add VHS effect to your videos without any plugins in Final Cut Pro X, then follow these steps:</p><p>Open Final Cut Pro and click on New Project.</p><p>Name your project as VHS effect in the Project Name section.

VHS effects are among the most popular, as seen in internet photos and mobile apps. If you know how to make VHS effects, you can join the trend by making vintage-style videos.</p><p>Fortunately, you don’t have to reshoot your video using an analog camera and transfer the movie to a VCR video format to achieve the effect of an old recording (with the date on the screen, tracking lines, and other telltale indications). It’s made up of a few similar layers with slightly different Effects and a fun overlay layer to give it that tubular, radical ‘90s vibe.</p><p>In this article, you will learn how to add VHS effects to a video in Final Cut Pro X, how to use VHS video effects, and some common VHS filter choices to use in your next project, so keep reading:</p><h2 id="Part1-How-to-do-VHS-effect-in-FCPX"><a href="#Part1-How-to-do-VHS-effect-in-FCPX" class="headerlink" title="Part1: How to do VHS effect in FCPX?"></a>Part1: How to do VHS effect in FCPX?</h2><p>A VHS effect is a textured, warped effect that looks like an outdated analog videotape cassette recording. Adding this antique effect to an edit adds a fantastic old-school discord. How often should you utilize these glitchy and vintage effects? When the mood you’re trying to create begs for some visual or aural distortion. Perhaps you need to recreate the appearance of discovered film or express a dramatic flashback to a character’s history. In any case, VHS tapes and glitch effects are pretty trendy right now.</p><p><img                       lazyload                     src="/images/loading.svg"                     data-src="https://images.wondershare.com/filmora/images/final-cut-pro/vhs_effect.jpg"                      alt="vhs_effect"                ></p><p>If you want to know how to add VHS effect to your videos without any plugins in Final Cut Pro X, then follow these steps:</p><p>Open Final Cut Pro and click on New Project.</p><p>Name your project as VHS effect in the Project Name section.

However, if video editing is new to you, consider <a class="link"   href="https://tools.techidaily.com/wondershare/filmora/download/" >Wondershare Filmora for Mac <i class="fa-regular fa-arrow-up-right-from-square fa-sm"></i></a>.

Adding titles is what this article is about.</p><h4 id="DEFINITIONS"><a href="#DEFINITIONS" class="headerlink" title="DEFINITIONS"></a>DEFINITIONS</h4><p>Just to keep us all on the same page, here are my definitions of key terms related to text:</p><ul><li>Text or titles. Words placed on the screen. I use these terms interchangeably.</li><li>Superimpose. Text displayed on the the screen with other video below it. These are also called “supers” or “keys.”</li><li>Full-screen. Text which occupies the entire screen.</li><li>Lower-third. Text which fits below a person talking; in the “lower-third” of the screen.</li><li>Info-graphics. Full-screen text which is superimposed on a graphic, generally used to convey technical information. Typical uses are sports statistics or other information which is easier to convey using text than having someone read the words.</li></ul><h4 id="JUST-THE-BASICS"><a href="#JUST-THE-BASICS" class="headerlink" title="JUST THE BASICS"></a>JUST THE BASICS</h4><p><img                       lazyload                     src="/images/loading.svg"                     data-src="https://images.wondershare.com/multimedia/titles001.jpg"                      alt="remote"                ></p><p>I’d like to introduce “Yertle,” he’s a sea turtle and the star of this article. (Footage courtesy of Jim Walker and Lobsters Gone Wild Productions.)</p><p>At its simplest, we use titles to display his (its?) name.</p><p><img                       lazyload                     src="/images/loading.svg"                     data-src="https://images.wondershare.com/multimedia/titles002.jpg"                      alt="remote"                ></p><p>In the Timeline, put the playhead where you want a title to appear and type Shift+Control+T. This inserts the default lower-third title at the position of the playhead. The title, like almost all titles, has a default duration of 10:00 seconds.</p><p><img                       lazyload                     src="/images/loading.svg"                     data-src="https://images.wondershare.com/multimedia/titles003.jpg"                      alt="remote"                ></p><p>Look at the Browser and see the results of your work. A lower-third title is superimposed over the video in the lower left corner. (I’ll talk about formatting the text in a few paragraphs.)</p><p>NOTE: The big limitation of this lower-third title is that it can only be positioned in the left corner. Moving it to the center or right corner requires manual adjustment.</p><p>You position or trim a title the same as any video clip: drag the clip to a different location, or drag an edge to change its duration.</p><p>Select that title and delete it by pressing the Delete key.</p><p><img                       lazyload                     src="/images/loading.svg"                     data-src="https://images.wondershare.com/multimedia/titles004.jpg"                      alt="remote"                ></p><p>This time, type Control+T and the default full-screen title appears in the center of the screen. Again, this has a default duration of 10 seconds.</p><p><img                       lazyload                     src="/images/loading.svg"                     data-src="https://images.wondershare.com/multimedia/titles005.jpg"                      alt="remote"                ></p><p>If you look right in the center of the screen, you’ll see the word “Title.” Yes, its darn near invisible. And, yes, it looks, um, ugly. However, we have a TON of formatting control to make this look however we want.</p><p>Select and delete that full-screen title.</p><p>There’s one more way to apply a title: dragging from the Titles Browser.</p><p><img                       lazyload                     src="/images/loading.svg"                     data-src="https://images.wondershare.com/multimedia/titles006.jpg"                      alt="remote"                ></p><p>Click the Title icon in the Toolbar. This displays the contents of the Title Browser. The column on the left displays title categories, the icons on the right indicate individual titles, the search box at the bottom allows you to search for specific titles by name, while the number in the lower right indicates the number of titles currently displayed. (Your number may not match mine because I’ve added a few custom titles to my system.)</p><p><img                       lazyload                     src="/images/loading.svg"                     data-src="https://images.wondershare.com/multimedia/titles007.jpg"                      alt="remote"                ></p><p>Let’s add a totally ridiculous title to our turtle - drag Clouds from the Title Browser and place it above the clip at the point where you want a title to appear.</p><p>NOTE: I’m using a marker in the Timeline to help me find the same place in a clip so my screen shots are consistent. Markers are not needed in any way for titles.</p><p><img                       lazyload                     src="/images/loading.svg"                     data-src="https://images.wondershare.com/multimedia/titles008.jpg"                      alt="remote"                ></p><p>Um, yeah. So, some titles look more professional than others… You can delete this title now.</p><p>So, we:</p><ul><li>Add titles using keyboard shortcuts</li><li>Drag titles from the Title Browser</li><li>Change position by dragging the title</li><li>Change duration by dragging the edge of the clip</li><li>Delete a title by selecting it and pressing the Delete key</li></ul><h4 id="CHANGING-TEXT"><a href="#CHANGING-TEXT" class="headerlink" title="CHANGING TEXT"></a>CHANGING TEXT</h4><p><img                       lazyload                     src="/images/loading.svg"                     data-src="https://images.wondershare.com/multimedia/titles009.jpg"                      alt="remote"                ></p><p>Add a new full-screen title (type Control+T) to the Timeline. To change the text in a title, double-click it in the Viewer. Here, I’ve changed my title to “An Undersea Adventure.”</p><p>NOTE: We can also change the text using the Inspector. I’ll show you how in a few paragraphs. Pick whichever method is easiest for you.</p><p>All text, in any title, can be changed by double-clicking it in the Viewer to select it, then typing the new text you want to use.</p><h4 id="FORMATTING-TEXT"><a href="#FORMATTING-TEXT" class="headerlink" title="FORMATTING TEXT"></a>FORMATTING TEXT</h4><p><img                       lazyload                     src="/images/loading.svg"                     data-src="https://images.wondershare.com/multimedia/titles011.jpg"                      alt="remote"                ></p><p>You can format any text that you can select. This means that you can format entire phrases, words, or individual letters differently. For this article, I will format everything the same, because once you know how this works, you can experiment on your own.</p><p>Here, I selected my entire title and opened the Inspector (shortcut Cmd+4). Click the Text tab at the top. This section of the Inspector allows you to format the text.</p><p>NOTE: The text box near the top of the panel is the second place you can select text for formatting.</p><p><img                       lazyload                     src="/images/loading.svg"                     data-src="https://images.wondershare.com/multimedia/titles011.jpg"                      alt="remote"                ></p><p>If you want a fast way to format text, click the word “Normal” at the top. This displays a menu filled with different text formats. Some of these formats look pretty dreadful; the rest look worse.</p><p>NOTE: You can create your own text styles. Refer to the Help for information on how.</p><p><img                       lazyload                     src="/images/loading.svg"                     data-src="https://images.wondershare.com/multimedia/titles012.jpg"                      alt="remote"                ></p><p>The Basic section of the Inspector allows you to change fonts, size, alignment… all the standard font settings we see in other programs. Here, I’ve changed the font to Hobo Std, at 167 points.</p><p>While many of these settings you already know there are a few you may not:</p><ul><li>Line spacing. Adjusts the vertical distance between lines within the same paragraph.</li><li>Tracking. Adjusts the horizontal spacing between letters.</li><li>Baseline. Adjusts the vertical spacing of text compared to the horizontal line running thru the center of the white circle in the Viewer.</li></ul><p><img                       lazyload                     src="/images/loading.svg"                     data-src="https://images.wondershare.com/multimedia/titles013.jpg"                      alt="remote"                ></p><p>The Face section allows us to change font color, opacity and blue. Outline and Glow allows us to add, not surprisingly, outlines and glows. You can adjust these as you see fit - I tend not to add outlines or glows.</p><p><img                       lazyload                     src="/images/loading.svg"                     data-src="https://images.wondershare.com/multimedia/titles017.jpg"                      alt="remote"                ></p><p>However, I STRONGLY recommend adding drop shadows to all text that you want viewers to read.

This style of making animated films is done by taking objects, either dolls with joints or soft clay items, and manipulating them. The physical manipulations and changes are then photographed. Each photograph acts as a frame, and when you play the frames together quickly, it looks like the objects have been animated.</p><p>If you want to make this type of animation, then you want to find the best <strong>stop motion animation software</strong> that you can find. Some options out there are even free! In this article, we’re going to share the 8 best options for stop motion animation software, separating them by whether they are for Mac or PC.</p><table><thead><tr><th><a href="#part1">1 - Wondershare Filmora</a> [Video]</th><th><a href="#part2">2 - Dragonframe</a></th><th><a href="#part3">3 - Stop Motion Studio</a></th><th><a href="#part4">4 - Boinx iStopMotion</a></th></tr></thead><tbody><tr><td><a href="#part5">5 - Stop Motion Pro</a></td><td><a href="#part6">6 - Frames</a></td><td><a href="#part7">7 - iKITMovie</a></td><td><a href="#part8">8 - MonkeyJam</a></td></tr></tbody></table><p><a class="link"   href="https://tools.techidaily.com/wondershare/filmora/download/" >Make Stop Motion Video <i class="fa-regular fa-arrow-up-right-from-square fa-sm"></i></a></p><p>For Win 7 or later (64-bit)</p><p><img                       lazyload                     src="/images/loading.svg"                     data-src="https://images.wondershare.com/filmora/images/store/secure.png"                      alt="Filmora secure download"                > Secure Download</p><p><a class="link"   href="https://tools.techidaily.com/wondershare/filmora/download/" >Make Stop Motion Video <i class="fa-regular fa-arrow-up-right-from-square fa-sm"></i></a></p><p>For macOS 10.14 or later</p><p><img                       lazyload                     src="/images/loading.svg"                     data-src="https://images.wondershare.com/filmora/images/store/secure.png"                      alt="Filmora secure download"                > Secure Download</p><p><a href="https://app.adjust.com/w06dr6m%5F19za1f6"><img                       lazyload                     src="/images/loading.svg"                     data-src="https://images.wondershare.com/assets/images-common/badges-apple.svg"                      alt="iOS"                ></a> <a href="https://app.adjust.com/w06dr6m%5F19za1f6"><img                       lazyload                     src="/images/loading.svg"                     data-src="https://images.wondershare.com/assets/images-common/badges-google.svg"                      alt="Android"                ></a></p><p><a class="link"   href="https://tools.techidaily.com/wondershare/filmora/download/" >Try It Free &gt;&gt; <i class="fa-regular fa-arrow-up-right-from-square fa-sm"></i></a></p><h3 id="1-Filmora"><a href="#1-Filmora" class="headerlink" title="1.

The Stop Motion Studio does everything from helping you to take great pictures to making a live green screen while you’re out and about. There’s a free trial, and the prices are reasonable.</p><p><img                       lazyload                     src="/images/loading.svg"                     data-src="https://images.wondershare.com/filmora/article-images/Stop-Motion-Studio.JPG"                      alt="Stop Motion Studio"                ></p><h3 id="4-Boinx-iStopMotion"><a href="#4-Boinx-iStopMotion" class="headerlink" title="4.

It’s got the most affordable licensing cost out of all of these choices, and they can work with you if you need to get multiple licenses for classrooms.</p><p><img                       lazyload                     src="/images/loading.svg"                     data-src="https://images.wondershare.com/filmora/filmorapro/Boinx-iStopMotion.jpg"                      alt="Boinx iStopMotion"                ></p><h3 id="5-Eclipse-Stop-Motion-Pro"><a href="#5-Eclipse-Stop-Motion-Pro" class="headerlink" title="5.

Not only can it make and edit videos, but, when you connect it to your camera, you can control angles, zoom, and more. It even has lip-syncing capabilities and a multi-track editor, which makes it easy to add music and voices.</p><p><img                       lazyload                     src="/images/loading.svg"                     data-src="https://images.wondershare.com/filmora/filmorapro/Stop-Motion-Pro.jpg"                      alt="Stop Motion Pro"                ></p><h3 id="6-Frames"><a href="#6-Frames" class="headerlink" title="6.

You can also use green-screen effects to unleash more imagination if you are an advanced user. The system requirement is low with only 2GB RAM. After making the stop motion animation, directly upload it to YouTube.</p><p><img                       lazyload                     src="/images/loading.svg"                     data-src="https://images.wondershare.com/filmora/filmorapro/iKITMovie.jpg"                      alt="iKITMovie"                ></p><h3 id="8-MonkeyJam"><a href="#8-MonkeyJam" class="headerlink" title="8.
