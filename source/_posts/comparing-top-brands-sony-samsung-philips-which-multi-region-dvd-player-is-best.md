 _Posted by [Kaylee Wood](https://www.quora.com/profile/Amanda-Hu-21) | Last update: April 28, 2020_

**Multi region DVD player**, as its name indicates, can play DVDs of all regions without external help to decode the DVD region code. To choose the best multi region DVD player, you should not only look the brand and price, but also the multifunction, stability, durability and the convenience it brings to you. Here I list three models of all region DVD players for you to choose and they are produced by the well known DVD player manufacturers – Sony, Samsung and Phillips.

**Better Quality Multi-region DVD player – Sony SR 370**

Sony SR 370 is a multi region DVD player for all zone code with USB input which features essential playback functions and supports MP3 and JPEG files copied on a DVD disc. Free region code 0 1 2 3 4 5 6 7 8\. It plays all region DVDs well, it does NTSC and PAL very well but it has no HDMI out.

**Low End Multi Region DVD Player – Sumsung DVD-E360**

**All Region DVD Player 1080P HDMI Upscaling - Phillips DVP 2880**

Phillips DVP 2880/F7 multi region 1080p HDMI upscaling DVD player owns the ability to play all regions DVDs, PAL/NTSC DVDs on American TV and upconverts them up to 1080p resolution with HDMI cable. It is compact and trouble free only the red signal light is a bit confusing. 

The above three amazing multi region DVD players are all available to be purchased on Amazon and eBay, obviously the price aren't cheap and they are not portable to travel with you. If you can't rip your DVD content to save on your hard disk, a better choice it to install a free multi region DVD player software on your portable computer, so you can play all region DVDs anywhere you want.
