## What are the common problems people often face when they cut and join videos?

Before diving into how to cut and join videos with Wondershare Filmora video cutter and joiner, we want you to get a glimpse of problems people often face when they deal with this issue so that you will be having a clearer idea as to what kind of video cutter and joiner you are really looking for.

[![cut and join video clips](https://images.wondershare.com/multimedia/video-editor/troubleshooting.jpg)](https://images.wondershare.com/multimedia/video-editor/troubleshooting.jpg)

Often, instead of solving your problem, the choice of a wrong tool can cause you much more headaches, such as:

* The poor-designed user interface, the tool is very difficult to use
* Only supports running on limited Windows OS such as Windows 7, not applicable for Windows 8 and Windows 10, no Mac version
* It takes an eternity for two videos clips to be merged
* Very few video formats supported/ only videos with the same formats can be merged
* Only videos with the same aspect ratio can be merged
* Poor quality on the output/resulting file, serious loss of quality from the sourcing files
* Painful to export to multiple devices

In light of those above-mentioned reasons, it is wise for you to identify the following points before you move forward with your endeavor:

* The operation system of your computer, a Windows 7, or Windows8, Mac OS 10.10?
* The formats of your source video clips, .mp4, .avi, .flv, or any other popular formats?
* To what device you are planning to export your resulting file to/play your resulting file on?

Follow this process we are about to outline and you will have no issues with your video chopping and merging experience. It is worth mentioning that this video cutting and joining tool works on all Windows OS (Windows 10/8/7/XP/Vista), Mac OS (OS X 10.10 or later).

## What are the common problems people often face when they cut and join videos?

Before diving into how to cut and join videos with Wondershare Filmora video cutter and joiner, we want you to get a glimpse of problems people often face when they deal with this issue so that you will be having a clearer idea as to what kind of video cutter and joiner you are really looking for.

[![cut and join video clips](https://images.wondershare.com/multimedia/video-editor/troubleshooting.jpg)](https://images.wondershare.com/multimedia/video-editor/troubleshooting.jpg)

Often, instead of solving your problem, the choice of a wrong tool can cause you much more headaches, such as:

* The poor-designed user interface, the tool is very difficult to use
* Only supports running on limited Windows OS such as Windows 7, not applicable for Windows 8 and Windows 10, no Mac version
* It takes an eternity for two videos clips to be merged
* Very few video formats supported/ only videos with the same formats can be merged
* Only videos with the same aspect ratio can be merged
* Poor quality on the output/resulting file, serious loss of quality from the sourcing files
* Painful to export to multiple devices

In light of those above-mentioned reasons, it is wise for you to identify the following points before you move forward with your endeavor:

* The operation system of your computer, a Windows 7, or Windows8, Mac OS 10.10?
* The formats of your source video clips, .mp4, .avi, .flv, or any other popular formats?
* To what device you are planning to export your resulting file to/play your resulting file on?
