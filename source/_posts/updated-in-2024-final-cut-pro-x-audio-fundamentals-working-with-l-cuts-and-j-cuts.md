## Part 2: Top 3  Studio for Mac Alternatives

### 1\. Final Cut Pro

Final Cut Pro is a professional video editing software from Apple for anybody looking for a more powerful video editor for their Macs than the included iMovie.

### 2\. Lightworks

Another free video editing software that works as a good replacement for pinnacle studio for Mac is Lightworks. It's packed with many useful features, and although there is paid version, the free version has all the bells and whistles needed for beginners.
