## Part 4: How to Share and [Download Your WhatsApp Status Video](https://tools.techidaily.com/wondershare/filmora/download/)?

WhatsApp debuted the 'Status' feature a few years ago. Many people use both Instagram and WhatsApp to update their status. It happens that, at times, you might want to save your friends' statuses as a remembrance or for some other reason.

Below are the steps you need to follow for saving WhatsApp status and then sharing it further.

**Method 1: Save It with File Manager**

Step 1: View the status that you wish to save. This creates a temporary copy on the phone's storage.

Step 2: Open your **File Manager app**. Click on the hamburger icon (three dots) present on the right corner of the screen.

## Part 5: FAQs about WhatsApp Status

**Who can see my WhatsApp status?**

It's only possible for someone to see your status updates if both of you have each other's phone numbers in your phone's address book. You have the option of sharing your status updates with everyone in your contact list or just those you specify. Unless you change this setting, your status updates are visible to everyone on your contact list.

**What is the benefit of using WhatsApp status?**

The WhatsApp status feature allows the user to share pictures, text, videos, and GIFs on their account. The best part is that these disappear after 24 hours and are end-to-end encrypted.
