![ kapwing stop motion maker export & share](https://images.wondershare.com/filmora/article-images/kapwing-stop-motion-maker-export.jpg)

In case you created a stop motion video while you were logged out of your Kapwing account, the platform will add a watermark to it, and you must sign in to [remove](https://tools.techidaily.com/wondershare/filmora/download/) it.

Creating a stop motion video with Clideo won’t take much more than a few minutes of your time, regardless of the format in which the source video is saved. After you upload the footage from which you want to create a stop motion video to the platform, you just have to set the speed at which frames are going to be displayed and the frequency at which [frames are going to be extracted](https://tools.techidaily.com/wondershare/filmora/download/) from the source footage.

Optionally you can click on the Append Reversed Video checkbox if you want to play the stop motion video backward. Clideo also lets you choose the format of the output video, which enables you to export videos WebM, MP4, MOV and numerous other file formats.

**Price:** Free

![ Stop Motion Animator](https://images.wondershare.com/filmora/article-images/stop-motion-animator-chrome-extension.jpg)

This is a simple add-on for Google Chrome that enables you to use a computer’s webcam to create stop motion videos. This tool only offers basic options, which means that you can snap photos, adjust their [playback speed](https://tools.techidaily.com/wondershare/filmora/download/), erase them or record audio.

However, Stop Motion Animator is far from being a perfect choice for video content creators as it can only be used with a webcam.

Anyone can create stop motion animations with this web-based app, even if they don’t have any previous video editing experience. However, before you can start creating using Cloud Stop Motion you must first create an account and grant the app access to your computer’s webcam. Afterward, you just have to start a new project and start snapping pictures.

## Part 2: How to Make Stop Motion Video from Photos Online

Stop motion videos are composed of sequences of still images that create the illusion that the object in the shots are moving. The Cloud Stop Motion app offers a free and easy way to make stop motion animations directly from the web-browser using the [web camera](https://tools.techidaily.com/wondershare/filmora/download/).

After you sign in to your account on this platform, you should click on the New Project option that is located in the Projects tab.

![ Create Stop Motion with Captured Photos  - create project](https://images.wondershare.com/filmora/article-images/create-project-in-cloud-stop-motion.jpg)

Once the Animation window loads, you will be able to see the timeline below the preview window that shows everything your web camera can see. After you composed your shot, you should simply click on the Camera button that is located on the right side of the screen, then move the object that is in the shot and click on the camera button again. You should repeat this process as many times as necessary until you have captured all the frames you want to include in your stop motion animation.

![ Capture Photos in  Cloud Stop Motion](https://images.wondershare.com/filmora/article-images/capture-photos-with-cloud-stop-motion.jpg)

In case you want to alter the frame rate, you can click on the Project Settings icon that is located at the top of the toolbar in the upper left corner of the screen.

![ Cloud Stop Motion Project Settings](https://images.wondershare.com/filmora/article-images/cloud-stop-motion-project-settings.jpg)

Clicking on the Audio icon will grant you access to the Cloud Stop Motion’s [sound library](https://tools.techidaily.com/wondershare/filmora/download/) that contains hundreds of songs and audio effects. What’s more, you can also record voiceovers with this online stop motion maker, although you must first give the app permission to access your computer’s microphone.

![    Cloud Stop Motion Audio Library](https://images.wondershare.com/filmora/article-images/cloud-stop-motion-audio-library.jpg)

Cloud Stop Motion is equipped with fully customizable title, credit, speech bubble, and chapter heading templates and you just have to click on them to add them to a project.

![    Cloud Stop Motion Titles Library](https://images.wondershare.com/filmora/article-images/cloud-stop-motion-insert-titles.jpg)

Click on the Export button, after you complete all work on a project and proceed to choose the video’s aspect ratio or its export size. Keep in mind that changing a stop motion video’s output format is not possible since you can only [create MP4 videos](https://tools.techidaily.com/wondershare/filmora/download/) with Cloud Stop Motion.

![    Cloud Stop Motion Export Options](https://images.wondershare.com/filmora/article-images/cloud-stop-motion-export-options.jpg)

All projects are automatically saved and they can be accessed every time you sign in to your account on Cloud Stop Motion, which enables you to create different versions of the same stop motion videos.

## Part 3: How to Make Stop Motion Videos from Videos Online

In case you don’t have the photos you can use to create a stop motion animation, platforms like Kapwing allow you to turn a regular video into a stop motion video. All you need to do is upload a video clip from your computer or via a URL to Kapwing and the platform will automatically generate a stop motion video. One of the best part is that Kapwing also provides a sample if you don’t want to upload your own footage.

![    Import footage to Kapwing](https://images.wondershare.com/filmora/article-images/import-stop-motion-footage-in-kapwing.jpg)

After the upload process is completed a new window will load where you can choose the speed at which frames are displayed on the screen and pick the rate at which frames are taken from the source video.

![ kapwing stop motion maker interface](https://images.wondershare.com/filmora/article-images/kapwing-stop-motion-maker.jpg)

While adjusting these settings you should keep in mind that lowering a [video’s frame rate](https://tools.techidaily.com/wondershare/filmora/download/) too much can result in choppy footage and uneven movement of the objects in the stop motion video you’re creating.

Kapwing also offers the option to [play the video in reverse](https://tools.techidaily.com/wondershare/filmora/download/), but finding the right context to use this feature can prove to be a challenging task. Click on the Create button when ready to export the stop motion video and wait for the platform to generate the video.

![ kapwing stop motion maker export & share](https://images.wondershare.com/filmora/article-images/kapwing-stop-motion-maker-export.jpg)

Afterward, you can choose to download, edit or share the video on Facebook, Instagram or Twitter. In case you created a stop motion video while you were logged out of your Kapwing account, the platform will add a watermark to it, and you must sign in to [remove](https://tools.techidaily.com/wondershare/filmora/download/) it.

**Conclusion**

Finding ways to produce content that stands out on social media is becoming increasingly difficult as video content is growing more popular. Online stop motion makers provide a simple way to use photos and videos to create attention-grabbing videos.

[![Download Win Version](https://images.wondershare.com/filmora/guide/download-btn-win.jpg)](https://tools.techidaily.com/wondershare/filmora/download/)[![Download Mac Version](https://images.wondershare.com/filmora/guide/download-btn-mac.jpg)](https://tools.techidaily.com/wondershare/filmora/download/)

Filmora has been used by many YouTubers and [gets reviewed by many authorities](https://tools.techidaily.com/wondershare/filmora/download/).
