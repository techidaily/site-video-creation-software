"Does anyone know any H.265 player which plays x265 HEVC codec file? I already tried VLC, POT PLAYER, KMPLAYER, GOM PLAYER...!! Not working properly! Any help?"

H.265/HEVC is a cutting-edge, high-efficiency video codec that particularly useful for streaming 4K/8K video. Higher efficiency usually comes with complexity and that is why H.265 codec is far more difficult to play. Here shows how you can playback HEVC on your PC or Mac with a high-efficiency **H.265/HEVC player**.

H.265, also known as HEVC, short for High Efficiency Video Coding which is designed to substantially improve coding efficiency compared to H.264/AVC. HEVC encoders can trade off computational complexity, compression rate, robustness to errors, etc. Playing H.265 files can be tricky, so a powerful H.265/HEVC video player is required which not only plays the specific H.265/HEVC video file but also compatible with your OS edition. 

_\- "As the problems I occurred, the latest VLC media player still does not support H.265 video playback perfectly: there is stutters, not showing audio, etc issues."_

**Why some players claim to be the best x265 player but indeed they are not working when the users trying to playback H.265 files?** 

1.For some operating system such as Windows 10, it supports playing HEVC videos natively. So, some H.265 players actually can't play H.265/HEVC files without the supporting of the specific OS.  
2\. Other media player needed [HEVC/H.265 codec pack](https://tools.techidaily.com/5kplayer/video-music-player/) or third party H.265 decoder software to help decoding the specific X265/HEVC files, means this sort of H.265/HEVC player won't play H.265 files solely.

[**H.265 vs. H.264**](https://tools.techidaily.com/winxdvd/products/)  
 H.264 is an incredibly popular codec nowadays and supports 4K UHD. H.265 HEVC is a successor to the well known H.264/MPEG-4 AVC video compression standard. It is said that H.265/HEVC is doubled the data compression ratio compared to H.264/AVC at the same level of video quality. And H.265 allows for 4K and 8K resolution video to be compressed and streamed on an internet connection. Simply put, an H.265 player like 5KPlayer which truly support H.265 video playback will play H.264 files as well.
