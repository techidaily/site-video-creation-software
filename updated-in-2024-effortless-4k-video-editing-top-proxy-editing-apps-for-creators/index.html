<p>Shooting videos in high resolutions can help you create visually impressive content your followers on social media are going to adore. The only trouble is that the size of 4K videos can slow you down during the video editing process if your computer doesn’t have enough RAM memory or processing power. Additionally, quite a few inexpensive or free video editing apps don’t allow their users to create low-resolution proxy files that make the process of editing 4K videos much faster. That’s why in this article we are going to take you through the best 8 video editors you can use for 4K proxy video editing.</p>

However, even if you have a computer setup that can easily support processing of the 4K video files, proxy editing can still be useful as it can reduce the amount of time you will have to spend on performing complex video editing tasks. Let’s take a look at some of the best video editors that support proxy editing.</p>
<h4 id="1-Filmora"><a href="#1-Filmora" class="headerlink" title="1.

<p>The wide range of video editing options, support for nearly all popular video file formats or quick and simple exporting process are only a few reasons why Filmora is one of the best video editors you can use this year. Creating proxy files in Filmora is not a difficult task, because the software generates them automatically for you. You just have to choose between the <strong>1280x720p or 1920x1080p resolutions</strong> and Filmora will create proxies for all media files that are larger than the resolution you’ve selected. However, the amount of time Filmora is going to need to create proxies depends on your computer’s processing power, but also on the size and the number of the RAW files you imported into a project.</p>
<h4 id="2-Adobe-Premiere-Pro-CC"><a href="#2-Adobe-Premiere-Pro-CC" class="headerlink" title="2. Adobe Premiere Pro CC"></a>2. <a class="link"   target="_blank" rel="noopener" href="https://www.adobe.com/products/premiere.html" >Adobe Premiere Pro CC <i class="fa-regular fa-arrow-up-right-from-square fa-sm"></i></a></h4><p><strong>Price:</strong> $20,99 per month, different subscription plans available</p>
<p><strong>Compatibility:</strong> Windows, macOS</p>
<p>This is probably one of the best, if not the best non-linear video editing software ever created, so it is hardly surprising that you can easily create proxy files for all videos you use in a project you create in Adobe Premiere Pro. So, to create proxy files you just need to open the folder that contains those files from the <strong>Media Browser</strong> and then click on the <strong>Ingest button</strong>. You should then click on the <strong>wrench tool</strong> and pick the <strong>Create Proxies option</strong> from the drop-down menu located next to the <strong>Ingest option</strong>. Afterward, you should select one of the available resolution presets and proceed to import the footage into the project. However, before you can start editing with proxies you have to click on the <strong>Toggle Proxy button</strong>.</p>
<h4 id="3-Final-Cut-Pro-X"><a href="#3-Final-Cut-Pro-X" class="headerlink" title="3. Final Cut Pro X"></a>3. <a class="link"   target="_blank" rel="noopener" href="https://www.apple.com/lae/final-cut-pro/" >Final Cut Pro X <i class="fa-regular fa-arrow-up-right-from-square fa-sm"></i></a></h4><p><strong>Price:</strong> Free trial available, $299,99</p>
<p><strong>Compatibility:</strong> macOS</p>
<p>Transcoding media with FCPX doesn’t require too much effort, as the software offers a couple of options that make the editing process faster. You can opt to <strong>generate optimized media files</strong> by transcoding the original video clips into <strong>Apple ProRes 422 codec</strong> format that shortens the amount of time needed for rendering and provides excellent quality of color that is required for compositing. The <strong>proxy media files</strong> will also be created by transcoding the videos to <strong>Apple ProRes 422 codec format</strong> that retains original aspect ratio and frame rate of the video clips you transcoded. It is also worth noting that FCPX transcodes <strong>all mp3 files</strong> you import into a project to <strong>MOV audio files</strong>.</p>
<h4 id="4-Vegas-Pro"><a href="#4-Vegas-Pro" class="headerlink" title="4. Vegas Pro"></a>4. <a class="link"   target="_blank" rel="noopener" href="https://www.vegascreativesoftware.com/us/" >Vegas Pro <i class="fa-regular fa-arrow-up-right-from-square fa-sm"></i></a></h4><p><strong>Price:</strong> Subscription plans start from $249,00</p>
<p><strong>Compatibility:</strong> Windows</p>
<p>This video editor is often overlooked in conversations about the most powerful video editing apps, but the tools it offers are powerful enough to enable you to edit videos at a professional level. Creating proxy files in Vegas Pro is remarkably easy, as you just have to <strong>import the files</strong> into a new project, <strong>select each file</strong> you want to transcode and then choose the <strong>Create Video Proxy</strong> option from the right-click menu. Just keep in mind that you must create proxy files before you do any actual editing because otherwise, the transcoding process is not going work.</p>
<h4 id="5-Blender"><a href="#5-Blender" class="headerlink" title="5. Blender"></a>5. <a class="link"   target="_blank" rel="noopener" href="https://www.blender.org/" >Blender <i class="fa-regular fa-arrow-up-right-from-square fa-sm"></i></a></h4><p><strong>Price:</strong> Free</p>
<p><strong>Compatibility:</strong> Linux, macOS, Windows</p>
<p>Blender is a 3D modeling and VFX software that lets you track objects or use 3D painting tools among numerous other options. Even though creating proxies with this app is not a particularly complicated process, you still have to be familiar with Blender in order to make full use of its transcoding options. The software allows you to generate proxy files whose size is only <strong>25% of the video’s original size</strong>, although you can also create proxies that have <strong>50% and 75%</strong> of the video’s original size. After you’ve adjusted the transcoding settings you should simply click on the <strong>Rebuild Proxy and Timecode Indices</strong> button.</p>
<h4 id="6-Shotcut"><a href="#6-Shotcut" class="headerlink" title="6. Shotcut"></a>6. <a class="link"   target="_blank" rel="noopener" href="https://shotcut.org/" >Shotcut <i class="fa-regular fa-arrow-up-right-from-square fa-sm"></i></a></h4><p><strong>Price:</strong> Free</p>
<p><strong>Compatibility:</strong> Windows, macOS, Linux</p>
<p>Despite the fact that this cross-platform video editor <strong>supports 4K and ProRes files</strong> that can cause it to lag at times, creating proxies in Shotcut is a highly technical process. In case you decide to make a proxy file by yourself, you will have to <strong>export a version of the file that is two or four times smaller than the original</strong>. You must also remember that you have to go through the entire process of creating proxies before you make any edits. The trick to creating proxies in Shotcut is to <strong>make a project file with the larger version of the video, then replace the larger version of the file with a smaller version of that same video file</strong>, before you actually start editing. Once you’ve completed the editing process, you can then once again add the larger source file to the project and export your video in high resolution.</p>
<h4 id="7-Lightworks"><a href="#7-Lightworks" class="headerlink" title="7. Lightworks"></a>7. <a class="link"   target="_blank" rel="noopener" href="https://www.lwks.com/" >Lightworks <i class="fa-regular fa-arrow-up-right-from-square fa-sm"></i></a></h4><p><strong>Price:</strong> Free trial available, subscription plans start at $24,99 per month</p>
<p><strong>Compatibility:</strong> Linux, macOS, Windows</p>
<p>The process of creating proxies in Lightworks is rather simple since you just have to import the video files you’d like to edit into the software and make sure they are selected before you right-click on them. Once the right-click menu appears on the screen you should click on the <strong>Media submenu</strong> and select the <strong>Make Proxies</strong> option. The amount of time Lightworks is going to need to generate the proxy files depends on the number of the source files and their size. You can then proceed to add the proxies to the timeline, edit them and Lightworks will automatically use the source files instead of proxies during the rendering process.</p>
<h4 id="8-HitFilm-Express"><a href="#8-HitFilm-Express" class="headerlink" title="8. HitFilm Express"></a>8. <a class="link"   target="_blank" rel="noopener" href="https://fxhome.com/" >HitFilm Express <i class="fa-regular fa-arrow-up-right-from-square fa-sm"></i></a></h4><p><strong>Price:</strong> Free</p>
<p><strong>Compatibility:</strong> macOS, Windows</p>
<p>Once you create a new project and import all video clips you want to use in that project into the editor you should just go to the <strong>Assets menu</strong> that is located in <strong>the Media panel</strong> and click on the <strong>Make Proxy option</strong>. You will be able to continue editing while the transcoding process is still in progress, and after the source files are transcoded they will be replaced by proxies. However, making adjustments to a proxy version of a composite shot will invalidate that proxy file, which is why it is important to make all edits on that shot before you create its proxy.</p>
<p><strong>Conclusion</strong></p>
<p>Reducing the size of video clips you use in your projects is going to save you a lot of time during the video editing process. Each video editing software we featured in this article allows its users to generate proxy files effortlessly. Which video editor are you going to be using for proxy video editing?

You must also remember that you have to go through the entire process of creating proxies before you make any edits. The trick to creating proxies in Shotcut is to <strong>make a project file with the larger version of the video, then replace the larger version of the file with a smaller version of that same video file</strong>, before you actually start editing. Once you’ve completed the editing process, you can then once again add the larger source file to the project and export your video in high resolution.</p>

<p>The process of creating proxies in Lightworks is rather simple since you just have to import the video files you’d like to edit into the software and make sure they are selected before you right-click on them. Once the right-click menu appears on the screen you should click on the <strong>Media submenu</strong> and select the <strong>Make Proxies</strong> option. The amount of time Lightworks is going to need to generate the proxy files depends on the number of the source files and their size. You can then proceed to add the proxies to the timeline, edit them and Lightworks will automatically use the source files instead of proxies during the rendering process.</p>

<p><strong>Compatibility:</strong> macOS, Windows</p>
<p>Once you create a new project and import all video clips you want to use in that project into the editor you should just go to the <strong>Assets menu</strong> that is located in <strong>the Media panel</strong> and click on the <strong>Make Proxy option</strong>. You will be able to continue editing while the transcoding process is still in progress, and after the source files are transcoded they will be replaced by proxies. However, making adjustments to a proxy version of a composite shot will invalidate that proxy file, which is why it is important to make all edits on that shot before you create its proxy.</p>
<p><strong>Conclusion</strong></p>
<p>Reducing the size of video clips you use in your projects is going to save you a lot of time during the video editing process. Each video editing software we featured in this article allows its users to generate proxy files effortlessly. Which video editor are you going to be using for proxy video editing?

<p>Shooting videos in high resolutions can help you create visually impressive content your followers on social media are going to adore. The only trouble is that the size of 4K videos can slow you down during the video editing process if your computer doesn’t have enough RAM memory or processing power. Additionally, quite a few inexpensive or free video editing apps don’t allow their users to create low-resolution proxy files that make the process of editing 4K videos much faster. That’s why in this article we are going to take you through the best 8 video editors you can use for 4K proxy video editing.</p>

Let’s take a look at some of the best video editors that support proxy editing.</p>

<p>The wide range of video editing options, support for nearly all popular video file formats or quick and simple exporting process are only a few reasons why Filmora is one of the best video editors you can use this year. Creating proxy files in Filmora is not a difficult task, because the software generates them automatically for you. You just have to choose between the <strong>1280x720p or 1920x1080p resolutions</strong> and Filmora will create proxies for all media files that are larger than the resolution you’ve selected. However, the amount of time Filmora is going to need to create proxies depends on your computer’s processing power, but also on the size and the number of the RAW files you imported into a project.</p>
<h4 id="2-Adobe-Premiere-Pro-CC-2"><a href="#2-Adobe-Premiere-Pro-CC-2" class="headerlink" title="2.

<p><strong>Compatibility:</strong> Windows, macOS</p>
<p>This is probably one of the best, if not the best non-linear video editing software ever created, so it is hardly surprising that you can easily create proxy files for all videos you use in a project you create in Adobe Premiere Pro. So, to create proxy files you just need to open the folder that contains those files from the <strong>Media Browser</strong> and then click on the <strong>Ingest button</strong>. You should then click on the <strong>wrench tool</strong> and pick the <strong>Create Proxies option</strong> from the drop-down menu located next to the <strong>Ingest option</strong>. Afterward, you should select one of the available resolution presets and proceed to import the footage into the project. However, before you can start editing with proxies you have to click on the <strong>Toggle Proxy button</strong>.</p>

<p><strong>Compatibility:</strong> macOS</p>
<p>Transcoding media with FCPX doesn’t require too much effort, as the software offers a couple of options that make the editing process faster. You can opt to <strong>generate optimized media files</strong> by transcoding the original video clips into <strong>Apple ProRes 422 codec</strong> format that shortens the amount of time needed for rendering and provides excellent quality of color that is required for compositing. The <strong>proxy media files</strong> will also be created by transcoding the videos to <strong>Apple ProRes 422 codec format</strong> that retains original aspect ratio and frame rate of the video clips you transcoded. It is also worth noting that FCPX transcodes <strong>all mp3 files</strong> you import into a project to <strong>MOV audio files</strong>.</p>

<p><strong>Compatibility:</strong> Windows</p>
<p>This video editor is often overlooked in conversations about the most powerful video editing apps, but the tools it offers are powerful enough to enable you to edit videos at a professional level. Creating proxy files in Vegas Pro is remarkably easy, as you just have to <strong>import the files</strong> into a new project, <strong>select each file</strong> you want to transcode and then choose the <strong>Create Video Proxy</strong> option from the right-click menu. Just keep in mind that you must create proxy files before you do any actual editing because otherwise, the transcoding process is not going work.</p>

<p>Blender is a 3D modeling and VFX software that lets you track objects or use 3D painting tools among numerous other options. Even though creating proxies with this app is not a particularly complicated process, you still have to be familiar with Blender in order to make full use of its transcoding options. The software allows you to generate proxy files whose size is only <strong>25% of the video’s original size</strong>, although you can also create proxies that have <strong>50% and 75%</strong> of the video’s original size. After you’ve adjusted the transcoding settings you should simply click on the <strong>Rebuild Proxy and Timecode Indices</strong> button.</p>

<p><strong>Step 2:</strong> To initiate the video stabilization process, you just have to click on the Stabilize button. The process will start automatically and its duration depends on the size of the file you’re stabilizing.</p>

<p>Text-to-Speech is an ingenious accessibility invention that has only grown more and more popular as AI has been thrown in the mix — making the converted speech sound more natural than ever!</p>
<p>As requested, in this article, we’ll be focusing on the subject of <strong>converting text to MP3</strong> format (or, rather, a tangible file that you can use for projects!)</p>

<h2 id="Part-1-What-is-TTS"><a href="#Part-1-What-is-TTS" class="headerlink" title="Part 1 What is TTS?"></a>Part 1 <strong>What is TTS?</strong></h2><p>What is Text-to-Speech? Text-to-Speech, also called TTS, as previously mentioned, is an accessibility invention. It was developed to help those with vision impairment or blindness — giving them the ability to have text read to them out loud to them (without requiring someone specifically read it out loud for them.</p>
<p>More recent development in TTS technology has allowed it to grow more useful outside of those parameters, however. Especially seeing as it is now possible to convert <strong>text to MP3 with natural voices</strong>.</p>
<h3 id="01Why-Use-Text-to-Speech-Converter"><a href="#01Why-Use-Text-to-Speech-Converter" class="headerlink" title="01Why Use Text to Speech Converter?"></a>01Why Use Text to Speech Converter?</h3><p><strong>Text-to-Speech human voice converter</strong>s are popular with content creators, and thus, they are the ones who see the most use for them (in the commercial sense). After all, it’s easy enough to convert already created content (in the form of text) into an audio file that there’s no reason not to! Especially since it means that more people would have access to their content!</p>

Getting a live voice actor to <strong>convert text to MP3</strong> for you is very expensive — since you’re paying not only for the voice-actors hours spent but also the use of the expensive equipment that they use for creating voiceovers.</p>
<p>In that regard, even PAID text-to-speech converters are easier on the budget. Making it the perfect solution for content creators who want to increase the accessibility of their content but do not have the time (to create the voiceovers themselves) or the money (to hire someone else to record it).</p>

And, depending on what you’re looking for, you might find yourself longing for extra features later on down the line. That is why, when looking to <strong>convert text to MP3</strong> we recommend considering the following:</p>
<p><strong>●</strong> <strong>Converting Time</strong>: How fast does the converter work? Most text-to-speech converters work almost instantaneously! So, if the one you’re using currently is slow? It might be best to give it a pass over to the next candidate.</p>
<p><strong>●</strong> <strong>Sound Quality</strong>: You should also test out whether or not the sound quality of the converted text to speech is good.</p>
<p><strong>●</strong> <strong>Multi-Language Support</strong>: Since this is all for the sake of increasing accessibility, you should start thinking about how many languages your converter supports as well. You might not be able to use all of them or even want to. But, that extra function can be helpful for the future.</p>
<p><strong>●</strong> <strong>Voice-Control Options</strong>: Does the converter offers you advanced voice controls? Your average converter usually offers speed and voice options, but you might find that a text-to-speech converter with more advanced options (i.e., tone, pitch, etc. controls) may help you get better quality content in the long run.</p>

Specifically, a FREEmium text-to-speech converter that you can use when you’re still on the trying-out stage! This part will include a tutorial and a short introduction:</p>

Most <strong>text-to-human voice converter</strong>s function much the same way. The main difference usually being on the number of features focused and the limitations imposed (for tools with FREEmium services that impose limits on the FREE version, like the tool we’ll be using for our example):</p>
<p><strong>Step 1: Upload Text</strong></p>
<p>First, upload the text that you want to convert into speech!</p>
<p>Most online converters offer a text box that you can use in order to copy &amp; paste the text onto (like in the image below), while others offer an ‘upload’ feature that you can use to upload text from a document.</p>

                ></p>
<p><strong>Step 2: Adjust Voice Reader!</strong></p>
<p>Next, the main thing that you usually have to worry about is the voice options.</p>
<p>Most TTS converters at least offer the opportunity to choose what voice you want the text to be read in. Some, more advanced solutions, may offer voices in other languages, dialects, accents, etc. as well as voice control options (tone, pitch, etc.)</p>

                ></p>
<p><strong>Step 3: Reader Controls!</strong></p>
<p>Outside of voice options, most text-to-speech converters also offer the ability to control the general outcome of the converted text to speech.</p>
<p>More advanced tools will have multiple options on offer for this, but even the most basic ones at least offer a method for controlling the speed at which the text is read by the voice you’ve chosen!</p>

                      alt="Adjust Speech Controls"
                ></p>
<p><strong>Step 4: Convert Text to MP3!</strong></p>
<p>Now is finally the time to <strong>convert text to MP3</strong> format! Some TTS readers will not allow for this without you paying the premium price, but most will at least offer a limited MP3 conversion feature (usually one that limits the length of conversion or the quality).</p>

In this next part, we’ll be focusing on “super tips”</p>
<p>OR, tips that allow you to generally make the most of these <strong>text-to-human voice converters</strong> to the fullest!</p>
<p><strong>Tip 1: Use AI Text-to-Speech!</strong></p>
<p>Our first tip is to encourage you to take full advantage of AI text-to-speech functions. Artificial Intelligence allows the converted text to sound much nicer and much more like it was read by an actual human being — which enables you to create a very professional-sounding project without having to hire a voiceover actor&#x2F;actress.</p>

                      alt="Artificial Intelligence (AI) in Text-to-Speech"
                ></p>
<p><strong>Tip 2: Language and Regions Settings!</strong></p>
<p>If your content is available in multiple languages and you want to convert all of the different editions of said content, you’ll need to find a converter that supports all of those languages. You may also consider looking for regional support as well. For example, for basic English language, most TTS converters usually have “American” voices as well as “British” voices to support different accents despite them using the same text.</p>
<p><img  
                     lazyload
                     src="/images/loading.svg"

                      alt="Language and Regions Settings"
                ></p>
<p><strong>Tip 3: Pick an Appropriate Voice!</strong></p>
<p>The voice you choose to read your text is also very important. Some premium <strong>text-to-human voice converters</strong> offer a great variety to choose from to give you options when it comes to what kind of voice you want to read your content.</p>
<p><img

                      alt="TTS Voices Settings"
                ></p>
<p><strong>Tip 4: Audio Settings!</strong></p>
<p>This is a bit of a rare feature, but some TTS converters will allow you to adjust your audio before it converts your <strong>content from text to speech (MP3)</strong>. Sometimes, this is as simple as allowing you to choose an audio format (as is shown in the image below), other times, it allows you to control the actual sound quality of the finished product.</p>

<p><strong>Tip 5: Adjust Voice Speed!</strong></p>
<p>Earlier, we emphasized the importance of choosing your voice reader carefully! Now, we focus on the subject of speed. Some voices are better when they are slowed down, others are better when sped up. Play around with these settings to see which way is more natural for your chosen voice!</p>

                ></p>
<p><strong>Tip 6: Adjust Voice Pitch</strong></p>
<p>To allow for even more flexibility when it comes to voice style, you’ll find that some TTS converters will allow you to adjust voice pitch! This is a helpful feature for when you’re looking for that particular voice type, as it will allow you to experiment more with the kind of sound you want your content to be known for.</p>

                      alt="Voice Pitch Settings"
                ></p>
<p><strong>Tip 7: Voice Effects Options!</strong></p>
<p>Another advanced feature that you might run into (and should definitely take advantage of), is voice effects! This, again, will allow you to fully customize the type of voice that your content is known for. It’s also great for when you’re aiming for a more natural sound (if you’re patient enough in order to take full advantage of it!)</p>

                ></p>
<p><strong>Tip 8: Use Advanced Video Editing!</strong></p>
<p>Our last tip is not on the subject of using a TTS converter itself, but on the tool, you use in order to create your final project! For that, we recommend <strong><a class="link"   target="_blank" rel="noopener" href="https://tools.techidaily.com/wondershare/filmora/download/" >Wondershare Filmora Video Editor <i class="fa-regular fa-arrow-up-right-from-square fa-sm"></i></a></strong>.</p>

<p>Text-to-Speech is an ingenious accessibility invention that has only grown more and more popular as AI has been thrown in the mix — making the converted speech sound more natural than ever!</p>
<p>As requested, in this article, we’ll be focusing on the subject of <strong>converting text to MP3</strong> format (or, rather, a tangible file that you can use for projects!)</p>

<h2 id="Part-1-What-is-TTS-1"><a href="#Part-1-What-is-TTS-1" class="headerlink" title="Part 1 What is TTS?"></a>Part 1 <strong>What is TTS?</strong></h2><p>What is Text-to-Speech? Text-to-Speech, also called TTS, as previously mentioned, is an accessibility invention. It was developed to help those with vision impairment or blindness — giving them the ability to have text read to them out loud to them (without requiring someone specifically read it out loud for them.</p>
<p>More recent development in TTS technology has allowed it to grow more useful outside of those parameters, however. Especially seeing as it is now possible to convert <strong>text to MP3 with natural voices</strong>.</p>
<h3 id="01Why-Use-Text-to-Speech-Converter-1"><a href="#01Why-Use-Text-to-Speech-Converter-1" class="headerlink" title="01Why Use Text to Speech Converter?"></a>01Why Use Text to Speech Converter?</h3><p><strong>Text-to-Speech human voice converter</strong>s are popular with content creators, and thus, they are the ones who see the most use for them (in the commercial sense). After all, it’s easy enough to convert already created content (in the form of text) into an audio file that there’s no reason not to! Especially since it means that more people would have access to their content!</p>

Getting a live voice actor to <strong>convert text to MP3</strong> for you is very expensive — since you’re paying not only for the voice-actors hours spent but also the use of the expensive equipment that they use for creating voiceovers.</p>
<p>In that regard, even PAID text-to-speech converters are easier on the budget. Making it the perfect solution for content creators who want to increase the accessibility of their content but do not have the time (to create the voiceovers themselves) or the money (to hire someone else to record it).</p>

And, depending on what you’re looking for, you might find yourself longing for extra features later on down the line. That is why, when looking to <strong>convert text to MP3</strong> we recommend considering the following:</p>
<p><strong>●</strong> <strong>Converting Time</strong>: How fast does the converter work? Most text-to-speech converters work almost instantaneously! So, if the one you’re using currently is slow? It might be best to give it a pass over to the next candidate.</p>
<p><strong>●</strong> <strong>Sound Quality</strong>: You should also test out whether or not the sound quality of the converted text to speech is good.</p>
<p><strong>●</strong> <strong>Multi-Language Support</strong>: Since this is all for the sake of increasing accessibility, you should start thinking about how many languages your converter supports as well. You might not be able to use all of them or even want to. But, that extra function can be helpful for the future.</p>
<p><strong>●</strong> <strong>Voice-Control Options</strong>: Does the converter offers you advanced voice controls? Your average converter usually offers speed and voice options, but you might find that a text-to-speech converter with more advanced options (i.e., tone, pitch, etc. controls) may help you get better quality content in the long run.</p>

Specifically, a FREEmium text-to-speech converter that you can use when you’re still on the trying-out stage! This part will include a tutorial and a short introduction:</p>
<h3 id="014-Steps-to-Use-and-Convert-Text-to-Speech-Online-Free-Unlimited-1"><a href="#014-Steps-to-Use-and-Convert-Text-to-Speech-Online-Free-Unlimited-1" class="headerlink" title="014 Steps to Use and Convert Text to Speech Online Free Unlimited?"></a>014 Steps to Use and Convert Text to Speech Online Free Unlimited?</h3><p>First, for the promised tutorial! Most <strong>text-to-human voice converter</strong>s function much the same way. The main difference usually being on the number of features focused and the limitations imposed (for tools with FREEmium services that impose limits on the FREE version, like the tool we’ll be using for our example):</p>
<p><strong>Step 1: Upload Text</strong></p>
<p>First, upload the text that you want to convert into speech!</p>
<p>Most online converters offer a text box that you can use in order to copy &amp; paste the text onto (like in the image below), while others offer an ‘upload’ feature that you can use to upload text from a document.</p>
<p><img  
                     lazyload

                      alt="Upload or Copy &amp; Paste Text"
                ></p>
<p><strong>Step 2: Adjust Voice Reader!</strong></p>
<p>Next, the main thing that you usually have to worry about is the voice options.</p>
<p>Most TTS converters at least offer the opportunity to choose what voice you want the text to be read in. Some, more advanced solutions, may offer voices in other languages, dialects, accents, etc. as well as voice control options (tone, pitch, etc.)</p>
<p><img  
                     lazyload

                      alt="Set Voice Reader"
                ></p>
<p><strong>Step 3: Reader Controls!</strong></p>
<p>Outside of voice options, most text-to-speech converters also offer the ability to control the general outcome of the converted text to speech.</p>
<p>More advanced tools will have multiple options on offer for this, but even the most basic ones at least offer a method for controlling the speed at which the text is read by the voice you’ve chosen!</p>
<p><img  
                     lazyload

                      alt="Adjust Speech Controls"
                ></p>
<p><strong>Step 4: Convert Text to MP3!</strong></p>
<p>Now is finally the time to <strong>convert text to MP3</strong> format! Some TTS readers will not allow for this without you paying the premium price, but most will at least offer a limited MP3 conversion feature (usually one that limits the length of conversion or the quality).</p>

In this next part, we’ll be focusing on “super tips”</p>
<p>OR, tips that allow you to generally make the most of these <strong>text-to-human voice converters</strong> to the fullest!</p>
<p><strong>Tip 1: Use AI Text-to-Speech!</strong></p>
<p>Our first tip is to encourage you to take full advantage of AI text-to-speech functions. Artificial Intelligence allows the converted text to sound much nicer and much more like it was read by an actual human being — which enables you to create a very professional-sounding project without having to hire a voiceover actor&#x2F;actress.</p>
<p><img  
                     lazyload
                     src="/images/loading.svg"

                      alt="Artificial Intelligence (AI) in Text-to-Speech"
                ></p>
<p><strong>Tip 2: Language and Regions Settings!</strong></p>
<p>If your content is available in multiple languages and you want to convert all of the different editions of said content, you’ll need to find a converter that supports all of those languages. You may also consider looking for regional support as well. For example, for basic English language, most TTS converters usually have “American” voices as well as “British” voices to support different accents despite them using the same text.</p>
<p><img  
                     lazyload
                     src="/images/loading.svg"

                      alt="Language and Regions Settings"
                ></p>
<p><strong>Tip 3: Pick an Appropriate Voice!</strong></p>
<p>The voice you choose to read your text is also very important. Some premium <strong>text-to-human voice converters</strong> offer a great variety to choose from to give you options when it comes to what kind of voice you want to read your content.</p>
<p><img

                      alt="TTS Voices Settings"
                ></p>
<p><strong>Tip 4: Audio Settings!</strong></p>
<p>This is a bit of a rare feature, but some TTS converters will allow you to adjust your audio before it converts your <strong>content from text to speech (MP3)</strong>. Sometimes, this is as simple as allowing you to choose an audio format (as is shown in the image below), other times, it allows you to control the actual sound quality of the finished product.</p>
<p><img  
                     lazyload

                      alt="TTS Audio Settings"
                ></p>
<p><strong>Tip 5: Adjust Voice Speed!</strong></p>
<p>Earlier, we emphasized the importance of choosing your voice reader carefully! Now, we focus on the subject of speed. Some voices are better when they are slowed down, others are better when sped up. Play around with these settings to see which way is more natural for your chosen voice!</p>
<p><img  
                     lazyload
                     src="/images/loading.svg"

                      alt="TTS Voice Speed Settings"
                ></p>
<p><strong>Tip 6: Adjust Voice Pitch</strong></p>
<p>To allow for even more flexibility when it comes to voice style, you’ll find that some TTS converters will allow you to adjust voice pitch! This is a helpful feature for when you’re looking for that particular voice type, as it will allow you to experiment more with the kind of sound you want your content to be known for.</p>

                     lazyload

                      alt="Voice Pitch Settings"
                ></p>
<p><strong>Tip 7: Voice Effects Options!</strong></p>
<p>Another advanced feature that you might run into (and should definitely take advantage of), is voice effects! This, again, will allow you to fully customize the type of voice that your content is known for. It’s also great for when you’re aiming for a more natural sound (if you’re patient enough in order to take full advantage of it!)</p>

<p><strong>●</strong> Most of these text-to-speech converters work in much the same way. All you need to do is upload the text you want to convert, adjust the voice and sound settings as needed, and you’re done!</p>
<p><strong>●</strong> Of course, there are some extra little tidbits that you might also want to know in order to enhance your converted text. Our general advice for that is to experiment to the fullest and make sure that you finish everything up with a high-quality video editor like Filmora to ensure that your finished project is as near to perfect as possible!</p>

<p>Text-to-Speech is an ingenious accessibility invention that has only grown more and more popular as AI has been thrown in the mix — making the converted speech sound more natural than ever!</p>
<p>As requested, in this article, we’ll be focusing on the subject of <strong>converting text to MP3</strong> format (or, rather, a tangible file that you can use for projects!)</p>

<h2 id="Part-1-What-is-TTS-2"><a href="#Part-1-What-is-TTS-2" class="headerlink" title="Part 1 What is TTS?"></a>Part 1 <strong>What is TTS?</strong></h2><p>What is Text-to-Speech? Text-to-Speech, also called TTS, as previously mentioned, is an accessibility invention. It was developed to help those with vision impairment or blindness — giving them the ability to have text read to them out loud to them (without requiring someone specifically read it out loud for them.</p>
<p>More recent development in TTS technology has allowed it to grow more useful outside of those parameters, however. Especially seeing as it is now possible to convert <strong>text to MP3 with natural voices</strong>.</p>
<h3 id="01Why-Use-Text-to-Speech-Converter-2"><a href="#01Why-Use-Text-to-Speech-Converter-2" class="headerlink" title="01Why Use Text to Speech Converter?"></a>01Why Use Text to Speech Converter?</h3><p><strong>Text-to-Speech human voice converter</strong>s are popular with content creators, and thus, they are the ones who see the most use for them (in the commercial sense). After all, it’s easy enough to convert already created content (in the form of text) into an audio file that there’s no reason not to! Especially since it means that more people would have access to their content!</p>

Getting a live voice actor to <strong>convert text to MP3</strong> for you is very expensive — since you’re paying not only for the voice-actors hours spent but also the use of the expensive equipment that they use for creating voiceovers.</p>
<p>In that regard, even PAID text-to-speech converters are easier on the budget. Making it the perfect solution for content creators who want to increase the accessibility of their content but do not have the time (to create the voiceovers themselves) or the money (to hire someone else to record it).</p>

And, depending on what you’re looking for, you might find yourself longing for extra features later on down the line. That is why, when looking to <strong>convert text to MP3</strong> we recommend considering the following:</p>
<p><strong>●</strong> <strong>Converting Time</strong>: How fast does the converter work? Most text-to-speech converters work almost instantaneously! So, if the one you’re using currently is slow? It might be best to give it a pass over to the next candidate.</p>
<p><strong>●</strong> <strong>Sound Quality</strong>: You should also test out whether or not the sound quality of the converted text to speech is good.</p>
<p><strong>●</strong> <strong>Multi-Language Support</strong>: Since this is all for the sake of increasing accessibility, you should start thinking about how many languages your converter supports as well. You might not be able to use all of them or even want to. But, that extra function can be helpful for the future.</p>
<p><strong>●</strong> <strong>Voice-Control Options</strong>: Does the converter offers you advanced voice controls? Your average converter usually offers speed and voice options, but you might find that a text-to-speech converter with more advanced options (i.e., tone, pitch, etc. controls) may help you get better quality content in the long run.</p>
<p><img

Specifically, a FREEmium text-to-speech converter that you can use when you’re still on the trying-out stage! This part will include a tutorial and a short introduction:</p>
<h3 id="014-Steps-to-Use-and-Convert-Text-to-Speech-Online-Free-Unlimited-2"><a href="#014-Steps-to-Use-and-Convert-Text-to-Speech-Online-Free-Unlimited-2" class="headerlink" title="014 Steps to Use and Convert Text to Speech Online Free Unlimited?"></a>014 Steps to Use and Convert Text to Speech Online Free Unlimited?</h3><p>First, for the promised tutorial! Most <strong>text-to-human voice converter</strong>s function much the same way. The main difference usually being on the number of features focused and the limitations imposed (for tools with FREEmium services that impose limits on the FREE version, like the tool we’ll be using for our example):</p>
<p><strong>Step 1: Upload Text</strong></p>
<p>First, upload the text that you want to convert into speech!</p>
<p>Most online converters offer a text box that you can use in order to copy &amp; paste the text onto (like in the image below), while others offer an ‘upload’ feature that you can use to upload text from a document.</p>
<p><img  
                     lazyload
                     src="/images/loading.svg"

                      alt="Upload or Copy &amp; Paste Text"
                ></p>
<p><strong>Step 2: Adjust Voice Reader!</strong></p>
<p>Next, the main thing that you usually have to worry about is the voice options.</p>
<p>Most TTS converters at least offer the opportunity to choose what voice you want the text to be read in. Some, more advanced solutions, may offer voices in other languages, dialects, accents, etc. as well as voice control options (tone, pitch, etc.)</p>
<p><img  
                     lazyload

                      alt="Set Voice Reader"
                ></p>
<p><strong>Step 3: Reader Controls!</strong></p>
<p>Outside of voice options, most text-to-speech converters also offer the ability to control the general outcome of the converted text to speech.</p>
<p>More advanced tools will have multiple options on offer for this, but even the most basic ones at least offer a method for controlling the speed at which the text is read by the voice you’ve chosen!</p>
<p><img  
                     lazyload
                     src="/images/loading.svg"

                      alt="Adjust Speech Controls"
                ></p>
<p><strong>Step 4: Convert Text to MP3!</strong></p>
<p>Now is finally the time to <strong>convert text to MP3</strong> format! Some TTS readers will not allow for this without you paying the premium price, but most will at least offer a limited MP3 conversion feature (usually one that limits the length of conversion or the quality).</p>

In this next part, we’ll be focusing on “super tips”</p>
<p>OR, tips that allow you to generally make the most of these <strong>text-to-human voice converters</strong> to the fullest!</p>
<p><strong>Tip 1: Use AI Text-to-Speech!</strong></p>
<p>Our first tip is to encourage you to take full advantage of AI text-to-speech functions. Artificial Intelligence allows the converted text to sound much nicer and much more like it was read by an actual human being — which enables you to create a very professional-sounding project without having to hire a voiceover actor&#x2F;actress.</p>
<p><img  
                     lazyload
                     src="/images/loading.svg"
                     data-src="https://images.wondershare.com/filmora/article-images/2022/01/Super%20Tips%20on%20Converting%20Text%20to%20MP3-9.png"
                      alt="Artificial Intelligence (AI) in Text-to-Speech"
                ></p>
<p><strong>Tip 2: Language and Regions Settings!</strong></p>
<p>If your content is available in multiple languages and you want to convert all of the different editions of said content, you’ll need to find a converter that supports all of those languages. You may also consider looking for regional support as well. For example, for basic English language, most TTS converters usually have “American” voices as well as “British” voices to support different accents despite them using the same text.</p>
<p><img  
                     lazyload
                     src="/images/loading.svg"
                     data-src="https://images.wondershare.com/filmora/article-images/2022/01/Super%20Tips%20on%20Converting%20Text%20to%20MP3-10.png"
                      alt="Language and Regions Settings"
                ></p>
<p><strong>Tip 3: Pick an Appropriate Voice!</strong></p>
<p>The voice you choose to read your text is also very important. Some premium <strong>text-to-human voice converters</strong> offer a great variety to choose from to give you options when it comes to what kind of voice you want to read your content.</p>
<p><img  
                     lazyload
                     src="/images/loading.svg"

                      alt="TTS Voices Settings"
                ></p>
<p><strong>Tip 4: Audio Settings!</strong></p>
<p>This is a bit of a rare feature, but some TTS converters will allow you to adjust your audio before it converts your <strong>content from text to speech (MP3)</strong>. Sometimes, this is as simple as allowing you to choose an audio format (as is shown in the image below), other times, it allows you to control the actual sound quality of the finished product.</p>
<p><img  
                     lazyload
                     src="/images/loading.svg"

                      alt="TTS Audio Settings"
                ></p>
<p><strong>Tip 5: Adjust Voice Speed!</strong></p>
<p>Earlier, we emphasized the importance of choosing your voice reader carefully! Now, we focus on the subject of speed. Some voices are better when they are slowed down, others are better when sped up. Play around with these settings to see which way is more natural for your chosen voice!</p>
<p><img  
                     lazyload
                     src="/images/loading.svg"
                     data-src="https://images.wondershare.com/filmora/article-images/2022/01/Super%20Tips%20on%20Converting%20Text%20to%20MP3-13.png"
                      alt="TTS Voice Speed Settings"
                ></p>
<p><strong>Tip 6: Adjust Voice Pitch</strong></p>
<p>To allow for even more flexibility when it comes to voice style, you’ll find that some TTS converters will allow you to adjust voice pitch! This is a helpful feature for when you’re looking for that particular voice type, as it will allow you to experiment more with the kind of sound you want your content to be known for.</p>
<p><img  
                     lazyload
                     src="/images/loading.svg"

                      alt="Voice Pitch Settings"
                ></p>
<p><strong>Tip 7: Voice Effects Options!</strong></p>
<p>Another advanced feature that you might run into (and should definitely take advantage of), is voice effects! This, again, will allow you to fully customize the type of voice that your content is known for. It’s also great for when you’re aiming for a more natural sound (if you’re patient enough in order to take full advantage of it!)</p>
<p><img  
                     lazyload
                     src="/images/loading.svg"

                      alt="Voice Effects Options"
                ></p>
<p><strong>Tip 8: Use Advanced Video Editing!</strong></p>
<p>Our last tip is not on the subject of using a TTS converter itself, but on the tool, you use in order to create your final project! For that, we recommend <strong><a class="link"   target="_blank" rel="noopener" href="https://tools.techidaily.com/wondershare/filmora/download/" >Wondershare Filmora Video Editor <i class="fa-regular fa-arrow-up-right-from-square fa-sm"></i></a></strong>.</p>

<p>Text-to-Speech is an ingenious accessibility invention that has only grown more and more popular as AI has been thrown in the mix — making the converted speech sound more natural than ever!</p>
<p>As requested, in this article, we’ll be focusing on the subject of <strong>converting text to MP3</strong> format (or, rather, a tangible file that you can use for projects!)</p>

<h2 id="Part-1-What-is-TTS-3"><a href="#Part-1-What-is-TTS-3" class="headerlink" title="Part 1 What is TTS?"></a>Part 1 <strong>What is TTS?</strong></h2><p>What is Text-to-Speech? Text-to-Speech, also called TTS, as previously mentioned, is an accessibility invention. It was developed to help those with vision impairment or blindness — giving them the ability to have text read to them out loud to them (without requiring someone specifically read it out loud for them.</p>
<p>More recent development in TTS technology has allowed it to grow more useful outside of those parameters, however. Especially seeing as it is now possible to convert <strong>text to MP3 with natural voices</strong>.</p>
<h3 id="01Why-Use-Text-to-Speech-Converter-3"><a href="#01Why-Use-Text-to-Speech-Converter-3" class="headerlink" title="01Why Use Text to Speech Converter?"></a>01Why Use Text to Speech Converter?</h3><p><strong>Text-to-Speech human voice converter</strong>s are popular with content creators, and thus, they are the ones who see the most use for them (in the commercial sense). After all, it’s easy enough to convert already created content (in the form of text) into an audio file that there’s no reason not to! Especially since it means that more people would have access to their content!</p>

Getting a live voice actor to <strong>convert text to MP3</strong> for you is very expensive — since you’re paying not only for the voice-actors hours spent but also the use of the expensive equipment that they use for creating voiceovers.</p>
<p>In that regard, even PAID text-to-speech converters are easier on the budget. Making it the perfect solution for content creators who want to increase the accessibility of their content but do not have the time (to create the voiceovers themselves) or the money (to hire someone else to record it).</p>

And, depending on what you’re looking for, you might find yourself longing for extra features later on down the line. That is why, when looking to <strong>convert text to MP3</strong> we recommend considering the following:</p>
<p><strong>●</strong> <strong>Converting Time</strong>: How fast does the converter work? Most text-to-speech converters work almost instantaneously! So, if the one you’re using currently is slow? It might be best to give it a pass over to the next candidate.</p>
<p><strong>●</strong> <strong>Sound Quality</strong>: You should also test out whether or not the sound quality of the converted text to speech is good.</p>
<p><strong>●</strong> <strong>Multi-Language Support</strong>: Since this is all for the sake of increasing accessibility, you should start thinking about how many languages your converter supports as well. You might not be able to use all of them or even want to. But, that extra function can be helpful for the future.</p>
<p><strong>●</strong> <strong>Voice-Control Options</strong>: Does the converter offers you advanced voice controls? Your average converter usually offers speed and voice options, but you might find that a text-to-speech converter with more advanced options (i.e., tone, pitch, etc. controls) may help you get better quality content in the long run.</p>
<p><img

Specifically, a FREEmium text-to-speech converter that you can use when you’re still on the trying-out stage! This part will include a tutorial and a short introduction:</p>
<h3 id="014-Steps-to-Use-and-Convert-Text-to-Speech-Online-Free-Unlimited-3"><a href="#014-Steps-to-Use-and-Convert-Text-to-Speech-Online-Free-Unlimited-3" class="headerlink" title="014 Steps to Use and Convert Text to Speech Online Free Unlimited?"></a>014 Steps to Use and Convert Text to Speech Online Free Unlimited?</h3><p>First, for the promised tutorial! Most <strong>text-to-human voice converter</strong>s function much the same way. The main difference usually being on the number of features focused and the limitations imposed (for tools with FREEmium services that impose limits on the FREE version, like the tool we’ll be using for our example):</p>
<p><strong>Step 1: Upload Text</strong></p>
<p>First, upload the text that you want to convert into speech!</p>
<p>Most online converters offer a text box that you can use in order to copy &amp; paste the text onto (like in the image below), while others offer an ‘upload’ feature that you can use to upload text from a document.</p>
<p><img  
                     lazyload
                     src="/images/loading.svg"

                      alt="Upload or Copy &amp; Paste Text"
                ></p>
<p><strong>Step 2: Adjust Voice Reader!</strong></p>
<p>Next, the main thing that you usually have to worry about is the voice options.</p>
<p>Most TTS converters at least offer the opportunity to choose what voice you want the text to be read in. Some, more advanced solutions, may offer voices in other languages, dialects, accents, etc. as well as voice control options (tone, pitch, etc.)</p>
<p><img  
                     lazyload
                     src="/images/loading.svg"

                      alt="Set Voice Reader"
                ></p>
<p><strong>Step 3: Reader Controls!</strong></p>
<p>Outside of voice options, most text-to-speech converters also offer the ability to control the general outcome of the converted text to speech.</p>
<p>More advanced tools will have multiple options on offer for this, but even the most basic ones at least offer a method for controlling the speed at which the text is read by the voice you’ve chosen!</p>
<p><img  
                     lazyload
                     src="/images/loading.svg"

                      alt="Adjust Speech Controls"
                ></p>
<p><strong>Step 4: Convert Text to MP3!</strong></p>
<p>Now is finally the time to <strong>convert text to MP3</strong> format! Some TTS readers will not allow for this without you paying the premium price, but most will at least offer a limited MP3 conversion feature (usually one that limits the length of conversion or the quality).</p>

In this next part, we’ll be focusing on “super tips”</p>
<p>OR, tips that allow you to generally make the most of these <strong>text-to-human voice converters</strong> to the fullest!</p>
<p><strong>Tip 1: Use AI Text-to-Speech!</strong></p>
<p>Our first tip is to encourage you to take full advantage of AI text-to-speech functions. Artificial Intelligence allows the converted text to sound much nicer and much more like it was read by an actual human being — which enables you to create a very professional-sounding project without having to hire a voiceover actor&#x2F;actress.</p>
<p><img  
                     lazyload
                     src="/images/loading.svg"
                     data-src="https://images.wondershare.com/filmora/article-images/2022/01/Super%20Tips%20on%20Converting%20Text%20to%20MP3-9.png"
                      alt="Artificial Intelligence (AI) in Text-to-Speech"
                ></p>
<p><strong>Tip 2: Language and Regions Settings!</strong></p>
<p>If your content is available in multiple languages and you want to convert all of the different editions of said content, you’ll need to find a converter that supports all of those languages. You may also consider looking for regional support as well. For example, for basic English language, most TTS converters usually have “American” voices as well as “British” voices to support different accents despite them using the same text.</p>
<p><img  
                     lazyload
                     src="/images/loading.svg"
                     data-src="https://images.wondershare.com/filmora/article-images/2022/01/Super%20Tips%20on%20Converting%20Text%20to%20MP3-10.png"
                      alt="Language and Regions Settings"
                ></p>
<p><strong>Tip 3: Pick an Appropriate Voice!</strong></p>
<p>The voice you choose to read your text is also very important. Some premium <strong>text-to-human voice converters</strong> offer a great variety to choose from to give you options when it comes to what kind of voice you want to read your content.</p>
<p><img  
                     lazyload
                     src="/images/loading.svg"
                     data-src="https://images.wondershare.com/filmora/article-images/2022/01/Super%20Tips%20on%20Converting%20Text%20to%20MP3-11.png"
                      alt="TTS Voices Settings"
                ></p>
<p><strong>Tip 4: Audio Settings!</strong></p>
<p>This is a bit of a rare feature, but some TTS converters will allow you to adjust your audio before it converts your <strong>content from text to speech (MP3)</strong>. Sometimes, this is as simple as allowing you to choose an audio format (as is shown in the image below), other times, it allows you to control the actual sound quality of the finished product.</p>
<p><img  
                     lazyload
                     src="/images/loading.svg"

                      alt="TTS Audio Settings"
                ></p>
<p><strong>Tip 5: Adjust Voice Speed!</strong></p>
<p>Earlier, we emphasized the importance of choosing your voice reader carefully! Now, we focus on the subject of speed. Some voices are better when they are slowed down, others are better when sped up. Play around with these settings to see which way is more natural for your chosen voice!</p>
<p><img  
                     lazyload
                     src="/images/loading.svg"
                     data-src="https://images.wondershare.com/filmora/article-images/2022/01/Super%20Tips%20on%20Converting%20Text%20to%20MP3-13.png"
                      alt="TTS Voice Speed Settings"
                ></p>
<p><strong>Tip 6: Adjust Voice Pitch</strong></p>
<p>To allow for even more flexibility when it comes to voice style, you’ll find that some TTS converters will allow you to adjust voice pitch! This is a helpful feature for when you’re looking for that particular voice type, as it will allow you to experiment more with the kind of sound you want your content to be known for.</p>
<p><img  
                     lazyload
                     src="/images/loading.svg"
                     data-src="https://images.wondershare.com/filmora/article-images/2022/01/Super%20Tips%20on%20Converting%20Text%20to%20MP3-14.png"
                      alt="Voice Pitch Settings"
                ></p>
<p><strong>Tip 7: Voice Effects Options!</strong></p>
<p>Another advanced feature that you might run into (and should definitely take advantage of), is voice effects! This, again, will allow you to fully customize the type of voice that your content is known for. It’s also great for when you’re aiming for a more natural sound (if you’re patient enough in order to take full advantage of it!)</p>
<p><img  
                     lazyload
                     src="/images/loading.svg"

                      alt="Voice Effects Options"
                ></p>
<p><strong>Tip 8: Use Advanced Video Editing!</strong></p>
<p>Our last tip is not on the subject of using a TTS converter itself, but on the tool, you use in order to create your final project! For that, we recommend <strong><a class="link"   target="_blank" rel="noopener" href="https://tools.techidaily.com/wondershare/filmora/download/" >Wondershare Filmora Video Editor <i class="fa-regular fa-arrow-up-right-from-square fa-sm"></i></a></strong>.</p>
