<p>If you’re looking, specifically, for a clean method of doing so, then it’s understandable if you’re facing difficulty with finding the right one. There are many <strong>speech-to-text</strong> audio converters available.</p>
<p>However, not all of them are all that great in quality. In this article, we’ll be introducing a couple of converters that you can use to change <strong>audio to text</strong> as well as show you how to do it</p>

The quick answer? Yes</p>
<p>Transcribe (shown in the image below), which is available for all iOS devices, is one such app. This tool, as you might be able to guess from the name, is able to transcribe spoken audio into text. It’s especially useful for creating notes (personal use), as it means you can have your thoughts written down in an instant without ever having to lift up a pen or type it down for yourself.</p>
<p>And, just to be very clear, there are many more <strong>speech-to-text</strong> apps like this one</p>

From apps, software, online solutions, etc. There are plenty of ways, so you can find the one that works best for you</p>
<h3 id="01Online-Speech-to-Text-—-VEED-IO"><a href="#01Online-Speech-to-Text-—-VEED-IO" class="headerlink" title="01Online Speech-to-Text — VEED.IO"></a>01Online Speech-to-Text — VEED.IO</h3><p>The first and most common way to turn <strong>speech-to-text</strong>—especially for those who want something more accessible no matter what device they are on—is online <strong>speech-to-text MP3</strong> converters A great example of one of these online tools is the MP3 to text converter, VEED-IO. The key feature here is that you won’t have to download or install anything to start using it Also, VEED.IO (and many other online <strong>speech-to-text</strong> converters) is FREE.</p>

<h3 id="02Windows-Dictate"><a href="#02Windows-Dictate" class="headerlink" title="02Windows Dictate"></a>02Windows Dictate</h3><p>This next one is more of a live <strong>audio-to-text</strong> tool. Or rather, a live transcriber tool, but it can be useful despite the fact, especially since, once again, it is 100% free and FREE to use. What we’re talking about, in this case, is Windows Dictate. This is a built-in function for Windows OS users. It’s there to increase accessibility for those with vision impairment, but it’s also a great way of easily converting your <strong>speech to text</strong>.</p>

<h3 id="03Smart-Phone-App-Transcribe"><a href="#03Smart-Phone-App-Transcribe" class="headerlink" title="03Smart Phone App - Transcribe"></a>03Smart Phone App - Transcribe</h3><p>As mentioned earlier, there are apps out there that work in pretty much the same way. Another notable one, besides the app ‘Transcribe’ that we introduced earlier, is the iOS app called ‘Voice to Text Pro - Transcribe.’ This particular app offers advanced <strong>speech-to-text</strong> functionalities that will allow you to either transcribe live audio or upload an MP3 to transcribe. It also has support for over 150+ languages and has a convenient notes function for taking advantage of the transcription function.</p>

<h3 id="04Google-Docs"><a href="#04Google-Docs" class="headerlink" title="04Google Docs"></a>04Google Docs</h3><p>Another 100% FREE method of getting live <strong>speech</strong> <strong>to text</strong> is Google Doc’s “Voice Typing” function. You can turn this on at any time by making use of the command ‘Ctrl+Shift+S’ or by turning it on manually from the ‘Tools’ tab on a Google Document (shown in the image below). It’s a very easy way of getting your thoughts onto paper while working on other things.</p>

But, don’t worry, Windows Dictates has a Mac&#x2F;iOS counterpart It’s in the form of Apple Dictation Again, it was set up to increase accessibility for users with visual impairment, but it can be pretty useful as well for the times when your hands are too busy to actively type your thoughts down.</p>
<p>You can turn on this feature by going to your device’s ‘Accessibility’ settings and enabling ‘Voice Control’ (as is shown in the image below). It will need to be downloaded and installed onto your device, but it should begin working pretty quickly after that.</p>

<h3 id="03Dragon-Anywhere"><a href="#03Dragon-Anywhere" class="headerlink" title="03Dragon Anywhere"></a>03Dragon Anywhere</h3><p>When people talk about advanced transcription methods, the first one to come is usually “Dragon Anywhere.” Again, much like Watson, this is a business solution that is often found in more professional settings. Also, it comes in a software version (for desktops and laptops) and an app version (for tablets and smart devices).

It is a FREEmium software as well as a more of a business solution. But that only means that you have access to more advanced features.</p>

<p>If you’re looking, specifically, for a clean method of doing so, then it’s understandable if you’re facing difficulty with finding the right one. There are many <strong>speech-to-text</strong> audio converters available.</p>

The quick answer? Yes</p>
<p>Transcribe (shown in the image below), which is available for all iOS devices, is one such app. This tool, as you might be able to guess from the name, is able to transcribe spoken audio into text. It’s especially useful for creating notes (personal use), as it means you can have your thoughts written down in an instant without ever having to lift up a pen or type it down for yourself.</p>

<h3 id="02Windows-Dictate-1"><a href="#02Windows-Dictate-1" class="headerlink" title="02Windows Dictate"></a>02Windows Dictate</h3><p>This next one is more of a live <strong>audio-to-text</strong> tool. Or rather, a live transcriber tool, but it can be useful despite the fact, especially since, once again, it is 100% free and FREE to use. What we’re talking about, in this case, is Windows Dictate. This is a built-in function for Windows OS users. It’s there to increase accessibility for those with vision impairment, but it’s also a great way of easily converting your <strong>speech to text</strong>.</p>

Another notable one, besides the app ‘Transcribe’ that we introduced earlier, is the iOS app called ‘Voice to Text Pro - Transcribe.’ This particular app offers advanced <strong>speech-to-text</strong> functionalities that will allow you to either transcribe live audio or upload an MP3 to transcribe. It also has support for over 150+ languages and has a convenient notes function for taking advantage of the transcription function.</p>

You can turn this on at any time by making use of the command ‘Ctrl+Shift+S’ or by turning it on manually from the ‘Tools’ tab on a Google Document (shown in the image below). It’s a very easy way of getting your thoughts onto paper while working on other things.</p>

But, don’t worry, Windows Dictates has a Mac&#x2F;iOS counterpart It’s in the form of Apple Dictation Again, it was set up to increase accessibility for users with visual impairment, but it can be pretty useful as well for the times when your hands are too busy to actively type your thoughts down.</p>
<p>You can turn on this feature by going to your device’s ‘Accessibility’ settings and enabling ‘Voice Control’ (as is shown in the image below). It will need to be downloaded and installed onto your device, but it should begin working pretty quickly after that.</p>

                ></p>
<p>Step 5: From here you can copy any file and then save it to another folder to watch or share later on.</p>

<p><strong>Step 1:</strong> Once you open the Video Stabilizer option, you will be asked to either upload the video you’d like to stabilize from the hard drive on your computer or paste the video’s URL if the clip you want to stabilize is stored online. Hit the Upload Video button after you perform either of these actions and wait for the upload process to be finalized.</p>
<p><strong>Step 2:</strong> To initiate the video stabilization process, you just have to click on the Stabilize button. The process will start automatically and its duration depends on the size of the file you’re stabilizing.</p>
<p><strong>Step 3:</strong> Once the process is complete your video will appear in the Stabilized Video box, where you can preview it before downloading it as an MP4 file to your computer. You must click on the Save icon below the video to start the downloading the video.</p>

<p>To make things even better, the platform supports all common file formats such as MOV or MP4, so you don’t have to waste time trying to change the video’s file format before you start the video stabilization process.</p>
<p><strong>Step 1:</strong> Upon arriving at video-stabilize.com, you can simply drag and drop the video file to the designated box. Alternatively, you can click on the Upload your movie button or you can upload the video using Dropbox, OneDrive or Google Drive. Simply select the file you want to stabilize and the upload process will begin automatically.</p>
<p><strong>Step 2:</strong> The size of the video clip and the speed of your Internet connection determines how long the upload is going to last. Once your video is uploaded you should simply click on the Transform Video to start the process of stabilizing your video.

<p>The only downside is that the platform doesn’t allow you to download a video you stabilized directly to your computer, although you can use the video’s URL to share it with your friends online.</p>
<p><strong>Step 1:</strong> Head over to your YouTube channel and upload a video by clicking on the Camera icon in the upper right corner of the screen. Before the upload starts you can change the Privacy settings from Public to Private so your video won’t be visible to other YouTube users.</p>
<p><strong>Step 2:</strong> After the video is uploaded to your channel, open the Creator Studio and click on the Video Manager option. This action will enable you to see the video you’ve just uploaded. Click on the Edit button that is located below the video and proceed to open the Enhancements tab in the YouTube’s video editor.</p>
<p><strong>Step 3:</strong> In the Enhancements tab, you’ll be able to see the Stabilize icon. Click on it to start the video stabilization process, and once the process is complete, you can copy the video’s URL and share it on social media or send it to your friends.</p>
