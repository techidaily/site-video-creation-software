"I need to convert some general audio files to AIFF, do you have any recommendations?"

We do, in fact, have some recommendations for you! The AIFF file format, while generally obscure, is accepted by most general audio converters! So, we didn't have any problem finding some that you can use to **AIFF converter**!

#### In this article

01 [What's So Good About AIFF?](#Part 1)

02 [How to Convert M4A to AIFF Free and Easily](#Part 2)

03 [What Makes AIFF Converter the Best Free Online Tool for Mac Users?](#Part 3)

## Part 1 **What's So Good About AIFF?**

But okay, what's the deal with AIFF? Is it really all that good? And, if it is, why? For the first part of this article, we've prepared a short overview on the AIFF file format You can skip ahead though if you'd prefer to see the tutorial on **AIFF Converters** or our list of recommendations.

### 01**What's AIFF?**

AIFF, also called the Audio Interchange File Format, is an audio file format that was popularized in 1988\. It was based on the Electronic Arts Interchange File Format and is probably most familiar for Mac users. It's accepted by most media players, including Apple Music and the Apple QuickTime Player.

### 02**Why Is It So Popular?**

Why? Well, it all has to do with the loss of quality. AIFF files are notable because they are uncompressed — leading to an inarguably better sound. That makes it popular with content creators, who want to provide the best possible listening experience to their audience. The caveat to this, of course, is that its uncompressed state means that it takes up a lot more space on one's disk drive. But, many people would be willing to give that up in exchange for the enhanced sound.

## Part 2 **How to Convert M4A to AIFF Free and Easily**

For this next section, we'll be teaching you how to **convert M4A to AIFF** with an online **AIFF converter**. The benefit of using an online converter like the one we'll be showing you how to use is that it is usually FREE and very efficient. This makes it a perfect solution for those who are just looking to convert to or from AIFF occasionally and thus has no need for a more permanent solution.

### 01**Step 1: Launch Online AIFF Converter & Upload Files**

The first thing that you have to do is open up the online **AIFF Converter** that you want to use. For our example, we've chosen FreeConvert, but there are plenty of other ones out there for you to choose from

Once you're on-site, make use of the upload options to prepare your file to be converted. In this case, we uploaded an MP3 file, but it will work for M4A to AIFF just as well (along with other file formats.)

****2\. ConvertOnMac**

Our next recommended tool is Convert on Mac This is another online tool that can be used to convert a variety of files (i.e., audio, video, image, document, etc). The one that we'll be focusing on though is Convert on Mac's **AIFF Converter**

| Highlights                                                                                                                                                          | Highlights                                                                                                              |

****3\. Online Converter**

The next one up is Online Converter This one is more like ZAMZAR than Convert on Mac. If only because it also comes with a max file size that is locked. It's more limited though — in that it doesn't support as many input and output formats. And, as you can no doubt guess from the interface, quite old-school as well.

****5\. EaseUS Video Converter**

With 'EaseUS Video Converter' we continue on our trend of AIFF conversion software This one, despite its name suggesting otherwise, functions as a solid Audio Converter So far, it's closest to Filmora Pro when compared to all the others on this list. It's a one-trick kind of pony though. Seeing as, unlike with Filmora, you can really only use this to convert files.

****6\. Wondershare UniConverter**

This next software, the 'Wondershare UniConverter' is a bit of a mix between Filmora and EaseUS Video Converter.

This is a hidden feature that not many people know about, but iTunes actually works as a pretty serviceable **AIFF Converter**. It's not the most efficient, but with iTunes' AIFF Encoder, conversion to AIFF is possible (converting from AIFF to MP3, and WAV is also possible because iTunes provides Encoders for those as well).

"I need to convert some general audio files to AIFF, do you have any recommendations?"

We do, in fact, have some recommendations for you! The AIFF file format, while generally obscure, is accepted by most general audio converters! So, we didn't have any problem finding some that you can use to **AIFF converter**!

#### In this article

01 [What's So Good About AIFF?](#Part 1)

02 [How to Convert M4A to AIFF Free and Easily](#Part 2)

03 [What Makes AIFF Converter the Best Free Online Tool for Mac Users?](#Part 3)

## Part 1 **What's So Good About AIFF?**

But okay, what's the deal with AIFF? Is it really all that good? And, if it is, why? For the first part of this article, we've prepared a short overview on the AIFF file format You can skip ahead though if you'd prefer to see the tutorial on **AIFF Converters** or our list of recommendations.

### 01**What's AIFF?**

AIFF, also called the Audio Interchange File Format, is an audio file format that was popularized in 1988\. It was based on the Electronic Arts Interchange File Format and is probably most familiar for Mac users. It's accepted by most media players, including Apple Music and the Apple QuickTime Player.

### 02**Why Is It So Popular?**

Why? Well, it all has to do with the loss of quality. AIFF files are notable because they are uncompressed — leading to an inarguably better sound. That makes it popular with content creators, who want to provide the best possible listening experience to their audience. The caveat to this, of course, is that its uncompressed state means that it takes up a lot more space on one's disk drive. But, many people would be willing to give that up in exchange for the enhanced sound.

## Part 2 **How to Convert M4A to AIFF Free and Easily**

For this next section, we'll be teaching you how to **convert M4A to AIFF** with an online **AIFF converter**. The benefit of using an online converter like the one we'll be showing you how to use is that it is usually FREE and very efficient.

"I need to convert some general audio files to AIFF, do you have any recommendations?"

We do, in fact, have some recommendations for you! The AIFF file format, while generally obscure, is accepted by most general audio converters! So, we didn't have any problem finding some that you can use to **AIFF converter**!

#### In this article

01 [What's So Good About AIFF?](#Part 1)

02 [How to Convert M4A to AIFF Free and Easily](#Part 2)

03 [What Makes AIFF Converter the Best Free Online Tool for Mac Users?](#Part 3)

## Part 1 **What's So Good About AIFF?**

But okay, what's the deal with AIFF? Is it really all that good? And, if it is, why? For the first part of this article, we've prepared a short overview on the AIFF file format You can skip ahead though if you'd prefer to see the tutorial on **AIFF Converters** or our list of recommendations.

### 01**What's AIFF?**

AIFF, also called the Audio Interchange File Format, is an audio file format that was popularized in 1988\. It was based on the Electronic Arts Interchange File Format and is probably most familiar for Mac users. It's accepted by most media players, including Apple Music and the Apple QuickTime Player.

### 02**Why Is It So Popular?**

Why? Well, it all has to do with the loss of quality. AIFF files are notable because they are uncompressed — leading to an inarguably better sound. That makes it popular with content creators, who want to provide the best possible listening experience to their audience. The caveat to this, of course, is that its uncompressed state means that it takes up a lot more space on one's disk drive. But, many people would be willing to give that up in exchange for the enhanced sound.

## Part 2 **How to Convert M4A to AIFF Free and Easily**

For this next section, we'll be teaching you how to **convert M4A to AIFF** with an online **AIFF converter**. The benefit of using an online converter like the one we'll be showing you how to use is that it is usually FREE and very efficient.

****2\. ConvertOnMac**

Our next recommended tool is Convert on Mac This is another online tool that can be used to convert a variety of files (i.e., audio, video, image, document, etc). The one that we'll be focusing on though is Convert on Mac's **AIFF Converter**

| Highlights                                                                                                                                                          | Highlights                                                                                                              |

****3\. Online Converter**

The next one up is Online Converter This one is more like ZAMZAR than Convert on Mac. If only because it also comes with a max file size that is locked. It's more limited though — in that it doesn't support as many input and output formats. And, as you can no doubt guess from the interface, quite old-school as well.

| Highlights                                                                                               | Highlights                                                                                      |

****4\. [Wondershare Filmora Video Editor](https://tools.techidaily.com/wondershare/filmora/download/)**

For this next **AIFF Converter**, we make a complete departure from your general converters by introducing a completely different beast altogether Specifically, in the form of a Video Editor called Filmora.

****5\. EaseUS Video Converter**

With 'EaseUS Video Converter' we continue on our trend of AIFF conversion software This one, despite its name suggesting otherwise, functions as a solid Audio Converter So far, it's closest to Filmora Pro when compared to all the others on this list. It's a one-trick kind of pony though. Seeing as, unlike with Filmora, you can really only use this to convert files.

****6\. Wondershare UniConverter**

This next software, the 'Wondershare UniConverter' is a bit of a mix between Filmora and EaseUS Video Converter. As is evident from the UI (shown-off in the screenshot provided), it has the makings of a straightforward converter but with extra tools (i.e., video editor, video compressor, merger, screen recorder, etc.) that you can take advantage of while working on your conversions.

01 [What's So Good About AIFF?](#Part 1)

02 [How to Convert M4A to AIFF Free and Easily](#Part 2)

03 [What Makes AIFF Converter the Best Free Online Tool for Mac Users?](#Part 3)

## Part 1 **What's So Good About AIFF?**

But okay, what's the deal with AIFF? Is it really all that good? And, if it is, why? For the first part of this article, we've prepared a short overview on the AIFF file format You can skip ahead though if you'd prefer to see the tutorial on **AIFF Converters** or our list of recommendations.

### 01**What's AIFF?**

AIFF, also called the Audio Interchange File Format, is an audio file format that was popularized in 1988\. It was based on the Electronic Arts Interchange File Format and is probably most familiar for Mac users. It's accepted by most media players, including Apple Music and the Apple QuickTime Player.

### 02**Why Is It So Popular?**

Why? Well, it all has to do with the loss of quality. AIFF files are notable because they are uncompressed — leading to an inarguably better sound. That makes it popular with content creators, who want to provide the best possible listening experience to their audience. The caveat to this, of course, is that its uncompressed state means that it takes up a lot more space on one's disk drive. But, many people would be willing to give that up in exchange for the enhanced sound.

## Part 2 **How to Convert M4A to AIFF Free and Easily**

For this next section, we'll be teaching you how to **convert M4A to AIFF** with an online **AIFF converter**.

****2\. ConvertOnMac**

Our next recommended tool is Convert on Mac This is another online tool that can be used to convert a variety of files (i.e., audio, video, image, document, etc). The one that we'll be focusing on though is Convert on Mac's **AIFF Converter**

| Highlights                                                                                                                                                          | Highlights                                                                                                              |

****3\. Online Converter**

The next one up is Online Converter This one is more like ZAMZAR than Convert on Mac. If only because it also comes with a max file size that is locked. It's more limited though — in that it doesn't support as many input and output formats. And, as you can no doubt guess from the interface, quite old-school as well.

| Highlights                                                                                               | Highlights                                                                                      |

****4\. [Wondershare Filmora Video Editor](https://tools.techidaily.com/wondershare/filmora/download/)**

For this next **AIFF Converter**, we make a complete departure from your general converters by introducing a completely different beast altogether Specifically, in the form of a Video Editor called Filmora. Filmora is an incredibly advanced video editing tool. And, because of this, it's capable of most things related to video and audio editing. Including, in this case, AIFF conversion

| Highlights                                                                                                                                                     | Highlights                                                                                                                                  |

****5\. EaseUS Video Converter**

With 'EaseUS Video Converter' we continue on our trend of AIFF conversion software This one, despite its name suggesting otherwise, functions as a solid Audio Converter So far, it's closest to Filmora Pro when compared to all the others on this list. It's a one-trick kind of pony though. Seeing as, unlike with Filmora, you can really only use this to convert files.

| Highlights                                                                                                   | Highlights                                                                                    |

****6\. Wondershare UniConverter**

This next software, the 'Wondershare UniConverter' is a bit of a mix between Filmora and EaseUS Video Converter. As is evident from the UI (shown-off in the screenshot provided), it has the makings of a straightforward converter but with extra tools (i.e., video editor, video compressor, merger, screen recorder, etc.) that you can take advantage of while working on your conversions.

| Highlights                                                                                                    | Highlights                                                                                                                         |

****7\. VSDC Free Audio Converter**

Next up, we have VSDC VSDC is a FREE Audio Converter. It's pretty old-school (as is perhaps evident from the UI example) but it supports a variety of audio formats, including AIFF, which earned it a spot on this list of ours

| Highlights                                                                                                            | Highlights                                                                                      |

****8\. Switch Audio File Converter**

Switch Audio File Converter is a Mac AIFF Converter. You can find it on the Mac APP Store, or purchase it directly on the NCH Software website. For the FREE app version, you have access to certain functions, with the rest being locked under in-app purchases.

****9\. iTunes - Apple**

This is a hidden feature that not many people know about, but iTunes actually works as a pretty serviceable **AIFF Converter**. It's not the most efficient, but with iTunes' AIFF Encoder, conversion to AIFF is possible (converting from AIFF to MP3, and WAV is also possible because iTunes provides Encoders for those as well).

| Highlights                                                                                                              | Highlights                                                                                                                     |

****10\. Convertio**

Last, but not least, is Convertio We circle back with this fourth and last online converter It's actually quite advanced. Although, just like many of the other FREEmium online converters we've listed, it's not 100% FREE and comes with a lot of limitations.

| Highlights                                                                               | Highlights                                                                            |
