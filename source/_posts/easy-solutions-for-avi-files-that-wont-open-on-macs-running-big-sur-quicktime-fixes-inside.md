**#01\. Reasons Why You Can't Play AVI on Mac/QuickTime?**

Before you fix AVI file won't play on Mac issue, you'd better know something about AVI. Widely used in the area of multimedia storage like DV, camcorder, film post-production, broadcast wave, etc, AVI (Audio Video Interleave) is a multimedia container format containing both video and audio data in a file container that allows synchronous audio-with-video playback. AVI is not a specific type of file and there are various codecs for AVI videos including MPEG-4, MPEG-3, MPEG-1, MPEG-H, MPEG-HD, Xvid, DivX, Cinepak, Indeo, DV, MJPEG, etc. So, many so-called [AVI players](https://tools.techidaily.com/5kplayer/video-music-player/) for Mac like QuickTime can't play AVI on Mac as they can't support all types of AVI files. 

**#02\. Common AVI File Won't Play on Mac/QuickTime Problems List.**

1\. When the default AVI player Mac QuickTime (10) won't play AVI on Mac, there is often a message showing: _"The document 'filename.avi' could not be opened. The movie is not in a format that QuickTime Player understands."_ Followed with _"You may need to install additional software to open this type of file."_  
 2\. Some users said that QuickTime won't play AVI files on Mac (MacBook/MacBook Air/MacBook Pro/iMac etc.) after updating to new Mac OS like Catalina, Mojave, High Seirra.  
 3\. Sometimes, video gets struck, but sound keeps playing, or vice versa. From AVI wikipedia, audio and video are individually stored in AVI file. Generally, audio and video are well-synchronized, but desynchronization of audio and video may happen when playing AVI on Mac in some certain [AVI media player](https://tools.techidaily.com/5kplayer/video-music-player/) software.
