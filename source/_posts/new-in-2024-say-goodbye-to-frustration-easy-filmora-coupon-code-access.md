Blu-ray Editor lets you edit your videos by applying various effects and adding descriptions, audio, video, and images.

## **Video sharing:**

 Your video can be saved on the computer, burned on a DVD / Blu-ray disc, adjusted for mobile devices (iOS, Android), or shared on social networks (Facebook, Youtube).

## Final Verdict About AVS Video Editor

The software is very easy to use and includes a complete library of effects, transitions, menus, and subtitle elements that can be customized to suit any user's needs. It is complete and very appealing for beginners just getting started with video editing as it allows you to burn to DVD or Blu-ray and post directly on social media.

## Our Recommendation

While it is a great tool for beginners, it is outdated and behind modern-day video editors if you compare it with them. As a result, you need a video editor with plenty of powerful features and one that is competitive with the marketplace today. We recommended using our Filmora X video editor. Now it is user-friendly but also suitable for beginners. It contains all the features you need today to put life in your videos. It's free to try for as long as you want, which is the main advantage here. So what are you waiting for? Try it out today, and you'll enjoy editing videos.
