The majority of individuals favor OIS over EIS. A hardware approach is always preferable to a software platform since EIS is essentially a repair solution that causes picture resolution deterioration by cutting it and estimating what this would seem like if it were steady. OIS also performs better in low-light conditions. The best video stabilizer app for android is the one that incorporates both approaches.

02 [Best Free Video Stabilizer Apps for Android](#part2)

## Part 1: What Is the Difference Between OIS and EIS?

The majority of individuals favor OIS over EIS. A hardware approach is always preferable to a software platform since EIS is essentially a repair solution that causes picture resolution deterioration by cutting it and estimating what this would seem like if it were steady. OIS also performs better in low-light conditions. The best video stabilizer app for android is the one that incorporates both approaches.

Moreover, OIS and EIS both hold a significant reputation for video stabilization. And not much, but some people prefer Electronic Image Stabilization (EIS) to stabilize their video as it converts the optical signal to a digital one. You will get a better understanding of both the stabilization technologies after reading what's written below:

**Electronic Image Stabilization (EIS)**

Electronic image stabilization operates on a fundamentally different premise, with the problem being tackled at the coding layer after the visible light has been transformed to a digital signal.

**Optical Image Stabilization (OIS)**

The picture is stabilized with this approach by altering the optical path of the detector. Because this is real-time correction, no image change or degradation occurs. The lens component is rotated such that it is parallel to the picture plane.

## Bonus! Remove watermark from your videos

Removing a watermark isn’t bad, especially when you put in a lot of effort to create and edit the video. Watermarking means that the person using or handling the video is not the rightful owner; this is possible with the help of tags or logos. Luckily, there are simple ways to help remove watermarks from any video. However, some of this software is easy to use; you to edit the video file before uploading it to YouTube or any platform of your choice. Below are two simple steps to remove a watermark from a video:

### 1\. Remove Watermark with the Crop tool

This method will entirely remove the watermark from your movie, but it will also crop out a portion of the video that contains the watermark. It might not work well with all video options, so you might lose some vital parts of the video frame. However, you can use Wondershare Filmora software to crop out the edges containing the watermark.

By this, import your video, right-click on the timeline, zoom the video and click on “crop” to manually trim the edges to your chosen size or use the automatic option to select a ratio. Now adjust the edges of the cropping box to remove the watermark. You’ve successfully erased a watermark from your movie by clicking OK to apply the cropping effect.

However, one of the setbacks is that you will have to cut out some parts of the video, and it does not work if the watermark is in any other position other than the corners.

### 2\. Apowersoft Website

Apowersoft is a web-based platform that allows you to remove watermark from video clips and images in very few steps. Other features available on the website include file compressor, Movie edition, video producer, and many more. However, below is a guide on using Apowersoft to remove watermarks from your video.

* Go to apowersoft.com in your browser. Then click on “Products & Solution” to choose from the Video Editor tab of the Online section.
* To remove the watermark, search and click on it.
* You can now upload the video to the website. After that, click the preview button to see a video preview, and then click the Add Box button to select a watermark for the video.
* Click on the “Erase button” to crop out the watermark section.
* Finally, download it to your PC.

## Conclusion

● Finding a video trimmer without a watermark can be difficult, and the truth is, having watermarks on your video makes it unprofessional. Though it might be for fun or personal use, why leave the watermarks when you can trim them off with a few clicks. There are many video trimmers out there, but the ones listed in this article will help you trim videos without watermark and, most importantly, without really losing the original texture of the clip. Therefore, you can check them out to see what works for you.

## Part 3: FAQ

**Is the New M1 iPad Pro Good for Video Editing?**

Like most Apple products, the iPad Pro exterior hasn’t changed much compared to its predecessors, as the real magical upgrades are inside. The new M1 chip, the magnificent XDR display, 120Hz Refresh Rate, unbelievable Performance, Magic Keyboard, Thunderbolt 3, and USB 4 is enough to recognize the latest iPad Pro as the most powerful tablet ever made that can do everything that a Laptop can! Other hallmarks like the trackpad and magnetic slide — make it the perfect substitute for anyone looking to replace their laptop with an iPad Pro for video editing.

## Part4: Conclusion

Touch screens can be difficult to handle when performing precise operations like video-editing; that is why it is critical to use only the best video-editors on iPad.

Editor’s choice: Filmora. Reason: suitable for beginners and intuitive interface.

* [**Part 3: FAQ**](#part3)

## Part 1: 5 Best Video Editing Apps for iPad

### 1\. Filmora (Recommended)

Available for iOS (i.e., for iPad) and Android users, [Filmora](https://tools.techidaily.com/wondershare/filmora/download/) is the most viable option if you want to take your videos to the next level from your mobile screens. The easy-to-use interface allows even the naivest users to adapt the video skills quickly plus it being easy-on-eyes also enables you to edit videos seamlessly. Given the dedicated options for everything — tripping & cutting videos to adding audio, photos, and subtitles — editing videos will not take time.

[![Download filmora](https://images.wondershare.com/filmora/guide/google_play.jpg) ](https://app.adjust.com/w06dr6m%5F19za1f6) [![Download filmora](https://images.wondershare.com/filmora/guide/apple_store.jpg)](https://app.adjust.com/w06dr6m%5F19za1f6)

**Pros:**

* New upgrades have brought Advanced Crop features
* You can set duration of video motion
* Filmora includes all the basic video-editing features you might expect, like cutting, merging, cropping, and rotating video footage

**Cons:**

**Price:**

**Free version available**

Filmora Pro (1 Year) — $32.99

Filmora Pro （1 Month） — $6.99

Remove Logo Roll — $4.99more

### 2\. LumaFusion (best for iPad)

Recommended for iPad users, LumaFusion is a multitrack mobile video editor used by professionals. However, unlike Filmora, LumaFusion does not make it simple for an average Joe to utilize the application to its full extent. In fact, LumaFusion recommends video tutorials if you are a beginner to video-editing. Nevertheless, when it comes to feature-set, LumaFusion has one of the most advanced libraries of features that allows you to tell compelling video stories.

**Pros:**

* Uncluttered, intuitive, and customizable user interface
* Advanced and adjustable image stabilizer

**Cons:**

* No android app available yet
* Not friendly for beginners
* No free version

**Price:** US$ 29.99, extra subscription for Storyblocks needed

### 3\. iMovie

Of course, how can we forget Apple’s native iMovie video editor? Yes, it lacks some bells and whistles, but it makes basic video editing a breeze. Suitable for beginners, iMovie's main aim is to provide ease of use in a clean and elegant interface. In all, you will not find advanced video-editing options. But when it comes to basic features like tripping, cutting, adding audio, subtitles, and transition effects — iMovie is second to no one in terms of usability.

**Pros:**

* Cross-platform apps for all Apple devices
* Features like the Trailer timeline make the whole process seamless
* Simple and easy-to-use interface — suitable for beginners
* Good range of fun templates
* Multiple audio-editing options
* Completely free to use

**Cons:**

* For the sake of simplicity, iMovie excludes some critical functions like motion-tracking and more.
* No advanced options like editing 360-degree video editing

**Price:** Free

### 4\. KineMaster

In the world where iPad Pro video editors rise and fall, KineMaster has survived all these years because of its powerful features and simplicity. Overall, if you are looking for a tool to edit videos on the go — you should take a serious look at KineMaster.

**Pros:**

* Includes advanced video editing options like Speed Control, Effects, Themes, Adjustments, Multiple Layers, Overlays, Music, Audio Filters, Frame-by-Frame Trimming, Volume Envelope, Stickers, and more!
* Straightforward interface and precise controls

**Cons:**

* Costly compared to the top competitors; especially, given the shy feature-set

**Price:**

* Premium Monthly — $7.99
* Premium Yearly — $35.99
* Legacy - Remove Watermark — $29.99
* Premium One-Time Purchase — $69.99

### 5\. Filmmaker Pro

Holding features like LUT effects, 4K capability, chroma key to add crazy 3D transitions, Filmmaker Pro is a viable option for any beginner learning how to edit videos.

**Pros:**

* Cross-platform support
* Multiple export options like YouTube
* Intuitive and simple interface

**Cons:**

* Subscription is compulsory if you want to remove the watermarks

**Price:**

* US$ 5.99 per month

## Part 2: Edit Video on Desktop with Filmora

Available for both macOS and Windows, Wondershare’s Filmora is the best software if you are looking for a computer tool for HD video editing.

[![Download Win Version](https://images.wondershare.com/filmora/guide/download-btn-win.jpg)](https://tools.techidaily.com/wondershare/filmora/download/)[![Download Mac Version](https://images.wondershare.com/filmora/guide/download-btn-mac.jpg)](https://tools.techidaily.com/wondershare/filmora/download/)
