Though few people are watching DVDs nowadays, for some reason, DVDs are not yet ready to leave the market and even conspiring a strategy to retake their position instead. To rival the 4K streaming, the 4K Blu-rays rummor has been made real. DVD companies this year rolls out shiny 4K Blu-rays which are not region-locked for movies including _The Martian, Life of Pi, The Lego Movie, Mad Max: Fury Road, Chappie and Hancock_ and _Kingsman: The Secret Service_  ranging from £20 to £25\. **4K Blu-ray player** manufacturers also seize the opportunity in this niche market and reveal their newest **4K Blu-ray Players** under the sun.

#### **Why you may need to buy a 4K Blu-ray player to play 4K Blu-ray videos?**

This is because the regular Blu-ray discs are encoded under the H.262/MPEG-2 Part 2, H.264/MPEG-4 AVC and VC-1, while 4K Blu-ray discs are encoded under the H.265/HEVC standard, which can be one of the many reasons why ordinary Blu-ray players cannot handle 4K Blu-ray. Also, 4K Blu-ray discs are multilayer discs, dual-layer for 66GB while triple-layer for 100GB, which can perplex your current player. Besides, the read mechanism and the size of 4K Blu-rays are still not clear, though it is for sure that additional features like higher frames-rates at 60HZ, expanded color with wider color gamut and greater capacity up to 100GB are pinned on earth.
