 A device message appears after its connection. **For example** : In the above screen, an Android device shows the message '**Turn On USB Debugging** '. To continue from this stage, USB Debugging must be allowed on the Android device's end. Similarly, for iOS devices '**Trust Device** ' message appears.

**_Note_**   _: For more information, please refer to the section ' **[How to enable the USB Debugging mode in your phone?](https://tools.techidaily.com/stellardata-recovery/buy-now/)**  ' in the next topic of this user guide._

 3\. All the devices along with their information like process (**Erase** **)** , USB port name, type, progress bar, status, ECID/IMEI, and serial number are displayed. You can also see icons for connectivity status, SIM card status, and FMD (Find my device) locked/unlocked status.

![Stellar Help](https://www.stellarinfo.com/help/public/onlinehelp_img/stellar-eraser-for-mobile-1-mac-standard-en/erasure-process/devices-information.png)

 4\. You can preview the device's information either in **Grid view** ![Stellar Help](https://www.stellarinfo.com/help/public/onlinehelp_img/stellar-eraser-for-mobile-1-mac-standard-en/erasure-process/grid-view.png) or **List view** ![Stellar Help](https://www.stellarinfo.com/help/public/onlinehelp_img/stellar-eraser-for-mobile-1-mac-standard-en/erasure-process/list-view.png) .

* In the **Grid view** , the devices get displayed in a grid-like structure, and also the devices can be sort using the **Sort By** option. The **Sort By** option allows sorting the devices based on the following information/criteria: USB ID, Name, Serial Number, Type, Size, ECID/IMEI, and Status.

| Peter Gutmann (35 passes)                                | This algorithm wipes data by overwriting it 35 times, making recovery of the wiped data by any tool impossible. This algorithm takes more time than other wiping algorithms.                                                                                                                                                                                     |
| US-Army AR 380-19 (3 passes)                             | This algorithm wipes data by overwriting the media in three passes. In the first pass, it overwrites data with random bytes, then in the second and third pass, it overwrites data with certain bytes and their complements. This is a U.S. Army algorithm.                                                                                                      |
| US Air Force, AFSSI 5020(3 passes)                       | This algorithm wipes data by overwriting the media in three passes.

| British HMG IS5 (3 passes)                               | This algorithm is a three pass overwriting algorithm, first pass - with zeros, the second pass–with ones and the last pass with random data.                                                                                                                                                                                                                     |

 9\. Click **Start**  to start erasing the devices.

**_Note:_**   _If you wish to erase a single device, you can start the process by simply clicking the play button in the middle._

 10\. A warning message appears asking to proceed to the erasure process. Click **Proceed** .

![Stellar Help](https://www.stellarinfo.com/help/public/onlinehelp_img/stellar-eraser-for-mobile-1-mac-standard-en/erasure-process/warning-proceed.png)

**_Note:_**   _If you do not wish to see the warning message the next time you erase a device, select the **Don't Show Again** check-box._

 The erase process for a device takes place in five different phases, to understand these phases refer to the next section of **[Erasure Stages](https://lightailing.sjv.io/k0ez0m)**  .
