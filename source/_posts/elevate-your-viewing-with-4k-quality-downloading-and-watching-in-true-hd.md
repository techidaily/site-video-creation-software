4K resolution: As the most blazing tech jargon, 4K resolution enhances the level of image quality. It influences almost anything concerning image and video display, ranging from TVs, phones, computer monitors to cameras, camcorders and even 4K games. But, what the heck is this 4K resolution? How to play 4K resolution videos? [5KPlayer](https://tools.techidaily.com/5kplayer/products/) will present you the answer.

## What is 4K Resolution?

4K resolution refers to a display device or content having horizontal resolution on the order of 4,000 pixels. 4K resolution provides more pixels than the ordinary HD 1080p images, thus, giving more nuance and details.

Let's do this math:   
 4K: 4096(horizontal) X 2160(vertical) =8,847,360 pixels  
 HD: 1920(horizontal) X 1080(vertical) =2,073,400 pixels  
 The pixel of 4K resolution is over 4 times that of the HD 1080p, the clearer, the better!

And if that is too abstract for you, watch this:
