<p>Pexels.com is a free-to-use provider of high-resolution photos and videos for aspiring creators. The German-based website was started in 2014 by two brothers and has been under the Canva umbrella since 2018.</p>
<p>Currently, the website hosts over 3.2 million images and videos from over 250,000 active contributors. In addition, all the material you find in its library is under the Pexels license, which slightly varies from the creative commons zero license model. Some of the restrictions it enforces include:</p>
<ul>
<li>You can only use pexels images for commercial use after making alterations to the original image. For example, you can use part of an image to create a collage for your commercial branding.</li>
<li>Furthermore, you cannot use any of the website’s content to promote political ideologies and explicit content, especially if the images contain identifiable subjects.</li>
</ul>
<p>Pexels is available through the following channels:</p>
<ul>
<li>Your web browser by typing the URL pexels.com.</li>
<li>The Android and iOS app.</li>
<li>A plugin for other content creation software such as Google Slides and MS Office.</li>
<li>An extension on your Chrome browser.</li>
<li>You can also access the database using the official Canva app.</li>

<p>Another website that offers free images for commercial use is Unsplash, a subsidiary of Getty Images since 2021.

In addition, the database consists of over 3.48 million photos from more than 265,000 unique contributors, all under the Unsplash license.</p>
<p>The Unsplash license restricts the sale of its creative assets without incorporating new creative elements, including using them in print media and physical goods such as mugs and caps.</p>
<p>You can access Unsplash from your web browser or request API integration for your application from the site’s owners.

<li>Freerange Stock also purchases image rights or directly commissions photos from independent creators.</li>
<li>You can also contribute to the website’s library by voluntarily submitting your work to the platform. Kindly note that you will need a verified account to enable this function.</li>
<li>The website also works directly with photographers through a licensing and distribution model, providing them extra exposure on the site.</li>
<li>Finally, Freerange stock aggregates public domain images from other sources, including similar sites and government institutions. It does so by acknowledging the image owner and sometimes lists the image source when the owner is unknown.</li>
</ul>
<p>Freerange Stock is accessible through your web browser or as an API integration on your app.</p>
<h3 id="4-Vecteezy"><a href="#4-Vecteezy" class="headerlink" title="4. Vecteezy"></a>4. Vecteezy</h3><p><img

<h2 id="Part-2-Buy-from-stock-providers"><a href="#Part-2-Buy-from-stock-providers" class="headerlink" title="Part 2: Buy from stock providers"></a>Part 2: Buy from stock providers</h2><p>Another way to get images for commercial use is by buying them from stock providers. Some of the benefits of buying images from stock providers include:</p>
<ul>
<li>You get a wide selection of unique photos from top-tier photographers. Stock providers always seek collaborations with the industry’s finest to edge out the competition.</li>
<li>You receive exemplary customer service with your purchase. Selecting the right image can be confusing for amateur creators. As such, stock image providers have customer support channels to help you throughout your creative process.</li>
<li>Stock images reduce your delivery times significantly. Buying images from a stock provider eliminates the need to invest in photography equipment and the time you need for post-production. As such, you can deliver projects in a fast and cost-effective way.</li>
</ul>
<p>Despite the above positive, here are some challenges that buying stock images may present:</p>
<ul>
<li>Not all stock image providers will have the creative assets you need.</li>
<li>Image overuse is likely since every creator will rush for the most popular contributor.</li>
</ul>
<p>Below are some of the stock image providers you should consider.</p>
<h3 id="1-iStock"><a href="#1-iStock" class="headerlink" title="1. iStock"></a>1. iStock</h3><p>iStockphoto.com is an online database of creative resources, including royalty-free photos, videos, audio, illustrations, and clip art you can use in your creations. The website is a Getty Images subsidiary based in Calgary, Canada. In addition, contributors earn royalties depending on how often users download their content.</p>
<h3 id="2-Alamy-com"><a href="#2-Alamy-com" class="headerlink" title="2. Alamy.com"></a>2. Alamy.com</h3><p>Alamy.com is a British-owned stock image provider with contributions from photographers and agencies in 173 countries. It compensates its contributors by offering higher than average payouts every time users download their creations. Some popular brands to use Alamy’s services include M&amp;C Saatchi, Microsoft, and The Economist.</p>
<h2 id="Part-3-Shot-a-Photo-by-yourself-or-create-one-with-editing-tools"><a href="#Part-3-Shot-a-Photo-by-yourself-or-create-one-with-editing-tools" class="headerlink" title="Part 3: Shot a Photo by yourself or create one with editing tools"></a>Part 3: Shot a Photo by yourself or create one with editing tools</h2><p>Alternatively, you can get images for commercial use by shooting them yourself or creating them with editing tools such as Figma and Wondershare’s Filmstock. Here are some benefits of using this method:</p>
<ul>
<li>You get exactly what you want, provided you have the required skills and equipment. Sometimes, getting the right image for your commercial purpose can be challenging. As such, shooting an original photo may be the only option.</li>
<li>You have full ownership of the image.</li>
</ul>
<p>Unlike obtaining images from stock photography websites, you are free to use the image in whatever capacity you please without any restrictions. For example, sites such as Unsplash do not allow you to use their images in political statements, a restriction you can bypass when using your own creations.</p>
<p>However, you should also consider the following factors when using this method.</p>
<h3 id="It-requires-a-substantial-investment"><a href="#It-requires-a-substantial-investment" class="headerlink" title="It requires a substantial investment"></a>It requires a substantial investment</h3><p>Getting high-quality images for commercial purposes requires specialist equipment. For example, the Panasonic LUMIX GH6 camera, which has 4K resolution capability, costs $2,197 on Amazon. This makes it extremely expensive for amateur creators.</p>
<h3 id="There-is-a-steep-learning-curve"><a href="#There-is-a-steep-learning-curve" class="headerlink" title="There is a steep learning curve"></a>There is a steep learning curve</h3><p>Becoming a professional photographer takes time and effort. Unless you are creating as a hobby, it will be a while before you can start generating income from your creations.</p>

Stock image sites like pexels.com allow you to download images from their website without creating an account. You will only need one if you want to showcase your work on the platform.</p>

<h2 id="Part-5-FAQ-about-Animated-Logo-Makers-3"><a href="#Part-5-FAQ-about-Animated-Logo-Makers-3" class="headerlink" title="Part 5: FAQ about Animated Logo Makers"></a>Part 5: FAQ about Animated Logo Makers</h2><h3 id="1-Which-software-is-best-for-logo-animation-3"><a href="#1-Which-software-is-best-for-logo-animation-3" class="headerlink" title="1. Which software is best for logo animation?"></a>1. Which software is best for logo animation?</h3><p>Logo animation software is not short on the ground. Most regular editing programs will have features that let you add an animation to your logo. We would recommend that you look at After Effects, by Adobe, since it contains numerous features specifically dealing with animation. You may even be able to use the free version of this software without paying for the whole program.</p>
<p>Logo animation software in aftereffects usually needs to be applied to existing footage. Otherwise, you can find it available for download by following this link.</p>
<h3 id="2-How-do-I-make-an-animated-logo-3"><a href="#2-How-do-I-make-an-animated-logo-3" class="headerlink" title="2. How do I make an animated logo?"></a>2. How do I make an animated logo?</h3><p>When you are using Filmora Pro as your logo animation software, there are steps you need to take to achieve full animation. First, prepare your file by opening a new workspace with a web resolution of about 320 x 240. Select your background layer, then add in any graphics or art you have for your logo. Choose the effect you want to apply and drag and drop it, then adjust the settings in the box that pops up.</p>
<p>You can assign keyframes for specific actions or play with the settings to achieve the animation you had in mind.</p>
<h3 id="3-How-do-I-make-an-animated-logo-for-free-3"><a href="#3-How-do-I-make-an-animated-logo-for-free-3" class="headerlink" title="3. How do I make an animated logo for free?"></a>3. How do I make an animated logo for free?</h3><p>PixTeller is such an excellent service because it has logo animation software that is free to use. It allows you to work with all types of formats. So if you have a logo as a JPEG, or whether you want to draw it out in vector graphics, you can do so.</p>
<h2 id="Final-Verdict-3"><a href="#Final-Verdict-3" class="headerlink" title="Final Verdict"></a>Final Verdict</h2><p>We would here like to state that you can use Wondershare Filmora if you want to make a breathtaking intro video. This software is the best choice for its 2D and 3D intro logo effects package. Also, we hope that by now, you have decided which to use and started working on your logo intros. You can share with us if we missed any other logo animation maker and if you like this post. Thanks!</p>
