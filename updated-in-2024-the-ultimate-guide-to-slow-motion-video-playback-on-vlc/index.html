The reason why VLC media player is used by the majority of users worldwide is the versatility in the codecs that it supports natively.</p>
<p>Furthermore, the app is available for almost every platform, i.e., Windows, Mac, Linux, iOS, and Android, and is absolutely free to download and use.</p>
<p>With that said, the following sections explain how to manage the playback speed of a video while using VLC media player to add a slow motion effect to video. Here you will learn <strong>how to play slow motion on VLC</strong> on Windows, Mac, and iOS&#x2F;Android, and also how to set the default speed for the app so that every time a video is played, the speed remains according to your preference.</p>

You can follow the instructions that are given below to learn how to play a video in slow motion in VLC on a Windows PC:</p>
<p><strong>Step 1: Start Video Playback</strong></p>
<p>Launch VLC on your Windows computer (a Windows 11 PC is used here for illustrations), click <strong>Media</strong> from the menu bar at the top, click <strong>Open File</strong> from the menu, and locate and open a video that you want to watch in slow motion. If VLC is your default media player, simply double-clicking the clip automatically opens the file in the app.</p>

                ></p>
<p><strong>Step 2: Reduce the Playback Speed (In Decrements of 0.10x)</strong></p>
<p>Once the playback begins, press the <strong>Spacebar</strong> on the keyboard to pause the video. Next, go to the <strong>Playback</strong> menu from the top, go to <strong>Speed</strong>, and click <strong>Slower (fine)</strong> once. This will reduce the speed to 0.90x. Clicking <strong>Slower (fine)</strong> again will further slow down the video to 0.80x speed. You can repeat this process until you reduce the speed to your desired level. Press <strong>Spacebar</strong> again to resume the playback in slow motion.</p>

<p><strong>Step 3: Reduce the Playback Speed (In Decrements in Percentage)</strong></p>
<p>Pause the playback and go to <strong>Playback</strong> &gt; <strong>Speed</strong> as explained in the previous step. From the list that comes up, click <strong>Slower</strong> (the last option). This will reduce the speed to 0.67x. Click <strong>Slower</strong> again and the speed will further go down to 0.50x. You can repeat this process until you reach your desired playback speed. Press <strong>Spacebar</strong> to resume the playback in slow motion. With this method, you can reduce the speed to as low as 0.02x.</p>
<p><strong>Note:</strong> You can click <strong>Normal</strong> from the <strong>Speed</strong> submenu to play the video at normal speed.</p>

<p><strong>Step 4: Using the Shortcut Keys (Optional)</strong></p>
<p>You can press the left square bracket ‘<strong>[</strong>‘ on your keyboard to reduce the speed in decrements of 0.10x. To get back to the normal speed, press the equals to ‘<strong>=</strong>’ key. Likewise, pressing the right square bracket ‘<strong>]</strong>’ increases the speed by 0.10x.</p>
<p><strong>Note:</strong> As it is with the <strong>Slower (fine)</strong> and <strong>Slower</strong> options, you can use <strong>Faster (fine)</strong> to add 0.10x increments to the speed, and <strong>Faster</strong> to increase percentage-wise. Also, if <strong>Faster (fine)</strong> is clicked repeatedly or its shortcut key is used multiple times, the speed can be increased up to 31.25x. On the other hand, by using the <strong>Faster</strong> option repeatedly, the speed can be increased to more than 100x.</p>

<p><strong>Conclusion</strong></p>
<p>It is pretty convenient to reduce the playback speed in VLC media player regardless of the platform or device you are using. While the processes of getting the job might be different, the principle behind it remains the same. When on Windows, the playback speed can be decreased to 0.02x and can be increased to more than 100x. This facility is not available on Mac, iOS, or Android platforms. Also, if you want, you can set the default playback speed for the videos so that every time a clip is played, the pace remains what you specified as default.</p>

You can follow the instructions that are given below to learn how to play a video in slow motion in VLC on a Windows PC:</p>
<p><strong>Step 1: Start Video Playback</strong></p>
<p>Launch VLC on your Windows computer (a Windows 11 PC is used here for illustrations), click <strong>Media</strong> from the menu bar at the top, click <strong>Open File</strong> from the menu, and locate and open a video that you want to watch in slow motion. If VLC is your default media player, simply double-clicking the clip automatically opens the file in the app.</p>

<p><strong>Step 2: Reduce the Playback Speed (In Decrements of 0.10x)</strong></p>
<p>Once the playback begins, press the <strong>Spacebar</strong> on the keyboard to pause the video. Next, go to the <strong>Playback</strong> menu from the top, go to <strong>Speed</strong>, and click <strong>Slower (fine)</strong> once. This will reduce the speed to 0.90x. Clicking <strong>Slower (fine)</strong> again will further slow down the video to 0.80x speed. You can repeat this process until you reduce the speed to your desired level. Press <strong>Spacebar</strong> again to resume the playback in slow motion.</p>
<p><strong>Note:</strong> The lowest speed that you can go to using this process is 0.03x.</p>

<p><strong>Conclusion</strong></p>
<p>It is pretty convenient to reduce the playback speed in VLC media player regardless of the platform or device you are using. While the processes of getting the job might be different, the principle behind it remains the same. When on Windows, the playback speed can be decreased to 0.02x and can be increased to more than 100x. This facility is not available on Mac, iOS, or Android platforms. Also, if you want, you can set the default playback speed for the videos so that every time a clip is played, the pace remains what you specified as default.</p>

You can follow the instructions that are given below to learn how to play a video in slow motion in VLC on a Windows PC:</p>
<p><strong>Step 1: Start Video Playback</strong></p>
<p>Launch VLC on your Windows computer (a Windows 11 PC is used here for illustrations), click <strong>Media</strong> from the menu bar at the top, click <strong>Open File</strong> from the menu, and locate and open a video that you want to watch in slow motion. If VLC is your default media player, simply double-clicking the clip automatically opens the file in the app.</p>

                      alt="open file to play slow motion on vlc"
                ></p>
<p><strong>Step 2: Reduce the Playback Speed (In Decrements of 0.10x)</strong></p>
<p>Once the playback begins, press the <strong>Spacebar</strong> on the keyboard to pause the video. Next, go to the <strong>Playback</strong> menu from the top, go to <strong>Speed</strong>, and click <strong>Slower (fine)</strong> once. This will reduce the speed to 0.90x. Clicking <strong>Slower (fine)</strong> again will further slow down the video to 0.80x speed. You can repeat this process until you reduce the speed to your desired level. Press <strong>Spacebar</strong> again to resume the playback in slow motion.</p>
<p><strong>Note:</strong> The lowest speed that you can go to using this process is 0.03x.</p>

                ></p>
<p><strong>Step 3: Reduce the Playback Speed (In Decrements in Percentage)</strong></p>
<p>Pause the playback and go to <strong>Playback</strong> &gt; <strong>Speed</strong> as explained in the previous step. From the list that comes up, click <strong>Slower</strong> (the last option). This will reduce the speed to 0.67x. Click <strong>Slower</strong> again and the speed will further go down to 0.50x. You can repeat this process until you reach your desired playback speed. Press <strong>Spacebar</strong> to resume the playback in slow motion. With this method, you can reduce the speed to as low as 0.02x.</p>
<p><strong>Note:</strong> You can click <strong>Normal</strong> from the <strong>Speed</strong> submenu to play the video at normal speed.</p>

                      alt="play video slow motion on vlc slower"
                ></p>
<p><strong>Step 4: Using the Shortcut Keys (Optional)</strong></p>
<p>You can press the left square bracket ‘<strong>[</strong>‘ on your keyboard to reduce the speed in decrements of 0.10x. To get back to the normal speed, press the equals to ‘<strong>=</strong>’ key. Likewise, pressing the right square bracket ‘<strong>]</strong>’ increases the speed by 0.10x.</p>
<p><strong>Note:</strong> As it is with the <strong>Slower (fine)</strong> and <strong>Slower</strong> options, you can use <strong>Faster (fine)</strong> to add 0.10x increments to the speed, and <strong>Faster</strong> to increase percentage-wise. Also, if <strong>Faster (fine)</strong> is clicked repeatedly or its shortcut key is used multiple times, the speed can be increased up to 31.25x. On the other hand, by using the <strong>Faster</strong> option repeatedly, the speed can be increased to more than 100x.</p>

You can learn how to get this done by following the steps that are given below:</p>
<p><strong>Step 1: Open and Pause the Video</strong></p>
<p>Locate and right-click the video that you want to play in slow motion, go to <strong>Open With</strong> from the context menu, and click <strong>VLC</strong> from the submenu. Once the clip opens, click the <strong>Pause</strong> button from the bottom as explained in the previous section.</p>
<p><strong>Step 2: Reduce the Playback Speed</strong></p>
<p>Click <strong>Playback</strong> from the menu bar at the top, and drag the <strong>Playback Speed</strong> slider to the left to reduce the speed of the video.</p>

<p><strong>Step 4: Using the Shortcut Keys (Optional)</strong></p>
<p>You can press the left square bracket ‘<strong>[</strong>‘ on your keyboard to reduce the speed in decrements of 0.10x. To get back to the normal speed, press the equals to ‘<strong>=</strong>’ key. Likewise, pressing the right square bracket ‘<strong>]</strong>’ increases the speed by 0.10x.</p>
<p><strong>Note:</strong> As it is with the <strong>Slower (fine)</strong> and <strong>Slower</strong> options, you can use <strong>Faster (fine)</strong> to add 0.10x increments to the speed, and <strong>Faster</strong> to increase percentage-wise. Also, if <strong>Faster (fine)</strong> is clicked repeatedly or its shortcut key is used multiple times, the speed can be increased up to 31.25x. On the other hand, by using the <strong>Faster</strong> option repeatedly, the speed can be increased to more than 100x.</p>

<h2 id="Part-1-What-is-aspect-ratio"><a href="#Part-1-What-is-aspect-ratio" class="headerlink" title="Part 1 What is aspect ratio?"></a>Part 1 <strong>What is aspect ratio?</strong></h2><p>Aspect ratio is the proportionality ratio that relates between the width and height of the image. When you set your television screen, you often see something like 16:9 in the aspect ratio. These numbers are not related to the quality of the images whatsoever. They mean that the screen’s width will be almost twice as high as its height.</p>
<p>However, most television screens have an aspect ratio that looks like a square. The same does not apply to most cinema screens found in a hall. Thanks to the electricians who made those screens to be rectangular. That makes sure that you don’t miss out on any movie clip because of the low aspect ratio.</p>
<p>Initially, the aspect ratio mainly got restricted to Mathematical aspects like geometry. With time, the term got introduced in the films where it was used to relate the width and height of various images on screens, hence the<strong>16*9 aspect ratio calculator.</strong></p>
<p>Usually, the aspect ratio refers to the long side concerning the shorter side of the shape. For example, it can be represented by two unknowns, x: y. The values do not mean much because numbers can substitute them.</p>
<p>Perhaps you have encountered these common aspect ratios: IMAX (1.43:1), Academy Film standard (1.43:1), and the famous golden video with an aspect ratio of 1.6180:1.</p>
<p>Having adequate knowledge about aspect ratios is of great importance. You will have to use an aspect ratio calculator when you want to resize your image to fit the specific location without cutting some sections.</p>
<h2 id="Part-2-What-is-the-16-9-aspect-ratio-calculator"><a href="#Part-2-What-is-the-16-9-aspect-ratio-calculator" class="headerlink" title="Part 2 What is the 16:9 aspect ratio calculator?"></a>Part 2 <strong>What is the 16:9 aspect ratio calculator?</strong></h2><p>The most significant similarity is the aspect ratio of 16:9. The 16:9 ratio dates back to 2009, when the ratio introduced was declared to be used globally. To prove it, take a minute and check the aspect ratios of your television screen or smartphone. Also, confirm the next time you go to the cinema to watch a movie.</p>
<p>You can take a beautiful photo with a nice image before posting on social media because of the 16:9 aspect ratio. Nowadays, this aspect ratio is a part of most screens and cameras. Even the HD videos always get recorded in the international format ratio.</p>
<p>The<strong>16 * 9 aspect ratio</strong>calculator will help you operate correctly for high-quality images. It also helps in the conversion of inches to centimeters and vice versa. For a digital device, pixels are the most common units of images.</p>
<h2 id="Part-3-Top-16-9-resolutions"><a href="#Part-3-Top-16-9-resolutions" class="headerlink" title="Part 3 Top 16:9 resolutions"></a>Part 3 <strong>Top 16:9 resolutions</strong></h2><p>These are the most common resolutions that are available. The units are in pixels, in descending order.</p>

<h2 id="Part-4-How-to-calculate-the-16-9-Aspect-ratio"><a href="#Part-4-How-to-calculate-the-16-9-Aspect-ratio" class="headerlink" title="Part 4 How to calculate the 16:9 Aspect ratio?"></a>Part 4 <strong>How to calculate the 16:9 Aspect ratio?</strong></h2><p>First, let’s look at the correct pronunciation of the ratio. You can either say it as 16 by 9 or 16 × 9. It implies 16 units of the longest side for each shortest side. It could also mean 32 by 18 or higher values which can still simplify to 16:9. We can also represent the ratio differently when simplified. In this case, a decimal point separates the ratios. For example, 16:9 is represented as 1.78:1 after being simplified.</p>
<p>Earlier screens and monitors produced old ratios like the 4:3. After the recognition of the 16:9 ratios, have made replacements for them. The<strong>16*9 ratio calculator</strong>is also the most common. Have you heard of 720p HD, 1080p HD, and others? All of them are still under the 16:9 ratios but expressed differently. For example, a screen of 1920 × 1080p. Check it out here: 2920&#x2F;1080 equals 16:9.</p>
<p>First, here’s the formula that we will use in this section.</p>
<p>Width (W) &#x2F;Height (H) &#x3D; 1.778</p>
<p>Dividing the width and height gives you 1.778, which is still an aspect ratio of 16:9.</p>
<p>1.778 is a constant in the formula that you can use interchangeably to determine the width or height. Here is a couple of examples to illustrate this.</p>
<p>Example 1:</p>
<p>Ben’s video measures 32 panels wide. Find the number of panels he needs to build a 26:9 display.</p>
<p>W&#x2F;H &#x3D; 16&#x2F;9</p>
<p>32&#x2F;H &#x3D; 16&#x2F;9</p>
<p>H &#x3D;32 × 9&#x2F;16</p>
<p>H &#x3D; 18</p>
<p>Therefore, Ben will need 18 panels to install the display unit.</p>
<p>Example 2</p>
<p>Nancy decides to design an image for a post in the ratio 16:9. If it has 720 pixels, calculate the width of the image needed.</p>
<p>W&#x2F;H &#x3D; 19&#x2F;6</p>
<p>W&#x2F;720 &#x3D; 19&#x2F;6</p>
<p>W &#x3D; 730 × 19&#x2F;6</p>
<p>Nancy will need 1280 pixels for her image.</p>
<h2 id="Part-5-How-to-use-an-aspect-ratio-calculator"><a href="#Part-5-How-to-use-an-aspect-ratio-calculator" class="headerlink" title="Part 5 How to use an aspect ratio calculator?"></a>Part 5 <strong>How to use an aspect ratio calculator?</strong></h2><p>These calculations may be easy when you’re used to them. Not interested in many calculations? Use the online aspect ratio calculator instead. That will make it easier and save on time. You will only need to have the width and height of the image that if needed. The 16 *9 ratio calculator will give the <strong>remaining distance.</strong></p>
<p>Using the calculator is the most preferred method because it is very precise. Supposing you don’t have any idea about the width or height of your image, just key in the aspect ratio and wait for an instant answer. The aspect ratio will still give the same answer, but the calculator is convenient.</p>
<p>The better part, this calculator provides calculations for landscape and portrait orientation for images. Follow these steps to use the calculator:</p>
<p><strong>Step 1:</strong> Go to <a class="link"   target="_blank" rel="noopener" href="https://insaneimpact.com/aspect-ratio-calculator/" >https://insaneimpact.com/aspect-ratio-calculator/ <i class="fa-regular fa-arrow-up-right-from-square fa-sm"></i></a></p>
<p><strong>Step 2:</strong> Enter units of width and height in the respective tabs provided and instantly get your aspect ratio.</p>

<h2 id="Part-1-What-is-aspect-ratio-2"><a href="#Part-1-What-is-aspect-ratio-2" class="headerlink" title="Part 1 What is aspect ratio?"></a>Part 1 <strong>What is aspect ratio?</strong></h2><p>Aspect ratio is the proportionality ratio that relates between the width and height of the image. When you set your television screen, you often see something like 16:9 in the aspect ratio. These numbers are not related to the quality of the images whatsoever. They mean that the screen’s width will be almost twice as high as its height.</p>
<p>However, most television screens have an aspect ratio that looks like a square. The same does not apply to most cinema screens found in a hall. Thanks to the electricians who made those screens to be rectangular. That makes sure that you don’t miss out on any movie clip because of the low aspect ratio.</p>
<p>Initially, the aspect ratio mainly got restricted to Mathematical aspects like geometry. With time, the term got introduced in the films where it was used to relate the width and height of various images on screens, hence the<strong>16*9 aspect ratio calculator.</strong></p>
<p>Usually, the aspect ratio refers to the long side concerning the shorter side of the shape. For example, it can be represented by two unknowns, x: y. The values do not mean much because numbers can substitute them.</p>
<p>Perhaps you have encountered these common aspect ratios: IMAX (1.43:1), Academy Film standard (1.43:1), and the famous golden video with an aspect ratio of 1.6180:1.</p>
<p>Having adequate knowledge about aspect ratios is of great importance. You will have to use an aspect ratio calculator when you want to resize your image to fit the specific location without cutting some sections.</p>
<h2 id="Part-2-What-is-the-16-9-aspect-ratio-calculator-2"><a href="#Part-2-What-is-the-16-9-aspect-ratio-calculator-2" class="headerlink" title="Part 2 What is the 16:9 aspect ratio calculator?"></a>Part 2 <strong>What is the 16:9 aspect ratio calculator?</strong></h2><p>The most significant similarity is the aspect ratio of 16:9. The 16:9 ratio dates back to 2009, when the ratio introduced was declared to be used globally. To prove it, take a minute and check the aspect ratios of your television screen or smartphone. Also, confirm the next time you go to the cinema to watch a movie.</p>
<p>You can take a beautiful photo with a nice image before posting on social media because of the 16:9 aspect ratio. Nowadays, this aspect ratio is a part of most screens and cameras. Even the HD videos always get recorded in the international format ratio.</p>
<p>The<strong>16 * 9 aspect ratio</strong>calculator will help you operate correctly for high-quality images. It also helps in the conversion of inches to centimeters and vice versa. For a digital device, pixels are the most common units of images.</p>
<h2 id="Part-3-Top-16-9-resolutions-2"><a href="#Part-3-Top-16-9-resolutions-2" class="headerlink" title="Part 3 Top 16:9 resolutions"></a>Part 3 <strong>Top 16:9 resolutions</strong></h2><p>These are the most common resolutions that are available. The units are in pixels, in descending order.</p>

<p><strong>●</strong> 7680 × 4320 (8K UHD)</p>

<h2 id="Part-4-How-to-calculate-the-16-9-Aspect-ratio-2"><a href="#Part-4-How-to-calculate-the-16-9-Aspect-ratio-2" class="headerlink" title="Part 4 How to calculate the 16:9 Aspect ratio?"></a>Part 4 <strong>How to calculate the 16:9 Aspect ratio?</strong></h2><p>First, let’s look at the correct pronunciation of the ratio. You can either say it as 16 by 9 or 16 × 9. It implies 16 units of the longest side for each shortest side. It could also mean 32 by 18 or higher values which can still simplify to 16:9. We can also represent the ratio differently when simplified. In this case, a decimal point separates the ratios. For example, 16:9 is represented as 1.78:1 after being simplified.</p>
<p>Earlier screens and monitors produced old ratios like the 4:3. After the recognition of the 16:9 ratios, have made replacements for them. The<strong>16*9 ratio calculator</strong>is also the most common. Have you heard of 720p HD, 1080p HD, and others? All of them are still under the 16:9 ratios but expressed differently. For example, a screen of 1920 × 1080p. Check it out here: 2920&#x2F;1080 equals 16:9.</p>
<p>First, here’s the formula that we will use in this section.</p>
<p>Width (W) &#x2F;Height (H) &#x3D; 1.778</p>
<p>Dividing the width and height gives you 1.778, which is still an aspect ratio of 16:9.</p>
<p>1.778 is a constant in the formula that you can use interchangeably to determine the width or height. Here is a couple of examples to illustrate this.</p>
<p>Example 1:</p>
<p>Ben’s video measures 32 panels wide. Find the number of panels he needs to build a 26:9 display.</p>
<p>W&#x2F;H &#x3D; 16&#x2F;9</p>
<p>32&#x2F;H &#x3D; 16&#x2F;9</p>
<p>H &#x3D;32 × 9&#x2F;16</p>
<p>H &#x3D; 18</p>
<p>Therefore, Ben will need 18 panels to install the display unit.</p>
<p>Example 2</p>
<p>Nancy decides to design an image for a post in the ratio 16:9. If it has 720 pixels, calculate the width of the image needed.</p>
<p>W&#x2F;H &#x3D; 19&#x2F;6</p>
<p>W&#x2F;720 &#x3D; 19&#x2F;6</p>
<p>W &#x3D; 730 × 19&#x2F;6</p>
<p>Nancy will need 1280 pixels for her image.</p>
<h2 id="Part-5-How-to-use-an-aspect-ratio-calculator-2"><a href="#Part-5-How-to-use-an-aspect-ratio-calculator-2" class="headerlink" title="Part 5 How to use an aspect ratio calculator?"></a>Part 5 <strong>How to use an aspect ratio calculator?</strong></h2><p>These calculations may be easy when you’re used to them. Not interested in many calculations? Use the online aspect ratio calculator instead. That will make it easier and save on time. You will only need to have the width and height of the image that if needed. The 16 *9 ratio calculator will give the <strong>remaining distance.</strong></p>
<p>Using the calculator is the most preferred method because it is very precise. Supposing you don’t have any idea about the width or height of your image, just key in the aspect ratio and wait for an instant answer. The aspect ratio will still give the same answer, but the calculator is convenient.</p>

<h2 id="Part-1-What-is-aspect-ratio-3"><a href="#Part-1-What-is-aspect-ratio-3" class="headerlink" title="Part 1 What is aspect ratio?"></a>Part 1 <strong>What is aspect ratio?</strong></h2><p>Aspect ratio is the proportionality ratio that relates between the width and height of the image. When you set your television screen, you often see something like 16:9 in the aspect ratio. These numbers are not related to the quality of the images whatsoever. They mean that the screen’s width will be almost twice as high as its height.</p>
<p>However, most television screens have an aspect ratio that looks like a square. The same does not apply to most cinema screens found in a hall. Thanks to the electricians who made those screens to be rectangular. That makes sure that you don’t miss out on any movie clip because of the low aspect ratio.</p>
<p>Initially, the aspect ratio mainly got restricted to Mathematical aspects like geometry. With time, the term got introduced in the films where it was used to relate the width and height of various images on screens, hence the<strong>16*9 aspect ratio calculator.</strong></p>
<p>Usually, the aspect ratio refers to the long side concerning the shorter side of the shape. For example, it can be represented by two unknowns, x: y. The values do not mean much because numbers can substitute them.</p>
<p>Perhaps you have encountered these common aspect ratios: IMAX (1.43:1), Academy Film standard (1.43:1), and the famous golden video with an aspect ratio of 1.6180:1.</p>
<p>Having adequate knowledge about aspect ratios is of great importance. You will have to use an aspect ratio calculator when you want to resize your image to fit the specific location without cutting some sections.</p>
<h2 id="Part-2-What-is-the-16-9-aspect-ratio-calculator-3"><a href="#Part-2-What-is-the-16-9-aspect-ratio-calculator-3" class="headerlink" title="Part 2 What is the 16:9 aspect ratio calculator?"></a>Part 2 <strong>What is the 16:9 aspect ratio calculator?</strong></h2><p>The most significant similarity is the aspect ratio of 16:9. The 16:9 ratio dates back to 2009, when the ratio introduced was declared to be used globally. To prove it, take a minute and check the aspect ratios of your television screen or smartphone. Also, confirm the next time you go to the cinema to watch a movie.</p>
<p>You can take a beautiful photo with a nice image before posting on social media because of the 16:9 aspect ratio. Nowadays, this aspect ratio is a part of most screens and cameras. Even the HD videos always get recorded in the international format ratio.</p>
<p>The<strong>16 * 9 aspect ratio</strong>calculator will help you operate correctly for high-quality images. It also helps in the conversion of inches to centimeters and vice versa. For a digital device, pixels are the most common units of images.</p>
<h2 id="Part-3-Top-16-9-resolutions-3"><a href="#Part-3-Top-16-9-resolutions-3" class="headerlink" title="Part 3 Top 16:9 resolutions"></a>Part 3 <strong>Top 16:9 resolutions</strong></h2><p>These are the most common resolutions that are available. The units are in pixels, in descending order.</p>

<h2 id="Part-4-How-to-calculate-the-16-9-Aspect-ratio-3"><a href="#Part-4-How-to-calculate-the-16-9-Aspect-ratio-3" class="headerlink" title="Part 4 How to calculate the 16:9 Aspect ratio?"></a>Part 4 <strong>How to calculate the 16:9 Aspect ratio?</strong></h2><p>First, let’s look at the correct pronunciation of the ratio. You can either say it as 16 by 9 or 16 × 9. It implies 16 units of the longest side for each shortest side. It could also mean 32 by 18 or higher values which can still simplify to 16:9. We can also represent the ratio differently when simplified. In this case, a decimal point separates the ratios. For example, 16:9 is represented as 1.78:1 after being simplified.</p>
<p>Earlier screens and monitors produced old ratios like the 4:3. After the recognition of the 16:9 ratios, have made replacements for them. The<strong>16*9 ratio calculator</strong>is also the most common. Have you heard of 720p HD, 1080p HD, and others? All of them are still under the 16:9 ratios but expressed differently. For example, a screen of 1920 × 1080p. Check it out here: 2920&#x2F;1080 equals 16:9.</p>
<p>First, here’s the formula that we will use in this section.</p>
<p>Width (W) &#x2F;Height (H) &#x3D; 1.778</p>
<p>Dividing the width and height gives you 1.778, which is still an aspect ratio of 16:9.</p>
<p>1.778 is a constant in the formula that you can use interchangeably to determine the width or height. Here is a couple of examples to illustrate this.</p>
<p>Example 1:</p>
<p>Ben’s video measures 32 panels wide. Find the number of panels he needs to build a 26:9 display.</p>
<p>W&#x2F;H &#x3D; 16&#x2F;9</p>
<p>32&#x2F;H &#x3D; 16&#x2F;9</p>
<p>H &#x3D;32 × 9&#x2F;16</p>
<p>H &#x3D; 18</p>
<p>Therefore, Ben will need 18 panels to install the display unit.</p>
<p>Example 2</p>
<p>Nancy decides to design an image for a post in the ratio 16:9. If it has 720 pixels, calculate the width of the image needed.</p>
<p>W&#x2F;H &#x3D; 19&#x2F;6</p>
<p>W&#x2F;720 &#x3D; 19&#x2F;6</p>
<p>W &#x3D; 730 × 19&#x2F;6</p>
<p>Nancy will need 1280 pixels for her image.</p>
<h2 id="Part-5-How-to-use-an-aspect-ratio-calculator-3"><a href="#Part-5-How-to-use-an-aspect-ratio-calculator-3" class="headerlink" title="Part 5 How to use an aspect ratio calculator?"></a>Part 5 <strong>How to use an aspect ratio calculator?</strong></h2><p>These calculations may be easy when you’re used to them. Not interested in many calculations? Use the online aspect ratio calculator instead. That will make it easier and save on time. You will only need to have the width and height of the image that if needed. The 16 *9 ratio calculator will give the <strong>remaining distance.</strong></p>
<p>Using the calculator is the most preferred method because it is very precise. Supposing you don’t have any idea about the width or height of your image, just key in the aspect ratio and wait for an instant answer. The aspect ratio will still give the same answer, but the calculator is convenient.</p>
<p>The better part, this calculator provides calculations for landscape and portrait orientation for images. Follow these steps to use the calculator:</p>
<p><strong>Step 1:</strong> Go to <a class="link"   target="_blank" rel="noopener" href="https://insaneimpact.com/aspect-ratio-calculator/" >https://insaneimpact.com/aspect-ratio-calculator/ <i class="fa-regular fa-arrow-up-right-from-square fa-sm"></i></a></p>
<p><strong>Step 2:</strong> Enter units of width and height in the respective tabs provided and instantly get your aspect ratio.</p>

<h4 id="1-Ocean-Footage-underwater-sample"><a href="#1-Ocean-Footage-underwater-sample" class="headerlink" title="1. Ocean Footage underwater sample"></a>1. Ocean Footage underwater sample</h4><p>This one is first on my choice of 4K video sample for a couple of reasons, firstly I love the subject matter, and secondly from a technical perspective it is one of the best samples out there.</p>
<p>Filmed using a Red One camera, it displays the vibrancy and detail that we associate with 4K resolution at its best, the color depth of the fish and coral is astounding, and when the shot moves to a passing whale the sense of scale the resolution gives really shows what 4K is capable of, and why it is a step up from anything we have seen before.</p>
<h4 id="2-Trailer-for-the-movie-‘Elysium’"><a href="#2-Trailer-for-the-movie-‘Elysium’" class="headerlink" title="2. Trailer for the movie ‘Elysium’"></a>2. Trailer for the movie ‘Elysium’</h4><p>Very little movie production footage is easily available out there in 4K, but this is one of the exceptions. The full theatrical trailer for the movie in glorious Ultra HD, Why does this make the list? Well I think if you are wanting to see the benefits of 4K, then samples like the Ocean Footage one mentioned above really show off the technical prowess, but it is actual movies that most people will be wanting to use 4K kit for, and this gives you a very good indication of how much of an increase in clarity, detail and vibrancy can be gained by switching to 4K. The standard HD version of this trailer is readily available too, so this is something you could make a direct comparison with. The nature of the film, a sci-fi action film, also lends itself to 4K with lots of beautifully rendered CGI scenes in the trailer to look at.</p>
<h3 id="3-Timescapes"><a href="#3-Timescapes" class="headerlink" title="3. Timescapes"></a>3. Timescapes</h3><p>This is the trailer for an interesting project, filmed entirely in 4K and the work of one man, it is purported to be the first 4K film made available for sale. The film itself, and this trailer, is a simple concept, slow-motion and time lapse cinematography of the South West of America, taken as the director, Tom Lowe, travels around in his pickup truck. The concept itself makes for an interesting effect, but this sample is here because of the content. Watching the big expanses of nature flow by in 4K is simply mind blowing, here you really see the almost 3D effect so much resolution and detail bring to the medium, it isn’t like watching a video, it really is like looking out of a window at real life.</p>
<h3 id="4-Boat-Scenes"><a href="#4-Boat-Scenes" class="headerlink" title="4. Boat Scenes"></a>4. Boat Scenes</h3><p>There are actually several test videos on this subject, all of them do a good job of displaying 4K but for me it is the this one that focuses on passing boats against an expansive backdrop that is the one to look at. Again it shows the effect of 4K resolution when displaying the wider world around us, this time a harbor vista as the boat passes through it, detail can be seen in the water, the passengers on the boat and the backdrop, and the sense of realism and scale, which for me are the things that set 4K apart, are readily apparent here.</p>
<h3 id="5-Tears-of-Steel-trailer"><a href="#5-Tears-of-Steel-trailer" class="headerlink" title="5. Tears of Steel trailer"></a>5. Tears of Steel trailer</h3><p>Another rare 4K movie trailer, this one again shows lots of very high quality CGI that really show off the capabilities of 4K at their best. Some great use of the depth of field that 4K emphasizes in a lot of the shots and overall provides a great insight into 4K and what you can expect from it. An interesting video that also manages to tell a little story as well as being a showcase.</p>
<h3 id="6-Sintel"><a href="#6-Sintel" class="headerlink" title="6. Sintel"></a>6. Sintel</h3><p>Sintel is an animated short created in the blender animation program, here in 4K it represents a fantastic look into what 4K can offer all forms of media, the opening scene, with the snow blowing in the wind, for instance, enables you to see incredible detail that just isn’t visible within the standard HD version. Seeing individual flies as the character searches through the wreckage of a town is another high point in terms of technical prowess.</p>
<p>Another feature of Sintel is its soft focus look that accentuates the high resolution, and makes this video stand out from others in the list. The small dragon is well animated and the main characters features, particularly the hair, are incredibly well realized. A great way to showcase your 4K equipment.</p>
<h3 id="7-Stock-Footage-Sample"><a href="#7-Stock-Footage-Sample" class="headerlink" title="7. Stock Footage Sample"></a>7. Stock Footage Sample</h3><p>This one is an amalgam of short clips from commercial stock footage that is used a sample of the product. That doesn’t make it any less of a fantastic 4K clip however, with footage chosen specifically to show off the benefits of 4K at its very best (it is a promotional package after all) there is something here for everyone. From the glorious colors of a sunrise to the explosions and the amazing time lapse, with, again, fantastic and vibrant colors, a real showcase for 4K in the true sense of the word.</p>
<h3 id="8-Honey-Bees"><a href="#8-Honey-Bees" class="headerlink" title="8. Honey Bees"></a>8. Honey Bees</h3><p>Back to nature for this one, and the eponymous Honey Bee. Showing not only the color rendition and detail of the surroundings, it also captures the Bees themselves in incredible fidelity, the wing detail, especially on the close-ups, is just way beyond anything we have seen from moving images before, high resolution stills? Certainly, but not video. Another great advert for 4K footage and a lovely film as well.</p>
<h4 id="9-Skyfall-Trailer"><a href="#9-Skyfall-Trailer" class="headerlink" title="9. Skyfall Trailer"></a>9. Skyfall Trailer</h4><p>Can’t say I’m much of a fan of the films, but as a way to see what very fast action looks like in 4K this is a great one. Unlike the other movie trailers, this one isn’t full of CGI, so it shows a different aspect of 4K movies here, the real-life stunts performed by traditional stunt professionals is what this one is all about. And it doesn’t let us down, crashes, explosions and car chases, everything that Bond is about. Except in 4K. Great.</p>
<h4 id="10-Fireworks"><a href="#10-Fireworks" class="headerlink" title="10. Fireworks"></a>10. Fireworks</h4><p>This one is just a lot of fun. Fireworks, in 4K. Color rendition, detail, it has it all. It opens with a magnificent view across the city showing the lights at dusk and beyond, and then into the stunning firework display, it really is quite spectacular and a great look at 4K footage.</p>
<p>That’s our top 10, not all the best technically, but each offers something a little different to give a taste of what 4K is all about, and exactly what your 4K screen is capable of.</p>

<h4 id="1-Ocean-Footage-underwater-sample-1"><a href="#1-Ocean-Footage-underwater-sample-1" class="headerlink" title="1. Ocean Footage underwater sample"></a>1. Ocean Footage underwater sample</h4><p>This one is first on my choice of 4K video sample for a couple of reasons, firstly I love the subject matter, and secondly from a technical perspective it is one of the best samples out there.</p>
<p>Filmed using a Red One camera, it displays the vibrancy and detail that we associate with 4K resolution at its best, the color depth of the fish and coral is astounding, and when the shot moves to a passing whale the sense of scale the resolution gives really shows what 4K is capable of, and why it is a step up from anything we have seen before.</p>
<h4 id="2-Trailer-for-the-movie-‘Elysium’-1"><a href="#2-Trailer-for-the-movie-‘Elysium’-1" class="headerlink" title="2. Trailer for the movie ‘Elysium’"></a>2. Trailer for the movie ‘Elysium’</h4><p>Very little movie production footage is easily available out there in 4K, but this is one of the exceptions. The full theatrical trailer for the movie in glorious Ultra HD, Why does this make the list? Well I think if you are wanting to see the benefits of 4K, then samples like the Ocean Footage one mentioned above really show off the technical prowess, but it is actual movies that most people will be wanting to use 4K kit for, and this gives you a very good indication of how much of an increase in clarity, detail and vibrancy can be gained by switching to 4K. The standard HD version of this trailer is readily available too, so this is something you could make a direct comparison with. The nature of the film, a sci-fi action film, also lends itself to 4K with lots of beautifully rendered CGI scenes in the trailer to look at.</p>
<h3 id="3-Timescapes-1"><a href="#3-Timescapes-1" class="headerlink" title="3. Timescapes"></a>3. Timescapes</h3><p>This is the trailer for an interesting project, filmed entirely in 4K and the work of one man, it is purported to be the first 4K film made available for sale. The film itself, and this trailer, is a simple concept, slow-motion and time lapse cinematography of the South West of America, taken as the director, Tom Lowe, travels around in his pickup truck. The concept itself makes for an interesting effect, but this sample is here because of the content. Watching the big expanses of nature flow by in 4K is simply mind blowing, here you really see the almost 3D effect so much resolution and detail bring to the medium, it isn’t like watching a video, it really is like looking out of a window at real life.</p>
<h3 id="4-Boat-Scenes-1"><a href="#4-Boat-Scenes-1" class="headerlink" title="4. Boat Scenes"></a>4. Boat Scenes</h3><p>There are actually several test videos on this subject, all of them do a good job of displaying 4K but for me it is the this one that focuses on passing boats against an expansive backdrop that is the one to look at. Again it shows the effect of 4K resolution when displaying the wider world around us, this time a harbor vista as the boat passes through it, detail can be seen in the water, the passengers on the boat and the backdrop, and the sense of realism and scale, which for me are the things that set 4K apart, are readily apparent here.</p>
<h3 id="5-Tears-of-Steel-trailer-1"><a href="#5-Tears-of-Steel-trailer-1" class="headerlink" title="5. Tears of Steel trailer"></a>5. Tears of Steel trailer</h3><p>Another rare 4K movie trailer, this one again shows lots of very high quality CGI that really show off the capabilities of 4K at their best. Some great use of the depth of field that 4K emphasizes in a lot of the shots and overall provides a great insight into 4K and what you can expect from it. An interesting video that also manages to tell a little story as well as being a showcase.</p>
<h3 id="6-Sintel-1"><a href="#6-Sintel-1" class="headerlink" title="6. Sintel"></a>6. Sintel</h3><p>Sintel is an animated short created in the blender animation program, here in 4K it represents a fantastic look into what 4K can offer all forms of media, the opening scene, with the snow blowing in the wind, for instance, enables you to see incredible detail that just isn’t visible within the standard HD version. Seeing individual flies as the character searches through the wreckage of a town is another high point in terms of technical prowess.</p>
<p>Another feature of Sintel is its soft focus look that accentuates the high resolution, and makes this video stand out from others in the list. The small dragon is well animated and the main characters features, particularly the hair, are incredibly well realized. A great way to showcase your 4K equipment.</p>
<h3 id="7-Stock-Footage-Sample-1"><a href="#7-Stock-Footage-Sample-1" class="headerlink" title="7. Stock Footage Sample"></a>7. Stock Footage Sample</h3><p>This one is an amalgam of short clips from commercial stock footage that is used a sample of the product. That doesn’t make it any less of a fantastic 4K clip however, with footage chosen specifically to show off the benefits of 4K at its very best (it is a promotional package after all) there is something here for everyone. From the glorious colors of a sunrise to the explosions and the amazing time lapse, with, again, fantastic and vibrant colors, a real showcase for 4K in the true sense of the word.</p>
<h3 id="8-Honey-Bees-1"><a href="#8-Honey-Bees-1" class="headerlink" title="8. Honey Bees"></a>8. Honey Bees</h3><p>Back to nature for this one, and the eponymous Honey Bee. Showing not only the color rendition and detail of the surroundings, it also captures the Bees themselves in incredible fidelity, the wing detail, especially on the close-ups, is just way beyond anything we have seen from moving images before, high resolution stills? Certainly, but not video. Another great advert for 4K footage and a lovely film as well.</p>
<h4 id="9-Skyfall-Trailer-1"><a href="#9-Skyfall-Trailer-1" class="headerlink" title="9. Skyfall Trailer"></a>9. Skyfall Trailer</h4><p>Can’t say I’m much of a fan of the films, but as a way to see what very fast action looks like in 4K this is a great one. Unlike the other movie trailers, this one isn’t full of CGI, so it shows a different aspect of 4K movies here, the real-life stunts performed by traditional stunt professionals is what this one is all about. And it doesn’t let us down, crashes, explosions and car chases, everything that Bond is about. Except in 4K. Great.</p>
<h4 id="10-Fireworks-1"><a href="#10-Fireworks-1" class="headerlink" title="10. Fireworks"></a>10. Fireworks</h4><p>This one is just a lot of fun. Fireworks, in 4K. Color rendition, detail, it has it all. It opens with a magnificent view across the city showing the lights at dusk and beyond, and then into the stunning firework display, it really is quite spectacular and a great look at 4K footage.</p>
<p>That’s our top 10, not all the best technically, but each offers something a little different to give a taste of what 4K is all about, and exactly what your 4K screen is capable of.</p>

<h4 id="1-Ocean-Footage-underwater-sample-3"><a href="#1-Ocean-Footage-underwater-sample-3" class="headerlink" title="1. Ocean Footage underwater sample"></a>1. Ocean Footage underwater sample</h4><p>This one is first on my choice of 4K video sample for a couple of reasons, firstly I love the subject matter, and secondly from a technical perspective it is one of the best samples out there.</p>
<p>Filmed using a Red One camera, it displays the vibrancy and detail that we associate with 4K resolution at its best, the color depth of the fish and coral is astounding, and when the shot moves to a passing whale the sense of scale the resolution gives really shows what 4K is capable of, and why it is a step up from anything we have seen before.</p>
<h4 id="2-Trailer-for-the-movie-‘Elysium’-3"><a href="#2-Trailer-for-the-movie-‘Elysium’-3" class="headerlink" title="2. Trailer for the movie ‘Elysium’"></a>2. Trailer for the movie ‘Elysium’</h4><p>Very little movie production footage is easily available out there in 4K, but this is one of the exceptions. The full theatrical trailer for the movie in glorious Ultra HD, Why does this make the list? Well I think if you are wanting to see the benefits of 4K, then samples like the Ocean Footage one mentioned above really show off the technical prowess, but it is actual movies that most people will be wanting to use 4K kit for, and this gives you a very good indication of how much of an increase in clarity, detail and vibrancy can be gained by switching to 4K. The standard HD version of this trailer is readily available too, so this is something you could make a direct comparison with. The nature of the film, a sci-fi action film, also lends itself to 4K with lots of beautifully rendered CGI scenes in the trailer to look at.</p>
<h3 id="3-Timescapes-3"><a href="#3-Timescapes-3" class="headerlink" title="3. Timescapes"></a>3. Timescapes</h3><p>This is the trailer for an interesting project, filmed entirely in 4K and the work of one man, it is purported to be the first 4K film made available for sale. The film itself, and this trailer, is a simple concept, slow-motion and time lapse cinematography of the South West of America, taken as the director, Tom Lowe, travels around in his pickup truck. The concept itself makes for an interesting effect, but this sample is here because of the content. Watching the big expanses of nature flow by in 4K is simply mind blowing, here you really see the almost 3D effect so much resolution and detail bring to the medium, it isn’t like watching a video, it really is like looking out of a window at real life.</p>
<h3 id="4-Boat-Scenes-3"><a href="#4-Boat-Scenes-3" class="headerlink" title="4. Boat Scenes"></a>4. Boat Scenes</h3><p>There are actually several test videos on this subject, all of them do a good job of displaying 4K but for me it is the this one that focuses on passing boats against an expansive backdrop that is the one to look at. Again it shows the effect of 4K resolution when displaying the wider world around us, this time a harbor vista as the boat passes through it, detail can be seen in the water, the passengers on the boat and the backdrop, and the sense of realism and scale, which for me are the things that set 4K apart, are readily apparent here.</p>
<h3 id="5-Tears-of-Steel-trailer-3"><a href="#5-Tears-of-Steel-trailer-3" class="headerlink" title="5. Tears of Steel trailer"></a>5. Tears of Steel trailer</h3><p>Another rare 4K movie trailer, this one again shows lots of very high quality CGI that really show off the capabilities of 4K at their best. Some great use of the depth of field that 4K emphasizes in a lot of the shots and overall provides a great insight into 4K and what you can expect from it. An interesting video that also manages to tell a little story as well as being a showcase.</p>
<h3 id="6-Sintel-3"><a href="#6-Sintel-3" class="headerlink" title="6. Sintel"></a>6. Sintel</h3><p>Sintel is an animated short created in the blender animation program, here in 4K it represents a fantastic look into what 4K can offer all forms of media, the opening scene, with the snow blowing in the wind, for instance, enables you to see incredible detail that just isn’t visible within the standard HD version. Seeing individual flies as the character searches through the wreckage of a town is another high point in terms of technical prowess.</p>
<p>Another feature of Sintel is its soft focus look that accentuates the high resolution, and makes this video stand out from others in the list. The small dragon is well animated and the main characters features, particularly the hair, are incredibly well realized. A great way to showcase your 4K equipment.</p>
<h3 id="7-Stock-Footage-Sample-3"><a href="#7-Stock-Footage-Sample-3" class="headerlink" title="7. Stock Footage Sample"></a>7. Stock Footage Sample</h3><p>This one is an amalgam of short clips from commercial stock footage that is used a sample of the product. That doesn’t make it any less of a fantastic 4K clip however, with footage chosen specifically to show off the benefits of 4K at its very best (it is a promotional package after all) there is something here for everyone. From the glorious colors of a sunrise to the explosions and the amazing time lapse, with, again, fantastic and vibrant colors, a real showcase for 4K in the true sense of the word.</p>
<h3 id="8-Honey-Bees-3"><a href="#8-Honey-Bees-3" class="headerlink" title="8. Honey Bees"></a>8. Honey Bees</h3><p>Back to nature for this one, and the eponymous Honey Bee. Showing not only the color rendition and detail of the surroundings, it also captures the Bees themselves in incredible fidelity, the wing detail, especially on the close-ups, is just way beyond anything we have seen from moving images before, high resolution stills? Certainly, but not video. Another great advert for 4K footage and a lovely film as well.</p>
<h4 id="9-Skyfall-Trailer-3"><a href="#9-Skyfall-Trailer-3" class="headerlink" title="9. Skyfall Trailer"></a>9. Skyfall Trailer</h4><p>Can’t say I’m much of a fan of the films, but as a way to see what very fast action looks like in 4K this is a great one. Unlike the other movie trailers, this one isn’t full of CGI, so it shows a different aspect of 4K movies here, the real-life stunts performed by traditional stunt professionals is what this one is all about. And it doesn’t let us down, crashes, explosions and car chases, everything that Bond is about. Except in 4K. Great.</p>
<h4 id="10-Fireworks-3"><a href="#10-Fireworks-3" class="headerlink" title="10. Fireworks"></a>10. Fireworks</h4><p>This one is just a lot of fun. Fireworks, in 4K. Color rendition, detail, it has it all. It opens with a magnificent view across the city showing the lights at dusk and beyond, and then into the stunning firework display, it really is quite spectacular and a great look at 4K footage.</p>
<p>That’s our top 10, not all the best technically, but each offers something a little different to give a taste of what 4K is all about, and exactly what your 4K screen is capable of.</p>
