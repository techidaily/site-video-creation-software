**Pros**: JayCut does all you could imagine in a single web page. Actually, it amazes me and my friends. I like everything about this website. It is very user friendly and allows you to upload different types of media very quickly, and then mix them together.

The profile makes it a fun way of learning about other people and it can be fun because it is similar to Facebook or Myspace.
