### 01What Does OGG Means?

OGG is a file format that was developed by the Xiph Foundation, specifically for encoding audio and video file types. It is freely available and open-source. This format can be used by anyone with the right skills and knowledge. Additionally, file formats like this can contain not only the audio data but also video, text (like subtitles), and metadata related to the audio. It is a credit to the word 'Jargon,' which is slang for slang used on the computer game Netrek.

### 02Is OGG Better Than MP3?

OGG (or Open Source Graphics) is a popular audio file format. These are often preferred over MP3 as the files are easily readable and can have equal quality thru conversions. For better understanding, let's have a look at other related details for both MP3 and OGG:-

**●** Both OGG & MP3 are compressed formats, but they have distinct differences. OGG files are smaller and less lossy, you will get higher quality with OGG files, and sometimes you can hear the difference even under close-to-same levels of compression.

**●** OGG is a file format that can only be developed by resource-rich companies. But it has huge benefits, such as being free, open, and owned by the public.

**●** OGG is an audio codec that uses a variable bit rate, which enables it to preserve bandwidth.

**●** MP3 is right up there with other formats when it comes to quality and size, but the OGG format compresses files into smaller sizes and maintains a better quality than the MP3 file.

**●** OGG files have a bit rate of several hundred Kbps, whereas MP3 format only reaches up to 320 Kbps. The difference, however, should not be too big of a concern.

### 03How to Play OGG Files?

Different formats are available in which you can convert OGG like MP4, WEBM and AVI and so on. The reason behind doing the conversion is that devices do not allow users to play the content directly due to the lack of features in them.

02 [Eight Online and Free OGG to MP4 Converter](#Part 2)

## Part 1 What is OGG?

### 01What Does OGG Means?

OGG is a file format that was developed by the Xiph Foundation, specifically for encoding audio and video file types. It is freely available and open-source. This format can be used by anyone with the right skills and knowledge. Additionally, file formats like this can contain not only the audio data but also video, text (like subtitles), and metadata related to the audio. It is a credit to the word 'Jargon,' which is slang for slang used on the computer game Netrek.

### 02Is OGG Better Than MP3?

OGG (or Open Source Graphics) is a popular audio file format. These are often preferred over MP3 as the files are easily readable and can have equal quality thru conversions. For better understanding, let's have a look at other related details for both MP3 and OGG:-

**●** Both OGG & MP3 are compressed formats, but they have distinct differences. OGG files are smaller and less lossy, you will get higher quality with OGG files, and sometimes you can hear the difference even under close-to-same levels of compression.

**●** OGG is a file format that can only be developed by resource-rich companies. But it has huge benefits, such as being free, open, and owned by the public.

**●** OGG is an audio codec that uses a variable bit rate, which enables it to preserve bandwidth.

**●** MP3 is right up there with other formats when it comes to quality and size, but the OGG format compresses files into smaller sizes and maintains a better quality than the MP3 file.

**●** OGG files have a bit rate of several hundred Kbps, whereas MP3 format only reaches up to 320 Kbps. The difference, however, should not be too big of a concern.

### 03How to Play OGG Files?

When you are looking forward to playing the OGG files, it is important to convert them. Most devices available do not support the file format, due to which you cannot play them directly. Maybe the operating system at which you are using the device may support it but if it is not, look out for converter tools.

### 04Which Other Formats OGG Can Be Converted into and Why

Different formats are available in which you can convert OGG like MP4, WEBM and AVI and so on. The reason behind doing the conversion is that devices do not allow users to play the content directly due to the lack of features in them.

With several video-sharing platforms and billions of videos on those platforms, it is very difficult and competitive to make your mark and have an identity. There are hundreds of categories of videos that you can find on the platforms like Youtube, Dailymotion, Vimeo, and more. Among all those categories, reaction videos are one of the most popular categories. It allows a person to review another person's opinion, view, or idea about any particular issue or instance. Most of the video-sharing platforms enable their users to make all kinds of reaction videos without any restriction. Having such a huge competition makes it hard to stand out and attract viewers.

Have you ever seen videos where the reactor has a transparent background instead of the rectangle box in the corner? They look nice and engaging, right? The process of making such videos will require so many materials such as a green screen, stand, and other materials to support it. It is difficult for everyone to afford all these and secondly, it is very difficult to carry from one place to another.

![make-reaction-video-ai-portrait-step4](https://images.wondershare.com/filmora/article-images/make-reaction-video-ai-portrait-step4.png)

**Step 05:** Our goal is to remove the background of the reaction. To do that, we will use Human Segmentation. Drag and drop Human Segmentation into the reaction video. If you haven't purchased this effect already, it will ask you to buy it to export the video. But you want to try it first, click on "Try It."

![make-reaction-video-ai-portrait-step5](https://images.wondershare.com/filmora/article-images/make-reaction-video-ai-portrait-step5.png)

**Step 06:** Once the effect is successfully applied to the video, its background will be removed automatically.

![make-reaction-video-ai-portrait-step6](https://images.wondershare.com/filmora/article-images/make-reaction-video-ai-portrait-step6.png)

**Step 07:** Adjust the video by making it smaller and place it in the bottom left corner of the screen. Your reaction video is ready to be uploaded on video-sharing platforms.

![make-reaction-video-ai-portrait-step7](https://images.wondershare.com/filmora/article-images/make-reaction-video-ai-portrait-step7.png)

**Step 08:** To make your video look cool and stunning, you can also add multiple other effects to your reaction. AI portrait allows you to add a border around the character to make it look more visible and separate it from another video. Go to the AI portrait and drag Human Border Effect and drop it into your reaction. It will create an outline around the character and make it look more visible.

![make-reaction-video-ai-portrait-step8](https://images.wondershare.com/filmora/article-images/make-reaction-video-ai-portrait-step8.png)

**Step 09:** In some instances, you might need to change the position or size of your reaction. You can easily do that by applying the Keyframes to it. If you feel like changing the part of your reaction at some point in the video, go to that point in the timeline and click on the keyframe button above the timeline.

![make-reaction-video-ai-portrait-step9](https://images.wondershare.com/filmora/article-images/make-reaction-video-ai-portrait-step9.png)

**Step 10:** Once you click on the keyframe, it will add a keyframe to the video. Now move forward into the timeline to a point and adjust your character's position by dragging it. Let's move it to the bottom right corner. It will add another keyframe to the video in the timeline. Now the character will change its position from the left corner to the right corner once it reaches that specific point in time.
