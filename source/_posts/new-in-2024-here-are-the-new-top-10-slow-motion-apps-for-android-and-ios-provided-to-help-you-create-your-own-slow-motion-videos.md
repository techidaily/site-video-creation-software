## Streamline Your Workflow: Top Adobe Premiere Shortcuts You Need

# Top 20 Adobe Premiere Shortcuts You Will Use When Editing Video Files

![author avatar](https://images.wondershare.com/filmora/article-images/benjamin-arango-author.jpg)

##### Benjamin Arango

 Mar 27, 2024• Proven solutions

 Whilst the conventional mouse control allows you to perform any task that Premiere is capable of, for efficient workflow the keyboard shortcuts cannot be beaten. We all work a little differently, and thankfully Adobe understands that, so although here we will be concentrating on the standard keyboard layout, the keyboard shortcuts can be customized to be anything you want and saved as a custom profile, there are even presets already included for Avid Media Composer and [Final Cut Pro](https://tools.techidaily.com/wondershare/filmora/download/) for those who are maybe transitioning from those packages or just prefer the way they work.

---

 This is a basic tutorial about Adobe Premiere, professional video editing software. However, if video editing is new to you, consider [Wondershare Filmora (originally Wondershare Video Editor)](https://tools.techidaily.com/wondershare/filmora/download/), which is a powerful but easy-to-use tool for users just starting out. Download the free trial version below.

[![Download Win Version](https://images.wondershare.com/filmora/guide/download-btn-win.jpg)](https://tools.techidaily.com/wondershare/filmora/download/)[Download Mac Version](https://images.wondershare.com/filmora/guide/download-btn-mac.jpg)](https://tools.techidaily.com/wondershare/filmora/download/)

---

 This is achieved by going through the path edit > keyboard shortcuts as below:

![Adobe Premiere Shortcut](https://images.wondershare.com/images/multimedia/video-editor/adobe-shortcut-1.jpg)

 Before we step into the most useful shortcuts, a brief note here on the different platforms, although I'm sure most readers are aware. The PC and Mac versions of the software do share the same basic shortcuts with the one caveat that where the PC uses the Control and Alt keys, the Mac has Command and Option keys instead. Other than that the functionality is the same. I'll include the shortcuts for both platforms with each to make referencing easier.

#### 1Select Window

 I'm starting with this one simply because I find it the most used of all, especially if like me you prefer a custom layout for all your windows. If your program monitor is hidden for instance, you can just press shift+4 and there it is. The shortcuts are the same for both platforms here.

* Audio Clip Mixer Shift+9
* Audio Track Mixer Shift+6
* Effect Controls Shift+5
* Effects Shift+7
* Media Browser Shift+8
* Program Monitor Shift+4
* Project Shift+1
* Source Monitor Shift+2
* Timelines Shift+3

#### 2 Import

 Whilst the shortcuts for editing and manipulating clips are extremely important for efficient workflow, it should be remembered that those relating to the basic operation of the program are just as useful, as we see here. Using Control and I (Command and I on Mac) brings up the import media dialogue box instantly.

![Adobe Premiere Shortcut](https://images.wondershare.com/images/multimedia/video-editor/adobe-shotcut-3.png)

#### 3Capture Panel

 There are multiple shortcuts that can be used within the capture panel, but because this is such an intrinsic aspect of the Premiere workflow, being the entry into a project for all media, I think the available shortcuts are all as valuable as each other here.

* Navigate Through Fields - Tab
* Cancel Capture - Esc
* Fast Forward - F
* Rewind - R
* Go to In Point - Q
* Go to Out Point - W
* Record - G
* Stop - S
* Step Back - Left Arrow
* Step Forward - Right Arrow

![Adobe Premiere Shortcut](https://images.wondershare.com/images/multimedia/video-editor/adobe-shotcut-2.jpg)

#### 4 Timeline Panel

 In a similar vein to the Capture Panel, the Timeline Panel has a set of shortcuts specific to all its basic operations, and are essential for a faster workflow.

* Clear Ins and Outs - G
* Clear In Point - D
* Clear Out Point - F
* Go to In Point- Q
* Go to Out Point - W
* Match Frame - M
* Start and Stop - Spacebar
* Play Normal Speed - L
* Play Reverse Normal Speed - J
* Set In Point - I
* Set Out Point - o
* Shuttle Stop - K
* Trim - T
* Arc Tool - A
* Ellipse Tool – E

![Adobe Premiere Shortcut](https://images.wondershare.com/images/multimedia/video-editor/adobe-shotcut-4.jpg)

#### 5 Navigation within a clip

 This one works within the program monitor/timeline or source monitor windows, ensure the desired one is active first of course. You can move to a specific time code within the clip, or go forwards or backwards a set number of frames using the number pad. To go to a specific time code simply type that on the number pad. To travel a set number of frames simply type + or – (to signify direction) and the number of frames.

#### 6Marking Clips

 By far the simplest way to mark clips is to use the keyboard shortcut.

 For marking clips use X , whilst marking a selection is / .

#### 7 In and Out

 In addition to marking clips via shortcuts, it is also far easier to mark In and Out points this way.

* To Mark In use I , whilst to mark Out use O .
* To Clear In the shortcut is Control+Shift+I for PC and Option+I for Mac.
* To Clear Out Control+Shift+O for PC, Option+O for Mac.

#### 8Playing Clips

 Going hand in hand with the shortcuts for marking, are the keyboard commands for playing clips. These are:

* Play In to Out: Control+Shift+Space (PC) and Option+K for Mac
* Clear In and Out: Control+Shift+X (PC) and Option+X for Mac
* Play Around: The same for both platforms and is Shift+K.

 To get the best from this it is necessary to set some options beforehand, as Play Around plays the portion of the timeline around the Playhead, and where it plays is dependent on the options set. This is done through the menu via edit > preferences > playback, here I have preroll and postroll set to 4 seconds, meaning that it plays 4 seconds prior and following the point where the playhead is placed.

![Adobe Premiere Shortcut](https://images.wondershare.com/images/multimedia/video-editor/adobe-shotcut-5.jpg)

 In addition, turning on looping for this can help to fine tune edits.

#### 9Toggle Audio During Scrubbing

 There are times you may want to hear audio when scrubbing, however turning it off can have beneficial effects on performance for lower end computers. The shortcut makes it an easy process to turn off and on as required.

 The shortcut is Shift+S for both platforms.

#### 10Slide a clip within the sequence

 There are a couple of options available here from the shortcuts, slide one frame or 5 frames.

* To slide one frame to the left is Alt+, for PC or Option+, for Mac. To increase to five frames add Shift to either shortcut.
* To slide one frame to the right is Alt+. for PC and Option+. for Mac. Again, to increase to five frames add Shift.

#### 11Slip within a sequence

 As with the slide options, the choice is one frame or five frames.

* To slip one frame to the left is Control+Alt+Left for PC or Option+Command+Left for Mac. To increase to five frames add Shift to either shortcut.
* To slip one frame to the right is Control+Alt+Right for PC and Option+Command+Right for Mac. Again, to increase to five frames add Shift.

#### 12Nudging

 You can move a clip up or down simply by using the Up and Down arrow keys, whilst holding Alt or Option at the same time allows you to select just the video or audio to move.

#### 13Multi Camera Selection

 This is a tool that allows you to work with multiple camera angles of the same subject or scene. To switch between different cameras quickly is extremely useful and accomplished with the numerical keys.

 Numbers 1 through 9 select the corresponding camera.

#### 14Add an edit

 This option cuts the track (or tracks) that are targeted. The shortcut for this is Control+K or Command+K.

 You can view all added edits within a sequence by selecting show through edits within the sequence menu.

![Adobe Premiere Shortcut](https://images.wondershare.com/images/multimedia/video-editor/adobe-shotcut-6.jpg)

#### 15Add the default Transition

 This option applies the default transition to all selected media. To do this use Shift+D.

#### 16 Match Frame

 Locating a specific frame within the sequence for adding in a second clip is very useful, the shortcut is M, a great timesaver.

#### 17Zoom to sequence

 Being able to zoom in is great, it makes working in the sequence panel much easier, at least for me, however the one drawback I find is that I tend to get lost when looking for a particular clip. Using / enable you to quickly zoom out for navigation and back in again to work

#### 18Jump to Edit

 Navigating from edit to edit is a very simple process with the shortcuts available to you.

 Page up takes you to the previous edit point, whilst page down takes you to the next.

 With practice these shortcuts become second nature and you will find your workflow becomes not only faster but a smoother operation as well.

#### 19Toggle the type of Trim used

 Quickly shift between Standard, Ripple and Roll trim types.

 Shift+T for PC, Control+T for Mac

#### 20Ripple Trim

 This enables you to trim the head or tail of the clip very quickly, making an extremely efficient workflow. To trim the next edit from the Playhead use W, for the previous edit from the playhead use Q.

#### 5 Navigation within a clip

 This one works within the program monitor/timeline or source monitor windows, ensure the desired one is active first of course. You can move to a specific time code within the clip, or go forwards or backwards a set number of frames using the number pad. To go to a specific time code simply type that on the number pad. To travel a set number of frames simply type + or – (to signify direction) and the number of frames.

#### 6Marking Clips

 By far the simplest way to mark clips is to use the keyboard shortcut.

 For marking clips use X , whilst marking a selection is / .

#### 7 In and Out

 In addition to marking clips via shortcuts, it is also far easier to mark In and Out points this way.

* To Mark In use I , whilst to mark Out use O .
* To Clear In the shortcut is Control+Shift+I for PC and Option+I for Mac.
* To Clear Out Control+Shift+O for PC, Option+O for Mac.

#### 8Playing Clips

 Going hand in hand with the shortcuts for marking, are the keyboard commands for playing clips. These are:

* Play In to Out: Control+Shift+Space (PC) and Option+K for Mac
* Clear In and Out: Control+Shift+X (PC) and Option+X for Mac
* Play Around: The same for both platforms and is Shift+K.

 To get the best from this it is necessary to set some options beforehand, as Play Around plays the portion of the timeline around the Playhead, and where it plays is dependent on the options set. This is done through the menu via edit > preferences > playback, here I have preroll and postroll set to 4 seconds, meaning that it plays 4 seconds prior and following the point where the playhead is placed.

![Adobe Premiere Shortcut](https://images.wondershare.com/images/multimedia/video-editor/adobe-shotcut-5.jpg)

 In addition, turning on looping for this can help to fine tune edits.

#### 9Toggle Audio During Scrubbing

 There are times you may want to hear audio when scrubbing, however turning it off can have beneficial effects on performance for lower end computers. The shortcut makes it an easy process to turn off and on as required.

 The shortcut is Shift+S for both platforms.

#### 10Slide a clip within the sequence

 There are a couple of options available here from the shortcuts, slide one frame or 5 frames.

* To slide one frame to the left is Alt+, for PC or Option+, for Mac. To increase to five frames add Shift to either shortcut.
* To slide one frame to the right is Alt+. for PC and Option+. for Mac. Again, to increase to five frames add Shift.

#### 11Slip within a sequence

 As with the slide options, the choice is one frame or five frames.

* To slip one frame to the left is Control+Alt+Left for PC or Option+Command+Left for Mac. To increase to five frames add Shift to either shortcut.
* To slip one frame to the right is Control+Alt+Right for PC and Option+Command+Right for Mac. Again, to increase to five frames add Shift.

#### 12Nudging

 You can move a clip up or down simply by using the Up and Down arrow keys, whilst holding Alt or Option at the same time allows you to select just the video or audio to move.

#### 13Multi Camera Selection

 This is a tool that allows you to work with multiple camera angles of the same subject or scene. To switch between different cameras quickly is extremely useful and accomplished with the numerical keys.

 Numbers 1 through 9 select the corresponding camera.

#### 14Add an edit

 This option cuts the track (or tracks) that are targeted. The shortcut for this is Control+K or Command+K.

 You can view all added edits within a sequence by selecting show through edits within the sequence menu.

![Adobe Premiere Shortcut](https://images.wondershare.com/images/multimedia/video-editor/adobe-shotcut-6.jpg)

#### 15Add the default Transition

 This option applies the default transition to all selected media. To do this use Shift+D.

#### 16 Match Frame

 Locating a specific frame within the sequence for adding in a second clip is very useful, the shortcut is M, a great timesaver.

#### 17Zoom to sequence

 Being able to zoom in is great, it makes working in the sequence panel much easier, at least for me, however the one drawback I find is that I tend to get lost when looking for a particular clip. Using / enable you to quickly zoom out for navigation and back in again to work

#### 18Jump to Edit

 Navigating from edit to edit is a very simple process with the shortcuts available to you.

 Page up takes you to the previous edit point, whilst page down takes you to the next.

 With practice these shortcuts become second nature and you will find your workflow becomes not only faster but a smoother operation as well.

#### 19Toggle the type of Trim used

 Quickly shift between Standard, Ripple and Roll trim types.

 Shift+T for PC, Control+T for Mac

#### 20Ripple Trim

 This enables you to trim the head or tail of the clip very quickly, making an extremely efficient workflow. To trim the next edit from the Playhead use W, for the previous edit from the playhead use Q.

 Whilst the conventional mouse control allows you to perform any task that Premiere is capable of, for efficient workflow the keyboard shortcuts cannot be beaten. We all work a little differently, and thankfully Adobe understands that, so although here we will be concentrating on the standard keyboard layout, the keyboard shortcuts can be customized to be anything you want and saved as a custom profile, there are even presets already included for Avid Media Composer and [Final Cut Pro](https://tools.techidaily.com/wondershare/filmora/download/) for those who are maybe transitioning from those packages or just prefer the way they work.

---

 This is a basic tutorial about Adobe Premiere, professional video editing software. However, if video editing is new to you, consider [Wondershare Filmora (originally Wondershare Video Editor)](https://tools.techidaily.com/wondershare/filmora/download/), which is a powerful but easy-to-use tool for users just starting out. Download the free trial version below.

[![Download Win Version](https://images.wondershare.com/filmora/guide/download-btn-win.jpg)](https://tools.techidaily.com/wondershare/filmora/download/)[Download Mac Version](https://images.wondershare.com/filmora/guide/download-btn-mac.jpg)](https://tools.techidaily.com/wondershare/filmora/download/)

---

 This is achieved by going through the path edit > keyboard shortcuts as below:

![Adobe Premiere Shortcut](https://images.wondershare.com/images/multimedia/video-editor/adobe-shortcut-1.jpg)

 Before we step into the most useful shortcuts, a brief note here on the different platforms, although I'm sure most readers are aware. The PC and Mac versions of the software do share the same basic shortcuts with the one caveat that where the PC uses the Control and Alt keys, the Mac has Command and Option keys instead. Other than that the functionality is the same. I'll include the shortcuts for both platforms with each to make referencing easier.

#### 1Select Window

 I'm starting with this one simply because I find it the most used of all, especially if like me you prefer a custom layout for all your windows. If your program monitor is hidden for instance, you can just press shift+4 and there it is. The shortcuts are the same for both platforms here.

* Audio Clip Mixer Shift+9
* Audio Track Mixer Shift+6
* Effect Controls Shift+5
* Effects Shift+7
* Media Browser Shift+8
* Program Monitor Shift+4
* Project Shift+1
* Source Monitor Shift+2
* Timelines Shift+3

#### 2 Import

 Whilst the shortcuts for editing and manipulating clips are extremely important for efficient workflow, it should be remembered that those relating to the basic operation of the program are just as useful, as we see here. Using Control and I (Command and I on Mac) brings up the import media dialogue box instantly.

![Adobe Premiere Shortcut](https://images.wondershare.com/images/multimedia/video-editor/adobe-shotcut-3.png)

#### 3Capture Panel

 There are multiple shortcuts that can be used within the capture panel, but because this is such an intrinsic aspect of the Premiere workflow, being the entry into a project for all media, I think the available shortcuts are all as valuable as each other here.

* Navigate Through Fields - Tab
* Cancel Capture - Esc
* Fast Forward - F
* Rewind - R
* Go to In Point - Q
* Go to Out Point - W
* Record - G
* Stop - S
* Step Back - Left Arrow
* Step Forward - Right Arrow

![Adobe Premiere Shortcut](https://images.wondershare.com/images/multimedia/video-editor/adobe-shotcut-2.jpg)

#### 4 Timeline Panel

 In a similar vein to the Capture Panel, the Timeline Panel has a set of shortcuts specific to all its basic operations, and are essential for a faster workflow.

* Clear Ins and Outs - G
* Clear In Point - D
* Clear Out Point - F
* Go to In Point- Q
* Go to Out Point - W
* Match Frame - M
* Start and Stop - Spacebar
* Play Normal Speed - L
* Play Reverse Normal Speed - J
* Set In Point - I
* Set Out Point - o
* Shuttle Stop - K
* Trim - T
* Arc Tool - A
* Ellipse Tool – E

Watching the time pass by in front of our eyes is mesmerizing. The fast forwarded scenes of beautiful sunsets, busy streets and all other types of vistas can be found anywhere from Holywood movies to YouTube videos. You don’t need professional camera equipment if you want to create time-lapse videos you can share on your social media accounts because there are plenty of apps that let you create these types of videos directly from your Smartphones. So, in this article, we are going to introduce you to some of the best time-lapse apps for iPhone and Android devices in 2020.

## Best Time-Lapse Apps for Android and iPhone Devices in 2021

The quality of your time-lapse video doesn’t depend only on the number of tools an app offers, which is why you must do everything in your power to record the footage that doesn’t contain camera shakes or any other common mistakes. With that being said, let’s take a look at the five best time-lapse apps you can find on GooglePlay or on the AppStore.

#### 1. [Microsoft Hyperlapse Mobile](https://play.google.com/store/apps/details?id=com.microsoft.hyperlapsemobile&hl=en)

**Price:** Free

**Compatibility:** Android 4.4 or later

**Rating:** 4.2

This Android-based application makes the creation of time-lapse videos look easy. You just have to select the speed at which you want to record a video, choose between 720p and 1080p resolutions and hit the record button. The app lets you increase the video’s speed up to 32 times, enabling you to create seamless time-lapses, although the video stabilization feature is only available if you’re recording a video at a normal speed. That is why you must ensure that your phone is perfectly stable while the recording is in progress if you want to create a smooth time-lapse. Microsoft Hyperlapse Mobile lets you share your creations on Instagram, Facebook, and other popular social media networks or save the time-lapse you’ve created to your phone’s SD card.

#### 2. [Slo Mo time lapse vid edit.or](https://itunes.apple.com/us/app/slo-mo-time-lapse-vid-edit-or/id1198548115?mt=8)

**Price:** Free, but offers in-app purchases

**Compatibility:** iOS 9.0 or later

**Rating:** 4.1

This is a video editing app that doesn’t offer video recording options.

Besides creating slow motion and time-lapse videos, you can also use this app to enhance the colors in the footage you’re editing, crop or trim video clips and add customized text overlays to the videos. The app also features a wide spectrum of filters and allows you to add sound effects or music to the video you’re working on. Keep in mind that you have to make an in-app purchase if you want to remove the watermark from your videos or if you want to export your time-lapse and slow-motion videos in Full HD resolution.

#### 3. [Lapse It Pro](https://itunes.apple.com/us/app/lapse-it-pro-time-lapse-stop-motion-camera-professional-hd/id536495161?mt=8&ign-mpt=uo%3D8)

You no longer need professional cameras, tripods, and [video editors](https://tools.techidaily.com/wondershare/filmora/download/) to create seamless time-lapse videos that depict the passage of time at a certain location. Instead, you can just download an iOS or Android-based app that enables you to have complete creative control over the process of capturing time-lapse videos and share them with your friends on social media.

Adding **Final Cut Pro subtitles and captions** is a great thing to expand your audience base, and thus the trend of adding captions and subtitles is becoming relevant day by day. There is a whole process to add Final Cut Pro captions and subtitles, which we are going to discuss below.

Let's check if there is any difference between captions and subtitles used in FCPX. Even though both these texts tend to appear at the bottom of the video screen, they have different purposes.

As we all know, subtitles depict foreign languages other than the language shown in the actual video. So, they are used to appearing on-screen frequently as the speaker speaks.

On the other hand, the captions display every kind of audio information, including sound effects, music, and background noises [(see how to remove background noise in FCPX here)](https://filmora.wondershare.com/final-cut-pro/remove-background-noise.html). Every Caption represents that viewer hasn't any audio clues and thus displays them over the video.

Every Caption represents that viewer hasn't any audio clues and thus displays them over the video.

## Part 1: How to Add Subtitles/Captions in Final Cut Pro X?

Before you study the steps required to add subtitles to Final Cut Pro, here are some quick facts about the format of captions supported by FCPX.

* **ITT (iTunes Timed Text)**

It is required to deliver the contents of Caption to the iTunes store.

* **CEA-608 (SCC)**

It is a standard caption format for web videos and broadcasts.

* **SRT (SubRip)**

It is a simple and popular format used in online videos.

### Steps to Add Subtitles or Captions in FCPX

**Step 1: Create Caption Roles**

You need first to create caption roles to start adding captions to the timeline. Go to **Modify** \> **Edit Roles** and then select **Captions**. Then, select CEA-608, choose your language, and hit the Apply button.

**Step 2: Add Captions**

Position the playhead to where you have to set the Caption in the timeline. You need to hit the **Edit** tab and then select **Captions** \> **Add Caption**.

Select the drop-down menu across the language and select **CEA-608**.

Now, you can add captions in the preview window or the **Captions Text** given alongside.

Also, you can adjust the duration of the Caption by dragging it in the timeline.

**Step 3: Export a Caption Role**

Press **Command + E** or go to **File** \> **Export** to open the **Export** preview window. Now, you can select the name and save your video in standard export options. Hit the **Roles** tab given at the top.

Then, click the small **Captions** icon to reveal the menu. Select the subtitles or captions to import alongside the **Burn in Captions** tab. Hit the **OK** button and proceed with export as usual.

Thus, similar steps are required even if you want to add subtitles.
