## How to Reset Final Cut Pro X?

Final Cut Pro X can be really exciting to use if you also get to know the solutions to reset the video editing tool. There can be several reasons as listed above due to which you may require resetting the tool. Here are a few common methods that can fix the problems and reset the software tool as a whole. We have explained the methods with the help of screenshots for your better understanding.

### Method 1: Locating the Preferences

You will require locating the preferences when the Final Cut Pro X keeps crashing. Usually, this program has five different locations where it stores preferences and settings, and that’s from where you can delete the right ones. Located in the library folder, you will find a sub-category of the root level library preferences folder containing the Final Cut Pro System Support folder.

The custom settings folder will contain the presets which you will have to delete. As soon as you find the right folder, you can begin trashing. You can drag the folders to the Trash and empty them then re-open the Final Cut Pro X to see if the problem is settled. If it isn’t, try deleting some more and keep checking the software tool.

### Method 2: Deleting Render Files

Do remember to save your important files before you do this. [Click here to see How to Save Final Cut Pro Project the Right Way？](https://tools.techidaily.com/wondershare/filmora/download/)

This can come in handy when your timeline does not share or render, or simply crash during playback of the rendered area. These render files in Final Cut Pro X seem to be particularly vulnerable to corruption. If you face any troubles during export or rendering, you should instead delete them in the first place. It should be your first action. In order to successfully do so, you can select the project in the browser and choose the file. After that, you can delete the generated project files.

You can begin deleting the files with just a few unused items, but if you feel that you face more trouble you can delete all the files instead. However, you will not have to delete optimized media or proxy. If the problem remains, you can delete the generated files from the Library or the event.

### Method 3: Transferring Events to a Fresh Library Folder

This method can be useful if the library corrupts. You should consider transferring your events to a freshly created Library. The majority of the time, this would resolve the problem. If you cannot open the Library, you can eliminate some specific generated items under the Library bundle’s root level. Ideally removing “Setting.plist” and “CurrentVersion.flexolibrary” are the safe options for removal, which can likely open the Library.

## Final Word

Final Cut Pro X can be a very helpful video editing tool until it acts up. Regardless of the reasons for a crashing program, you should consider implementing any of the aforementioned methods to reset the editor, troubleshoot the problems, and seamlessly edit your videos in the long run.

Do you enjoy the view of movies? Do you find your videos dull and unexciting? How about giving a cinematic look to your videos?

I bet a lot of editors have been there. However, it won’t take you long to find out that movies are quite different from the video you recorded and edited.

No worries, this article explains why there are differences between self-made videos and movies, as well as simple yet detailed steps to make cinematic look videos with FCPX.

> * [Part 1: Difference between a Cinematic Look and a Normal Video?](#part1)
> * [Part 2: How to Make a Cinematic Look Film Video with FCPX?](#part2)
> * [Part 3: What Other Factors Contribute to Film-Look Videos?](#part3)
> * [Part 4: How to Add Cinematic Look to Your Footage in easy ways?](#part4)

## **Part 1: Difference between a Cinematic Look and a Normal Video?**

The term cinematic is often referred to the black bars or wide-screen frame ratios. Photographers and filmmakers use the term cinematic to describe the look of movies and pictures shot on film.

However, the term has changed its meaning with the advent of digital video and the invention of high-tech devices. With the evolution of the internet across the globe, YouTubers, videographers, and social media influencers have started using this term to describe anything related to cinema and film. In other words, a cinematic look is an unconventional, film-look, and professional appearance of a video that makes a normal clip look elegant and worth watching. [See the top 10 movies made by FCPX here.](https://tools.techidaily.com/wondershare/filmora/download/)

![Blade-Runner-2049-poster](https://images.wondershare.com/filmora/images/final-cut-pro/Blade-Runner-2049-poster.png)

So, here we draw a line between a normal video and the one with a cinematic look. In the latter, you adjust everything that is directly or indirectly linked to the quality of a video, including but not limited to **colors**, **appearance**, **light**, **motion**, **frame rate**, **composition**, and **camera** **movements**.

Resolution refers to the horizontal pixel count such as 2K (2.2 megapixels) or 4K (8.8 megapixels). Similarly, the frame rate defines the number of individual images or frames being displayed on the TV screen per second. The universally accepted film frame rate is 24 FPS, which is used to make high-definition videos. However, most TV broadcasts and shows are recorded at 30fps. [See more about FPS here](https://tools.techidaily.com/wondershare/filmora/download/).

Thanks to the advanced video editing tools and applications that have made it easier to capture a cinematic look or make HD cinematic look videos with basic camera setups. If you want to get your desired cinematic look, read the following section.

## Part 2: How to Make a Cinematic Look Film Video with FCPX?

The latest features and user-friendly dashboard of Final Cut Pro X allow users (even beginners) to add effects and increase the aesthetics of their videos. Follow these four simple steps to make a cinematic look high-resolution video with Final Cut Pro X.

**Step 1: 4K Resolution and Low Frame Rate**

To achieve ideal cinematic aesthetics, you need high-quality 4K resolution videos, awesome exposure, the right codec, and lighting. Hence, to start with, capture a high-quality 4K Canon RAW shot with the latest high-tech Canon Log 2 camera. You can also use other devices and choose different codecs and color profiles to get the best color grade.

![frame-rate](https://images.wondershare.com/filmora/images/final-cut-pro/frame-rate.png)

**Step 2: Color Grading and Color Correction**

After importing your footage, get ready for color corrections to address issues like conversions for LOG formats through white balance adjustments. Color corrections normalize the color of HD videos into a standard format. Here’s how you can do this:

1. Go to the Inspector Panel and select the Extended Function
2. Select the C-Log 2 conversion LUT

![color-grading](https://images.wondershare.com/filmora/images/final-cut-pro/color-grading.png)

1. Make minor exposure and white balance adjustments as per your scope
2. Select the Color Wheels and Color Mask features to custom select specific areas and colors
3. Adjust your color grade according to your requirements
4. Use Color Masking to improve the shadow’s appearance and warm-up mid-tones
5. You will get a strong color contrast in your footage.

**Step 3: Use Slow Motion at the Right Timing**

Final Cut Pro X allows its users to make both constant and variable speed changes without disturbing the audio’s pitch. By using slow-motion effects at the right timing, you can make your videos adorable and give them a cinematic look.

* Select your video and click on the Retiming button
* Tap on the Slow section

![slow-motion](https://images.wondershare.com/filmora/images/final-cut-pro/slow-motion.png)

* You will see multiple options to slow down the speed of your clip
* The smaller number will slow down your footage
* To apply custom retiming amounts, again click on the Retiming button and select the Custom option
* Custom the speed of your clip over 100% or less than 100% as you want
* After selecting a value, your selected clip will become longer on the timeline.

**Step 4: Adopt Film Grain to Make Film-look Videos**

Film grain overlays give your videos vintage and cinematic look. Follow these steps to use these film grains in Final Cut Pro X:

1. Import your footage and film grains downloaded from the internet and layer them into your timeline
2. Place the film grain on top of your clip
3. Select the clip and go to the FCPX blend mode dropdown menu located on the top-right of your screen
4. Click on the Overlay and adjust the opacity of the film grain overlay as required.

 ![filmgrain](https://images.wondershare.com/filmora/images/final-cut-pro/filmgrain.png)

## **Part 3: What Other Factors Contribute to Film-Look Videos**

While making cinematic-look videos, also considering the following factors:

**Framing**

While filming, one must be aware of the emotion to be captured in the frame. For this purpose, follow the “Rule of Thirds,” which means to divide your short into three horizontal and vertical sections and select the third shot to produce some effect.

**Tilt Shift**

Instead of shooting your clips with a UHD camera, you can add cinematic effect with the Tilt-shift feature by setting the focus of your video. For this purpose, right-click on the video, select Power Tool and check the box with the option Apply Tilt-shift to the clip. Use the slider to adjust the focus.

**Background Music**

Cinematic clips without background music seem to be unexciting and boring. Adding melodious background music makes your videos look more professional and enjoyable. You can add default music or your favorite music downloaded from the internet by clicking on the Music tab.

**Titles and Subtitles**

Adding subtitles to your videos can make them understandable for viewers who speak a different language. Click on Text/Credit in Filmora and select Subtitles to add subtitles to your video.

## **Part 4: How to Add Cinematic Look to Your Footage in Easy Ways**

Filmora is an advanced video editing tool developed by Wondershare. Its user-friendly and easy-to-understand interface makes it popular among beginners as well as professionals. And the best thing about Filmora is that the editor provides rich options of presets, effects, and filters to add a film look to your video.

Here’s how you can add a cinematic look to your footage with Filmora.

![filmora](https://images.wondershare.com/filmora/images/final-cut-pro/filmora.png)

![Blade-Runner-2049-poster](https://images.wondershare.com/filmora/images/final-cut-pro/Blade-Runner-2049-poster.png)

So, here we draw a line between a normal video and the one with a cinematic look. In the latter, you adjust everything that is directly or indirectly linked to the quality of a video, including but not limited to **colors**, **appearance**, **light**, **motion**, **frame rate**, **composition**, and **camera** **movements**.

Resolution refers to the horizontal pixel count such as 2K (2.2 megapixels) or 4K (8.8 megapixels). Similarly, the frame rate defines the number of individual images or frames being displayed on the TV screen per second. The universally accepted film frame rate is 24 FPS, which is used to make high-definition videos. However, most TV broadcasts and shows are recorded at 30fps. [See more about FPS here](https://tools.techidaily.com/wondershare/filmora/download/).

Thanks to the advanced video editing tools and applications that have made it easier to capture a cinematic look or make HD cinematic look videos with basic camera setups. If you want to get your desired cinematic look, read the following section.

Do you enjoy the view of movies? Do you find your videos dull and unexciting? How about giving a cinematic look to your videos?

I bet a lot of editors have been there. However, it won’t take you long to find out that movies are quite different from the video you recorded and edited.

No worries, this article explains why there are differences between self-made videos and movies, as well as simple yet detailed steps to make cinematic look videos with FCPX.

## **Part 1: Difference between a Cinematic Look and a Normal Video?**

The term cinematic is often referred to the black bars or wide-screen frame ratios. Photographers and filmmakers use the term cinematic to describe the look of movies and pictures shot on film.

However, the term has changed its meaning with the advent of digital video and the invention of high-tech devices. With the evolution of the internet across the globe, YouTubers, videographers, and social media influencers have started using this term to describe anything related to cinema and film. In other words, a cinematic look is an unconventional, film-look, and professional appearance of a video that makes a normal clip look elegant and worth watching.

Size, formats, and resolution… What are pixels exactly doing with it?

![pixel](https://images.wondershare.com/filmora/article-images/2021/how-to-calculate-pixel-calculator-ratio1.jpg)

So let's review some basics on pixel calculator ratio to create an easy life, your workflow more productive, and your photos of the ideal size for the intended purpose.

#### In this article

01 [What is Pixel Aspect Ratio?](#Part 1)

02 [How is Pixel Ratio Calculated?](#Part 2)

03 [Par (pixel Aspect Ratio) in Adobe Premiere Pro/Filmora?](#Part 3)

04 [Difference among Pixel Aspect Ratio, Display Aspect Ratio, and Storage Aspect Ratio](#Part 4)

05 [How Aspect Ratios Affect UI/UX Design?](#Part 5)

## Part 1 What is Pixel Aspect Ratio?

A digital image is not a single non-dividable thing. You’ll see that your photo is like a mosaic formed by small tiles if you zoom in far enough, which are known as pixels in photography.

The amount of these pixels and the way they are divided are the two elements that you’re required to take into account to know more about the resolution and **pixel** **calculator ratio**.

The Pixel Aspect Ratio is simply the latest way of defining the length of one side of a pixel in context to the length of the other.

Let's say the ratio is 1:1; each side of the pixel is the same length as the other, also known as a square in pixels.

If the ratio is 2:1, it means that one side is twice the length of the other.

**NOTE**: The 'Aspect Ratio' does not define the actual or exact length of the side of a pixel is, just its "relative" size of one side to the other. The actual length will depend on how much you shrink or stretch a photo when recreating it. But if the **Pixel Calculator Ratio** is 1:1, then the pixels will always be square irrespective of the size of that particular photo.

![pixel aspect ratio](https://images.wondershare.com/filmora/article-images/2021/how-to-calculate-pixel-calculator-ratio2.jpg)

## Part 2 How is Pixel Ratio Calculated?

You can use a **pixel ratio calculator** to calculate the pixels within a screen. So, we'd like to suggest a calculator by xwebtools.com.

Here, you can see tabs, namely the **Common Ratios** **Ratio Width**, **Ratio Height**, **Pixels Width**, and **Pixels Height**.

![xwebtools pixel ratio calculator](https://images.wondershare.com/filmora/article-images/2021/how-to-calculate-pixel-calculator-ratio3.jpg)

**How it works:**

This **pixel ratio calculator** converts pixel dimensions to aspect ratios. It is an online free tool that assists you in calculating the aspect ratio value of an object or a photo.

The conversion can be carried in both ways, aspect ratio to pixels and pixels to aspect ratio. This screen resolution calculator offers a powerful and simple tool that can convert the ratio of images to pixels resolution and pixels to ratio dimensions.

You need to provide Pixels Width and Pixels Height to calculate the aspect ratio; the aspect ratio will be automatically calculated.

You need to provide Ratio Height and Ratio Width to calculate pixel resolutions. Both the Pixels Width and Height will get automatically calculated.

## Part 3 What is Par (pixel Aspect Ratio) in Adobe Premiere Pro/Filmora?

**Pixel ratio: Adobe Premiere Pro**

As we already discussed, an aspect ratio defines width to height. The still picture and video frames have a frame aspect ratio. The pixels that create the frame have a pixel aspect ratio (sometimes called PAR).

Different video recording standards have different aspect ratios. For instance, you record video for television in either a 16:9 or a 4:3 frame aspect ratio.

You set the frame and pixel aspect when you create a project in Adobe Premiere Pro. Once you set these ratios, you can't change them for that project. However, you can edit the aspect ratio of a sequence. You can also use assets made with different aspect ratios in the project.

Premiere Pro automatically compensates for the pixel aspect ratio of source files.

If an asset still feels distorted, you can manually mention its pixel aspect ratio. But that isn't very clear, especially for a beginner. This is why we recommend doing the following.

**Pixel ratio: Wondershare Filmora**

You need a converter or a video editor to change the aspect ratio permanently. Here we humbly recommend an excellent aspect ratio changer - [Wondershare Filmora](https://tools.techidaily.com/wondershare/filmora/download/) video editor, which helps you make 4:3, 9:16, 16:9, and 1:1 aspect ratio videos pretty quickly.

**Method 5:** Change aspect ratio while Exporting

![exporting filmora](https://images.wondershare.com/filmora/article-images/2021/how-to-calculate-pixel-calculator-ratio8.jpg)

Thus, using the Wondershare Filmora along with the **pixel ratio calculator** makes a difference!

## Part 4 Difference among Pixel Aspect Ratio, Display Aspect Ratio, and Storage Aspect Ratio

Although the image aspect ratio comes from its width and height, it also contains multiple subsets that help to define image proportions properly.

1 - **Pixel aspect ratio**

Pixel aspect ratio (PAR) is the proportion of the specific pixels within an image. They are generally square within the pixel aspect ratio of 1:1.

But sometimes, specific images are optimized for certain types of displays. And, they have rectangular pixels with an aspect ratio of 4:3 or similar.

2 - **Display aspect ratio**

The display aspect ratio (DAR) is the designers' most frequent aspect ratio and gets generally synced with the general term.

As the name suggests, the display aspect ratio refers to the proportions of an image as it appears on different screens out there.

Some devices, such as televisions and cameras, have a fixed DAR for images to display nicely on these devices.

They need optimization for their specific or respective aspect ratio. For instance, a typical display aspect ratio for the widescreen video on a television screen or monitor screen is 16:9.

They appear distorted when images with different aspect ratios are presented on these devices. Digital SLR camera sensors also consist of a fixed display aspect ratio, which controls how pictures captured by the camera will be displayed and saved.

3 - **Storage aspect ratio**

Storage aspect ratio, commonly known as (SAR) is an aspect ratio formula that concerns specifically to encoded digital video files. SAR refers to the height and the width relationship in video frame size, and it is required to be consistent among all individual frames.

SAR x PAR = DAR for max widescreen videos in a usual used formula.

## Part 1 Part 5: How Aspect Ratios Affect UI/UX Design?

Aspect ratios play a vital part in any project that consists of displaying and capturing photographs, videos, or other image-based files in an ideal manner. The camera's fixed aspect ratio can considerably impact, especially for photographers.

And for videographers or anyone working with slideshows, animations, and other motion projects, the aspect ratio is a prominent element for correct display on mobile devices and widescreen.

But even in the environment of responsive web design, problems can arise, such as when an image is not adjustable for display without compromising its quality or content.

A small example is when you need a square image with a 1:1 aspect ratio to insert into a rectangular box on a web page. To accommodate varying image size requirements, proportions and size may need adjustment.

In an increasingly picture-driven digital world, videos and images that look even slightly out of the way add to a visitor's negative impression of a site. Besides those forced into the wrong configurations can even interfere with a site's usability.

Poorly proportioned user guide or product images video that's too stretched to check clearly can affect both a visitor's want and their ability to use the site. Developers, designers, and anyone working with images will need to know how aspect ratios work and manipulate them for the best visual effect.

Various **pixel calculator ratios**, both paid and free, have popped up on the web to streamline the process.

## Part 4 Difference among Pixel Aspect Ratio, Display Aspect Ratio, and Storage Aspect Ratio

Although the image aspect ratio comes from its width and height, it also contains multiple subsets that help to define image proportions properly.

1 - **Pixel aspect ratio**

Pixel aspect ratio (PAR) is the proportion of the specific pixels within an image. They are generally square within the pixel aspect ratio of 1:1.

But sometimes, specific images are optimized for certain types of displays. And, they have rectangular pixels with an aspect ratio of 4:3 or similar.

2 - **Display aspect ratio**

The display aspect ratio (DAR) is the designers' most frequent aspect ratio and gets generally synced with the general term.

As the name suggests, the display aspect ratio refers to the proportions of an image as it appears on different screens out there.

Some devices, such as televisions and cameras, have a fixed DAR for images to display nicely on these devices.

They need optimization for their specific or respective aspect ratio. For instance, a typical display aspect ratio for the widescreen video on a television screen or monitor screen is 16:9.

They appear distorted when images with different aspect ratios are presented on these devices. Digital SLR camera sensors also consist of a fixed display aspect ratio, which controls how pictures captured by the camera will be displayed and saved.

3 - **Storage aspect ratio**

Storage aspect ratio, commonly known as (SAR) is an aspect ratio formula that concerns specifically to encoded digital video files. SAR refers to the height and the width relationship in video frame size, and it is required to be consistent among all individual frames.

SAR x PAR = DAR for max widescreen videos in a usual used formula.

## Part 1 Part 5: How Aspect Ratios Affect UI/UX Design?

Aspect ratios play a vital part in any project that consists of displaying and capturing photographs, videos, or other image-based files in an ideal manner. The camera's fixed aspect ratio can considerably impact, especially for photographers.

And for videographers or anyone working with slideshows, animations, and other motion projects, the aspect ratio is a prominent element for correct display on mobile devices and widescreen.

But even in the environment of responsive web design, problems can arise, such as when an image is not adjustable for display without compromising its quality or content.

A small example is when you need a square image with a 1:1 aspect ratio to insert into a rectangular box on a web page. To accommodate varying image size requirements, proportions and size may need adjustment.

In an increasingly picture-driven digital world, videos and images that look even slightly out of the way add to a visitor's negative impression of a site. Besides those forced into the wrong configurations can even interfere with a site's usability.

Poorly proportioned user guide or product images video that's too stretched to check clearly can affect both a visitor's want and their ability to use the site. Developers, designers, and anyone working with images will need to know how aspect ratios work and manipulate them for the best visual effect.

Various **pixel calculator ratios**, both paid and free, have popped up on the web to streamline the process.

Size, formats, and resolution… What are pixels exactly doing with it?

![pixel](https://images.wondershare.com/filmora/article-images/2021/how-to-calculate-pixel-calculator-ratio1.jpg)

So let's review some basics on pixel calculator ratio to create an easy life, your workflow more productive, and your photos of the ideal size for the intended purpose.

02 [How is Pixel Ratio Calculated?](#Part 2)

03 [Par (pixel Aspect Ratio) in Adobe Premiere Pro/Filmora?](#Part 3)

04 [Difference among Pixel Aspect Ratio, Display Aspect Ratio, and Storage Aspect Ratio](#Part 4)

05 [How Aspect Ratios Affect UI/UX Design?](#Part 5)

## Part 1 What is Pixel Aspect Ratio?

A digital image is not a single non-dividable thing. You’ll see that your photo is like a mosaic formed by small tiles if you zoom in far enough, which are known as pixels in photography.

The amount of these pixels and the way they are divided are the two elements that you’re required to take into account to know more about the resolution and **pixel** **calculator ratio**.

The Pixel Aspect Ratio is simply the latest way of defining the length of one side of a pixel in context to the length of the other.

Let's say the ratio is 1:1; each side of the pixel is the same length as the other, also known as a square in pixels.

If the ratio is 2:1, it means that one side is twice the length of the other.

**NOTE**: The 'Aspect Ratio' does not define the actual or exact length of the side of a pixel is, just its "relative" size of one side to the other. The actual length will depend on how much you shrink or stretch a photo when recreating it. But if the **Pixel Calculator Ratio** is 1:1, then the pixels will always be square irrespective of the size of that particular photo.

![pixel aspect ratio](https://images.wondershare.com/filmora/article-images/2021/how-to-calculate-pixel-calculator-ratio2.jpg)

## Part 2 How is Pixel Ratio Calculated?

You can use a **pixel ratio calculator** to calculate the pixels within a screen. So, we'd like to suggest a calculator by xwebtools.com.

Here, you can see tabs, namely the **Common Ratios** **Ratio Width**, **Ratio Height**, **Pixels Width**, and **Pixels Height**.

![xwebtools pixel ratio calculator](https://images.wondershare.com/filmora/article-images/2021/how-to-calculate-pixel-calculator-ratio3.jpg)

**How it works:**

This **pixel ratio calculator** converts pixel dimensions to aspect ratios. It is an online free tool that assists you in calculating the aspect ratio value of an object or a photo.

The conversion can be carried in both ways, aspect ratio to pixels and pixels to aspect ratio. This screen resolution calculator offers a powerful and simple tool that can convert the ratio of images to pixels resolution and pixels to ratio dimensions.

You need to provide Pixels Width and Pixels Height to calculate the aspect ratio; the aspect ratio will be automatically calculated.

You need to provide Ratio Height and Ratio Width to calculate pixel resolutions. Both the Pixels Width and Height will get automatically calculated.

## Part 3 What is Par (pixel Aspect Ratio) in Adobe Premiere Pro/Filmora?

**Pixel ratio: Adobe Premiere Pro**

As we already discussed, an aspect ratio defines width to height. The still picture and video frames have a frame aspect ratio. The pixels that create the frame have a pixel aspect ratio (sometimes called PAR).

Different video recording standards have different aspect ratios. For instance, you record video for television in either a 16:9 or a 4:3 frame aspect ratio.

You set the frame and pixel aspect when you create a project in Adobe Premiere Pro. Once you set these ratios, you can't change them for that project. However, you can edit the aspect ratio of a sequence. You can also use assets made with different aspect ratios in the project.

Premiere Pro automatically compensates for the pixel aspect ratio of source files.

If an asset still feels distorted, you can manually mention its pixel aspect ratio. But that isn't very clear, especially for a beginner. This is why we recommend doing the following.

**Pixel ratio: Wondershare Filmora**

You need a converter or a video editor to change the aspect ratio permanently. Here we humbly recommend an excellent aspect ratio changer - [Wondershare Filmora](https://tools.techidaily.com/wondershare/filmora/download/) video editor, which helps you make 4:3, 9:16, 16:9, and 1:1 aspect ratio videos pretty quickly.
