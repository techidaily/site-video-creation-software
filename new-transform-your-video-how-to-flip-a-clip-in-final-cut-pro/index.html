<p>Cartooning a photo is a simple and yet effective way of enhancing a picture and making it more visually appealing. Besides adding an artistic touch to portraits you take, cartooning a photo can also be a great way to have fun with your friends because the results of picture cartooning can be as entertaining as visually striking.</p>
<p>Besides portraiture, this visual effect can be applied to virtually any other genre of photography, although the contents of the shoot usually determine how well the effect is going to work. What’s more, you don’t need a <a class="link"   target="_blank" rel="noopener" href="https://tools.techidaily.com/wondershare/filmora/download/" >professional video editing software <i class="fa-regular fa-arrow-up-right-from-square fa-sm"></i></a> to cartoon a photo, since there are so many websites that let you apply this effect to your photos for free.</p>
<p>That’s why we selected some of the best websites for converting a photo into a cartoon.</p>

In fact, online cartoon photo makers are easy to use and they don’t require you to have a lot of photo editing experience.</p>
<p>We’ve selected some of the <a class="link"   target="_blank" rel="noopener" href="https://tools.techidaily.com/wondershare/filmora/download/" >best online photo editors <i class="fa-regular fa-arrow-up-right-from-square fa-sm"></i></a> and photo converters that enable you to cartoon your photos in just a few clicks.</p>
<h3 id="Part-1-Best-Free-Online-Cartoon-Photo-Editors"><a href="#Part-1-Best-Free-Online-Cartoon-Photo-Editors" class="headerlink" title="Part 1: Best Free Online Cartoon Photo Editors"></a>Part 1: Best Free Online Cartoon Photo Editors</h3><p>You don’t have to purchase an expensive photo editing software if you want to cartoon your photos because there are so many different online photo editing platforms that allow you to apply this effect to your photos for free. Let’s take a closer look at what they have to offer.</p>
<h4 id="2-BeFunky"><a href="#2-BeFunky" class="headerlink" title="2. BeFunky"></a>2. BeFunky</h4><p>Befunky is one of the best photo editors you can find online, which is why it is hardly surprising that it offers cartoonization effects. In fact, you can choose from <strong>five different cartoonization effects</strong> that are all equally impressive.</p>
<p>All of the cartoon effects Befunky has to offer are located in the Artsy menu, and you just have to click on Cartoonizer DLX, Cross Hatch DLX, Pop Art DLX, or Graphic Novel DLX effects in order to apply them to your photo. Furthermore, you can use the Erase mode if you don’t want to catoonize the entire photo or head over to the Adjust menu to specify the amount of the effect you’ll apply and increase or decrease the photo’s sharpness.</p>
<p>Go to <a class="link"   target="_blank" rel="noopener" href="https://www.befunky.com/features/photo-to-cartoon/" >https://www.befunky.com/features/photo-to-cartoon/ <i class="fa-regular fa-arrow-up-right-from-square fa-sm"></i></a> and you can then turn your photos to cartoon easily in BeFunky.</p>
<h4 id="3-Lunapic"><a href="#3-Lunapic" class="headerlink" title="3. Lunapic"></a>3. Lunapic</h4><p>This is yet another online photo editing platform that gives you access to a broad range of photo editing options for free. Even though a bit outdated, the Lunapic’s interface resembles Photoshop’s interface, so you won’t need much time to get used to it if you ever used Adobe’s iconic photo editing software.</p>
<p>Once you’ve uploaded a photo, you just have to go to the Effects menu and select the Cartoon option. Lunapic will then automatically apply the effect to the photo you uploaded and you just need to preview the image before you save it. The only downside is that you can’t adjust the effect’s settings in case you don’t like the results.</p>
<p>If you want to add cartoon effect to photo with this photo editor, you can go to <a class="link"   target="_blank" rel="noopener" href="https://www12.lunapic.com/editor/?action=cartoon" >https://www12.lunapic.com/editor/?action=cartoon <i class="fa-regular fa-arrow-up-right-from-square fa-sm"></i></a>.</p>

If you like the caricature you created, you can buy a print or you can choose to share your design for free. The Pro Cartoonizer feature this platform offers is only available if you purchase one of the available subscription plans.</p>
<p>Here is the website <a class="link"   target="_blank" rel="noopener" href="https://www.wish2be.com/app/cartoon-photo-editor/" >https://www.wish2be.com/app/cartoon-photo-editor/ <i class="fa-regular fa-arrow-up-right-from-square fa-sm"></i></a> for cartoon photos with Wish2Be.</p>
<h4 id="5-SnapsTouch"><a href="#5-SnapsTouch" class="headerlink" title="5. SnapsTouch"></a>5. SnapsTouch</h4><p>This is a simple online photo editor that lets you turn your photos into sketches, paintings, or drawings. Choosing the Painting option is probably the easiest way to turn a photo into a cartoon, although this effect can also be achieved with the Pencil Sketch feature.</p>
<p>After you upload a photo you want to turn into a cartoon, you can choose between Painting 1 and Painting 2 options in order to determine the style of the cartoon you’re creating.

<h4 id="2-BeFunky-2"><a href="#2-BeFunky-2" class="headerlink" title="2. BeFunky"></a>2. BeFunky</h4><p>Befunky is one of the best photo editors you can find online, which is why it is hardly surprising that it offers cartoonization effects.

<p>All of the cartoon effects Befunky has to offer are located in the Artsy menu, and you just have to click on Cartoonizer DLX, Cross Hatch DLX, Pop Art DLX, or Graphic Novel DLX effects in order to apply them to your photo. Furthermore, you can use the Erase mode if you don’t want to catoonize the entire photo or head over to the Adjust menu to specify the amount of the effect you’ll apply and increase or decrease the photo’s sharpness.</p>

<p>Once you’ve uploaded a photo, you just have to go to the Effects menu and select the Cartoon option. Lunapic will then automatically apply the effect to the photo you uploaded and you just need to preview the image before you save it.

You just have to upload a photo in order to start converting it. After the picture is uploaded you can adjust Color Improvement, Color Detail, Contour Style, and Contour Strength options.</p>
<p>In addition, you can choose whether or not you want to make a soft drawing. In case you do, you can adjust the Softness Level and Softness Extent values and then click on the Generate button.

Once you upload a picture from Facebook, your hard drive, or via an URL the platform will generate a preview where you can see how your cartoonized photo looks. Besides the Cartoon effect, this mode also offers the Face Morphing and Face Auto Crop options.</p>
<p>You should click on the Save and Share button if you like the result. However, fine-tuning the effect’s settings isn’t possible, so there isn’t much you can do if you didn’t like the results of cartoonization. Optionally you can open the photo you turned into a cartoon in the platform’s editor and add text layers, stickers or tweak the brightness and contrast values.</p>
<p>Visit <a class="link"   target="_blank" rel="noopener" href="https://cartoon.pho.to/" >https://cartoon.pho.to/ <i class="fa-regular fa-arrow-up-right-from-square fa-sm"></i></a> to use the cartoon.pho.to tool.</p>

You can then start browsing through the huge collection of cartoon effects.</p>
<p>Once you find the effect you like you should click on it in order to apply it to your photo and then preview the results. Adjusting the effect’s settings is not possible, and some cartoon effects are only available on the desktop version of the app. Moreover, all photos you cartoonize on this platform are watermarked and you must install Prima Cartoonizer on your computer if you want to create watermark-free cartoons from your photos.</p>

<p>Online cartoon photo editors and converters are remarkably easy to use, and they enable you to turn any photo you take into an entertaining cartoon in just a few clicks. However, some of these online platforms watermark your pictures and don’t allow you to adjust the effect’s settings, which impact the quality of the final cartoonized photo.</p>
