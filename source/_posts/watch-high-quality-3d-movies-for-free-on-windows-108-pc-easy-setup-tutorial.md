### 3D Technology Display Brief Intro Before Playing 3D Movies on PC

To address how to play 3D movies on computer, gaining a little knowledge of 3D tech is necessary. Nowadays, there are mainly 5 commonly used formats for 3D film displaying: Anaglyph, Polarization systems, Eclipse method, Interference filter technology, and Autostereoscopy, and the former two are the most used technologies to watch 3D movies and are the closest to us 3D viewers. 

To play 3D films on Windows PC is different from what cinemas and TVs are doing. Cinemas and modern 3D TVs provide polarized 3D films to watch. But for PC, Laptop, Tablet etc. with normal displays (LCD), Anaglyph 3D, the earliest and easiest method of presenting 3D movies in theater, is applied.
