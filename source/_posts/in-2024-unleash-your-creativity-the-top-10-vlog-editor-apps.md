There is no doubt that Smartphone cameras can capture videos in breathtaking quality, but using a phone as a camera still has its challenges. The footage recorded with a Smartphone can often be shaky, especially if you’re shooting handheld or it can just contain parts that you don’t want to share with your followers on social media. In 2024, you can edit all videos immediately after you capture them, but in order to do that, you first need to discover a **vlog editor app**  that you really like using. That’s why we are going to take you through some of the best apps you can use to quickly edit your vlogs before you publish them on your iPhone or Android phones.

There are thousands of video editing software for Windows and Mac, Filmora [video editor](https://tools.techidaily.com/wondershare/filmora/download/) should be on the list since it provides all the basic editing tools that you need to edit a vlog video as well as plentiful pre-programmed video effects and templates and royalty-free music tracks and sound effects. Download the free trial version and have a try.

There are many video editing apps that you can use on both a mobile device or a desktop computer. If you’re editing vlog videos on iPhone, you can use the free built-in iMovie. If you are using Android to vlog, you can try Filmora. For vloggers who prefer to edit videos on a Windows or Mac computer, I recommend Filmora because of the resources and effects.

1. **Can I vlog with my phone?**

Yes, of course, you can vlog with your iPhone or Android phone. In recent days, most phones are equipped with a high-quality camera, and with the help of some camera shoot apps and video editing apps, you can totally record, edit and upload vlog videos on your phone.

1. **Which video editing software do vloggers use?**

There is no best for all. For vloggers in different stages, I recommend different editing software. For beginners who did not have any editing experience, I recommend you to try the pre-programmed video editing apps, such as Windows 10 Photos or iMovie.

Yes, of course, you can vlog with your iPhone or Android phone. In recent days, most phones are equipped with a high-quality camera, and with the help of some camera shoot apps and video editing apps, you can totally record, edit and upload vlog videos on your phone.

## Part 3 **Best 5 Facebook Mp3 Downloader Online**

Finally, we've gotten to the part where we introduce all the best **Facebook Audio Converter** websites available! These are all online tools that you can visit and use (in much the same way described in the two tutorials above) in order to turn your Facebook video into an MP3!

### 01**Facebook Video Downloader**

Facebook Video Downloader is the first of the **Facebook MP3 Converters** on this list. The URL for it has been provided below! And, as you can see from the image provided, you can use it by pasting the direct URL of the Facebook video that you want to convert and then pressing the 'Download' button! The best part of it is that it has several conversation formats (both for audio and video conversion), including, of course, **Facebook to MP3 Converter (free!)**

The O-Downloader (Facebook Downloader) is simpler than the previous two that we introduced. For one, it can only convert videos from Facebook, YouTube, and Instagram.

Getfvid makes it to the top of our list for its sheer popularity! This is the **Facebook MP3 converter** that many people defaulted to. It is, after all, an completely FREE video converter. And, just like the other Facebook video downloaders, we introduced in the previous section, it's pretty easy to use as well!

### 02**Online Video Converter**

Online Video Converter is another online conversion tool that you might want to consider. Compared to some of the other online converters out there, it is packed with lots of features (allowing you to download Facebook audio but also audio from many other social media platforms and websites. Plus, converting in a variety of formats!)

### 03**AceThinker**

AceThinker makes our third online **Facebook MP3 converter** on this list. It works just like the rest and offers a couple of extra features on top of that (which includes multiple formats for conversions and, also, the ability to download and convert videos to audio from other sites.)

### 04**Wondershare Filmora**

**[Wondershare Filmora Video Editor](https://tools.techidaily.com/wondershare/filmora/download/)** is the first and only **Facebook MP3 Converter** software on this list! It will require download and installation. And, it's a freemium tool as well. So, you'll have to keep that in mind. However, unlike every other **Facebook audio converter** on this list, it comes with advanced video editing features that will allow you to actually put the audio that you downloaded to use (be it for a special video message, a professional presentation, a fun party video, and so on.)

For macOS 10.12 or later

### 05**Flash Video Downloader (Plug-In)**

The next **Facebook audio converter** is also different from the norm! After all, it's a plug-in! More specifically, it's a chrome extension that you can download (for free) from the Chrome web store and install into your browser! It's obviously a lot different from the other converters that we've introduced thus far, but it works just as well! If you want to learn more, check out the YouTube video, where the process is explained in more detail.

### 06**Video Downloader Professional (Plug-In)**

Next, we have another chrome extension in the form of 'Video Downloader Professional'! This plug-in, just like the previous one, is available for Chrome browsers and you can use it to download media (including Facebook audio) whenever you want.

### 07**Stream Recorder (Plug-In)**

Stream Recorder is our third and final chrome extension in this list! This one is a bit different though! Mainly because, rather than instantly downloading media, you have to turn it on and let the media play (in order to record it!) It's mainly used for recording live streams (but it works on Facebook, so you can use it as a **Facebook audio converter** if that is what you need.)

### 08**Apowersoft**

With Apowersoft, we go back to the most common type of online converter! It's the perfect place to round us off. After all, it is very similar to the other converters we introduced in the beginning!

## Key Takeaways from This Episode

**●** Need a way of converting a Facebook video into an audio file? Well, then you don't have to worry anymore! Hopefully, the tutorials we've provided will be able to help you on your quest!

**●** There are plenty of online Facebook MP3 converters that you can use for this!

To start, let's talk about how you can convert a Facebook video into an MP3! For this, we'll be using one of the Facebook Converters that we'll be introducing in the lists near the end of the article. As well illustrate just how the general process goes (it's the same for most online Facebook video converters!)

**Step 1: Log in to Facebook!**

First of all, you'll of course need to be logged in for your Facebook account!

![Facebook Log-in Page](https://images.wondershare.com/filmora/article-images/2021/best-8-facebook-mp3-converter-online%201.png)

Next, plug the direct URL of the video that you want to download on your chosen **Facebook MP3 Converter** and click the download/convert button!

![Use Facebook Downloader](https://images.wondershare.com/filmora/article-images/2021/best-8-facebook-mp3-converter-online%204.png)

## Part 2 **How to Download and Convert a Facebook Video Online**

**Step 1: Go to Facebook Video!**

Like before, we start with getting the direct URL of your chosen Facebook video! For this, remember to first select the "..." menu!

![Facebook Post Options](https://images.wondershare.com/filmora/article-images/2021/best-8-facebook-mp3-converter-online%205.png)

**Step 2: Copy Facebook Video URL!**

Next, select the "Copy Link" option of the Facebook video that you want to download and convert!

**Step 3: Use Facebook Video Converter!**

**Step 4: Use MP4 to MP3 Converter!**

Once you've had your Facebook video converted into an MP4, all you need to do is upload that MP4 files to a free converter (like the one shown in the image below, URL provided!) In this way, you achieve Facebook to MP3 conversion!

![Use Online Video Converter](https://images.wondershare.com/filmora/article-images/2021/best-8-facebook-mp3-converter-online%208.png)

## Part 3 **Best 5 Facebook Mp3 Downloader Online**

Finally, we've gotten to the part where we introduce all the best **Facebook Audio Converter** websites available! These are all online tools that you can visit and use (in much the same way described in the two tutorials above) in order to turn your Facebook video into an MP3!

### 01**Facebook Video Downloader**

Facebook Video Downloader is the first of the **Facebook MP3 Converters** on this list. The URL for it has been provided below! And, as you can see from the image provided, you can use it by pasting the direct URL of the Facebook video that you want to convert and then pressing the 'Download' button! The best part of it is that it has several conversation formats (both for audio and video conversion), including, of course, **Facebook to MP3 Converter (free!)**

![Facebook Video Downloader - Facebook Downloader](https://images.wondershare.com/filmora/article-images/2021/best-8-facebook-mp3-converter-online%209.png)

### 02**MP3Conv**

MP3Conv is another online **Facebook MP3 Converter** that you can use 100% for free. Furthermore, it also works for other sites (including, YouTube, Instagram, Twitter, and Reddit!) The process for using this tool is pretty much the same way as all the rest as well. Just past and click 'Download' to finish!

![MP3CONV Facebook Downloader](https://images.wondershare.com/filmora/article-images/2021/best-8-facebook-mp3-converter-online%2010.png)

### 03**O Downloader**

The O-Downloader (Facebook Downloader) is simpler than the previous two that we introduced. For one, it can only convert videos from Facebook, YouTube, and Instagram. Its conversion options are also limited to MP3 and MP4! However, aside from those differences, you use it pretty much how you would use any online video converter — paste the link and click 'Download'!

![O-Downloader Facebook Downloader](https://images.wondershare.com/filmora/article-images/2021/best-8-facebook-mp3-converter-online%2011.png)

### 04**X2Convert**

X2 Convert, accordingly, works the same way. It's a **Facebook Audio Converter** that you can use pretty much at any time (for free, no installation or download required.) Just visit the URL provided, paste the link of the video that you want to download, and go!

![X2Convert Facebook Downloader](https://images.wondershare.com/filmora/article-images/2021/best-8-facebook-mp3-converter-online%2012.png)

### 05**Youtube 4K Downloader**

The YouTube 4K Downloader tool, despite its name, works as well as your average **Facebook MP3 converter**! As you can see in the image below, they have an option specifically for converting Facebook videos into MP3s!

![Facebook Downloader](https://images.wondershare.com/filmora/article-images/2021/best-8-facebook-mp3-converter-online%2013.png)

## Part 4 **Top 8 Facebook Mp3 Converter Online**

For this next section, we've gathered up a couple of other **Facebook MP3 Converter**s that you can use! This time, however, we've also attached a Youtube video from which you can learn how to use said converter! And, even more importantly, we've varied things up a bit — including not just online converters, but also plug-ins and software.

### 01**Facebook Video Downloader**

Facebook Video Downloader is the first of the **Facebook MP3 Converters** on this list. The URL for it has been provided below! And, as you can see from the image provided, you can use it by pasting the direct URL of the Facebook video that you want to convert and then pressing the 'Download' button! The best part of it is that it has several conversation formats (both for audio and video conversion), including, of course, **Facebook to MP3 Converter (free!)**

![Facebook Video Downloader - Facebook Downloader](https://images.wondershare.com/filmora/article-images/2021/best-8-facebook-mp3-converter-online%209.png)

### 02**MP3Conv**

MP3Conv is another online **Facebook MP3 Converter** that you can use 100% for free. Furthermore, it also works for other sites (including, YouTube, Instagram, Twitter, and Reddit!) The process for using this tool is pretty much the same way as all the rest as well. Just past and click 'Download' to finish!

![MP3CONV Facebook Downloader](https://images.wondershare.com/filmora/article-images/2021/best-8-facebook-mp3-converter-online%2010.png)

### 03**O Downloader**

The O-Downloader (Facebook Downloader) is simpler than the previous two that we introduced. For one, it can only convert videos from Facebook, YouTube, and Instagram. Its conversion options are also limited to MP3 and MP4! However, aside from those differences, you use it pretty much how you would use any online video converter — paste the link and click 'Download'!

![O-Downloader Facebook Downloader](https://images.wondershare.com/filmora/article-images/2021/best-8-facebook-mp3-converter-online%2011.png)

### 04**X2Convert**

X2 Convert, accordingly, works the same way. It's a **Facebook Audio Converter** that you can use pretty much at any time (for free, no installation or download required.) Just visit the URL provided, paste the link of the video that you want to download, and go!

![X2Convert Facebook Downloader](https://images.wondershare.com/filmora/article-images/2021/best-8-facebook-mp3-converter-online%2012.png)

### 05**Youtube 4K Downloader**

The YouTube 4K Downloader tool, despite its name, works as well as your average **Facebook MP3 converter**! As you can see in the image below, they have an option specifically for converting Facebook videos into MP3s!

![Facebook Downloader](https://images.wondershare.com/filmora/article-images/2021/best-8-facebook-mp3-converter-online%2013.png)

## Part 4 **Top 8 Facebook Mp3 Converter Online**

For this next section, we've gathered up a couple of other **Facebook MP3 Converter**s that you can use! This time, however, we've also attached a Youtube video from which you can learn how to use said converter! And, even more importantly, we've varied things up a bit — including not just online converters, but also plug-ins and software.

### 01**Getfvid**

Getfvid makes it to the top of our list for its sheer popularity! This is the **Facebook MP3 converter** that many people defaulted to. It is, after all, an completely FREE video converter. And, just like the other Facebook video downloaders, we introduced in the previous section, it's pretty easy to use as well!

### 02**Online Video Converter**

Online Video Converter is another online conversion tool that you might want to consider. Compared to some of the other online converters out there, it is packed with lots of features (allowing you to download Facebook audio but also audio from many other social media platforms and websites. Plus, converting in a variety of formats!)

### 03**AceThinker**

AceThinker makes our third online **Facebook MP3 converter** on this list. It works just like the rest and offers a couple of extra features on top of that (which includes multiple formats for conversions and, also, the ability to download and convert videos to audio from other sites.)

### 04**Wondershare Filmora**

**[Wondershare Filmora Video Editor](https://tools.techidaily.com/wondershare/filmora/download/)** is the first and only **Facebook MP3 Converter** software on this list! It will require download and installation. And, it's a freemium tool as well. So, you'll have to keep that in mind. However, unlike every other **Facebook audio converter** on this list, it comes with advanced video editing features that will allow you to actually put the audio that you downloaded to use (be it for a special video message, a professional presentation, a fun party video, and so on.)

[Try It Free](https://tools.techidaily.com/wondershare/filmora/download/)

For macOS 10.12 or later

### 05**Flash Video Downloader (Plug-In)**

The next **Facebook audio converter** is also different from the norm! After all, it's a plug-in! More specifically, it's a chrome extension that you can download (for free) from the Chrome web store and install into your browser! It's obviously a lot different from the other converters that we've introduced thus far, but it works just as well! If you want to learn more, check out the YouTube video, where the process is explained in more detail.

### 06**Video Downloader Professional (Plug-In)**

Next, we have another chrome extension in the form of 'Video Downloader Professional'! This plug-in, just like the previous one, is available for Chrome browsers and you can use it to download media (including Facebook audio) whenever you want.

### 07**Stream Recorder (Plug-In)**

Stream Recorder is our third and final chrome extension in this list! This one is a bit different though! Mainly because, rather than instantly downloading media, you have to turn it on and let the media play (in order to record it!) It's mainly used for recording live streams (but it works on Facebook, so you can use it as a **Facebook audio converter** if that is what you need.)

### 08**Apowersoft**

With Apowersoft, we go back to the most common type of online converter! It's the perfect place to round us off. After all, it is very similar to the other converters we introduced in the beginning!

## Key Takeaways from This Episode

**●** Need a way of converting a Facebook video into an audio file? Well, then you don't have to worry anymore! Hopefully, the tutorials we've provided will be able to help you on your quest!

**●** There are plenty of online Facebook MP3 converters that you can use for this!

## Key Takeaways from This Episode

**●** Found a video on Instagram with audio that you really like? Well, then it's easy enough to get your hand on it (so long as you don't intend to make use of it nefariously, of course!)

**●** There are Instagram-to-MP3 converters that will allow you to literally convert your favorite Instagram videos into an MP3 in a single click (without having to ever even download or install anything!)

**●** Although, of course, if you're looking for something more advanced than you're average, online video converter tool, there are other more premium options that you can try out to step up your game.
