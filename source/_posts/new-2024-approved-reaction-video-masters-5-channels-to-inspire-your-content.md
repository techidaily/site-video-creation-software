And then you can blend the reaction video with the original one fluently.

You can then simply import them into iMovie, and place footage of yourself reacting to a video to the timeline. Afterward, you should place the actual video to which you are reacting above or below the video file that contains the footage of your reaction, depending on which video clip you want to use as a background video.

However, the overlaid video is not going to be automatically visible in the preview screen, so you should just click on the Video Overlay Settings and pick the Picture in Picture option.

Once the OBS’ main window loads, you just have to specify the sources from which you want to record the footage. Simply right-click anywhere within the Sources tab, select the Add option and choose the Display Capture setting from the submenu.

The video containing your reaction should be below the video you are commenting on so that the second video can be treated as an overlay. Click on the Event Pan/Crop button and readjust the size and the on-screen location of the video you’re reacting to. When done, you can proceed to sync both videos so that your reactions correspond with the events in the other video. Don’t forget to preview the reaction video you’ve created before exporting it.

The Pro subscription plan that can be purchased for $54 per month will grant you access to an almost endless selection of title templates as well as a huge selection of plugins for Adobe Premiere Pro.

![free premiere pro templates](https://images.wondershare.com/filmora/article-images/Motion-Array.jpg)

Once you've installed all the fonts from the library, you can use them to replace the software's default library. You just have to click on the Replace Style Library option that can be accessed from Premiere Pro's Title Style tab.

If you don't feel comfortable creating your titles or if you simply don't have the time to create your own titles, the Free Cinematic Style Library is not the best choice for you.

### 16. [Motion Array](https://motionarray.com/browse)

In addition to an impressive library of intro templates, Motion Array offers presets, sound effects, royalty-free music, and stock footage.

The website provides you with powerful search tools, so you can select the resolution of the template, up to 8K, or choose which types of templates are going to be displayed.

Using the free subscription plan can limit your options since you'll only be able to download free templates, and your upload storage will be limited to just 1GB.

The Pro subscription plan that can be purchased for $54 per month will grant you access to an almost endless selection of title templates as well as a huge selection of plugins for Adobe Premiere Pro.

![free premiere pro templates](https://images.wondershare.com/filmora/article-images/Motion-Array.jpg)

Once you've installed all the fonts from the library, you can use them to replace the software's default library. You just have to click on the Replace Style Library option that can be accessed from Premiere Pro's Title Style tab.

If you don't feel comfortable creating your titles or if you simply don't have the time to create your own titles, the Free Cinematic Style Library is not the best choice for you.

## Part 1 Best 5 Practices to Increase Engagement for Twitter Videos

As Twitter videos are gaining a larger audience and it has become a great source to promote your brand, it is essential to focus a bit more on making them more engaging. Here are some of the best practices that you can opt for increasing the engagement for your Twitter videos:

**Use of hash tags -** On the social media platforms, it is common to use the hash tags to make a better reach for your videos. You may see people sometimes use a lot of hash tags but in the case of Twitter, less hash tags can do the most effective work. The only thing to keep in mind is that they should be completely relevant to the topic and content.

**Simple and short -** In today’s world, as all the people are so busy in their works and daily schedules they can easily get distracted by the things. If this is the case so it is not a good idea to make longer videos. This means that if your videos will be short and simple then they can easily get more audience and will also get shared widely. You should keep the first few moments of your video so engaging and interesting so that the viewer can stick back till the end. This is very important to leave a positive impact of your brand on your audience and targeted users.

**Captions -** Adding captions is another amazing way to increase the reach and boost engagement on your videos. You must be aware of the fact that nowadays the users prefer to use these apps through mobile phones and there they can even turn the sound off. So you will need to have a strategy so that you can keep the viewer engaged. This is the reason why captions are necessary. Also the captions that you are adding on your video must be of high quality and must catch the attention of your audience.

**Add the logo:** Twitter also suggests its users to add their logo in the frame of their videos. By logo, people can easily recognize your brand and they will also know about you via that logo. They will also be able to contact you further. The only worth considering thing is that the logo which you are adding must be engaging and eye-catching.

**Use the correct tools -** Using the correct tools cannot be neglected. If the tools that you are using will not be appropriate then they can lessen the quality of your videos. Many tools are available to the editing and video creation. **[Wondershare Filmora Video Editor](https://tools.techidaily.com/wondershare/filmora/download/)** is one of the most high quality tools for your work.
