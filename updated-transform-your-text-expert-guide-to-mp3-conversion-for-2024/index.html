<p>Text-to-Speech is an ingenious accessibility invention that has only grown more and more popular as AI has been thrown in the mix — making the converted speech sound more natural than ever!</p>
<p>As requested, in this article, we’ll be focusing on the subject of <strong>converting text to MP3</strong> format (or, rather, a tangible file that you can use for projects!)</p>

<h2 id="Part-1-What-is-TTS"><a href="#Part-1-What-is-TTS" class="headerlink" title="Part 1 What is TTS?"></a>Part 1 <strong>What is TTS?</strong></h2><p>What is Text-to-Speech? Text-to-Speech, also called TTS, as previously mentioned, is an accessibility invention. It was developed to help those with vision impairment or blindness — giving them the ability to have text read to them out loud to them (without requiring someone specifically read it out loud for them.</p>
<p>More recent development in TTS technology has allowed it to grow more useful outside of those parameters, however. Especially seeing as it is now possible to convert <strong>text to MP3 with natural voices</strong>.</p>
<h3 id="01Why-Use-Text-to-Speech-Converter"><a href="#01Why-Use-Text-to-Speech-Converter" class="headerlink" title="01Why Use Text to Speech Converter?"></a>01Why Use Text to Speech Converter?</h3><p><strong>Text-to-Speech human voice converter</strong>s are popular with content creators, and thus, they are the ones who see the most use for them (in the commercial sense). After all, it’s easy enough to convert already created content (in the form of text) into an audio file that there’s no reason not to! Especially since it means that more people would have access to their content!</p>

Getting a live voice actor to <strong>convert text to MP3</strong> for you is very expensive — since you’re paying not only for the voice-actors hours spent but also the use of the expensive equipment that they use for creating voiceovers.</p>
<p>In that regard, even PAID text-to-speech converters are easier on the budget. Making it the perfect solution for content creators who want to increase the accessibility of their content but do not have the time (to create the voiceovers themselves) or the money (to hire someone else to record it).</p>

And, depending on what you’re looking for, you might find yourself longing for extra features later on down the line. That is why, when looking to <strong>convert text to MP3</strong> we recommend considering the following:</p>
<p><strong>●</strong> <strong>Converting Time</strong>: How fast does the converter work? Most text-to-speech converters work almost instantaneously! So, if the one you’re using currently is slow? It might be best to give it a pass over to the next candidate.</p>
<p><strong>●</strong> <strong>Sound Quality</strong>: You should also test out whether or not the sound quality of the converted text to speech is good.</p>
<p><strong>●</strong> <strong>Multi-Language Support</strong>: Since this is all for the sake of increasing accessibility, you should start thinking about how many languages your converter supports as well. You might not be able to use all of them or even want to. But, that extra function can be helpful for the future.</p>
<p><strong>●</strong> <strong>Voice-Control Options</strong>: Does the converter offers you advanced voice controls? Your average converter usually offers speed and voice options, but you might find that a text-to-speech converter with more advanced options (i.e., tone, pitch, etc. controls) may help you get better quality content in the long run.</p>

Specifically, a FREEmium text-to-speech converter that you can use when you’re still on the trying-out stage! This part will include a tutorial and a short introduction:</p>
<h3 id="014-Steps-to-Use-and-Convert-Text-to-Speech-Online-Free-Unlimited"><a href="#014-Steps-to-Use-and-Convert-Text-to-Speech-Online-Free-Unlimited" class="headerlink" title="014 Steps to Use and Convert Text to Speech Online Free Unlimited?"></a>014 Steps to Use and Convert Text to Speech Online Free Unlimited?</h3><p>First, for the promised tutorial! Most <strong>text-to-human voice converter</strong>s function much the same way. The main difference usually being on the number of features focused and the limitations imposed (for tools with FREEmium services that impose limits on the FREE version, like the tool we’ll be using for our example):</p>
<p><strong>Step 1: Upload Text</strong></p>
<p>First, upload the text that you want to convert into speech!</p>
<p>Most online converters offer a text box that you can use in order to copy &amp; paste the text onto (like in the image below), while others offer an ‘upload’ feature that you can use to upload text from a document.</p>

                      alt="Upload or Copy &amp; Paste Text"
                ></p>
<p><strong>Step 2: Adjust Voice Reader!</strong></p>
<p>Next, the main thing that you usually have to worry about is the voice options.</p>
<p>Most TTS converters at least offer the opportunity to choose what voice you want the text to be read in. Some, more advanced solutions, may offer voices in other languages, dialects, accents, etc. as well as voice control options (tone, pitch, etc.)</p>
<p><img  
                     lazyload
                     src="/images/loading.svg"

                      alt="Set Voice Reader"
                ></p>
<p><strong>Step 3: Reader Controls!</strong></p>
<p>Outside of voice options, most text-to-speech converters also offer the ability to control the general outcome of the converted text to speech.</p>
<p>More advanced tools will have multiple options on offer for this, but even the most basic ones at least offer a method for controlling the speed at which the text is read by the voice you’ve chosen!</p>

                     lazyload

                      alt="Adjust Speech Controls"
                ></p>
<p><strong>Step 4: Convert Text to MP3!</strong></p>
<p>Now is finally the time to <strong>convert text to MP3</strong> format! Some TTS readers will not allow for this without you paying the premium price, but most will at least offer a limited MP3 conversion feature (usually one that limits the length of conversion or the quality).</p>

In this next part, we’ll be focusing on “super tips”</p>
<p>OR, tips that allow you to generally make the most of these <strong>text-to-human voice converters</strong> to the fullest!</p>
<p><strong>Tip 1: Use AI Text-to-Speech!</strong></p>
<p>Our first tip is to encourage you to take full advantage of AI text-to-speech functions. Artificial Intelligence allows the converted text to sound much nicer and much more like it was read by an actual human being — which enables you to create a very professional-sounding project without having to hire a voiceover actor&#x2F;actress.</p>

                      alt="Artificial Intelligence (AI) in Text-to-Speech"
                ></p>
<p><strong>Tip 2: Language and Regions Settings!</strong></p>
<p>If your content is available in multiple languages and you want to convert all of the different editions of said content, you’ll need to find a converter that supports all of those languages. You may also consider looking for regional support as well. For example, for basic English language, most TTS converters usually have “American” voices as well as “British” voices to support different accents despite them using the same text.</p>
<p><img  
                     lazyload
                     src="/images/loading.svg"

                      alt="Language and Regions Settings"
                ></p>
<p><strong>Tip 3: Pick an Appropriate Voice!</strong></p>
<p>The voice you choose to read your text is also very important. Some premium <strong>text-to-human voice converters</strong> offer a great variety to choose from to give you options when it comes to what kind of voice you want to read your content.</p>
<p><img  
                     lazyload
                     src="/images/loading.svg"
                     data-src="https://images.wondershare.com/filmora/article-images/2022/01/Super%20Tips%20on%20Converting%20Text%20to%20MP3-11.png"
                      alt="TTS Voices Settings"
                ></p>
<p><strong>Tip 4: Audio Settings!</strong></p>
<p>This is a bit of a rare feature, but some TTS converters will allow you to adjust your audio before it converts your <strong>content from text to speech (MP3)</strong>. Sometimes, this is as simple as allowing you to choose an audio format (as is shown in the image below), other times, it allows you to control the actual sound quality of the finished product.</p>
<p><img  
                     lazyload
                     src="/images/loading.svg"
                     data-src="https://images.wondershare.com/filmora/article-images/2022/01/Super%20Tips%20on%20Converting%20Text%20to%20MP3-12.png"
                      alt="TTS Audio Settings"
                ></p>
<p><strong>Tip 5: Adjust Voice Speed!</strong></p>
<p>Earlier, we emphasized the importance of choosing your voice reader carefully! Now, we focus on the subject of speed. Some voices are better when they are slowed down, others are better when sped up. Play around with these settings to see which way is more natural for your chosen voice!</p>
<p><img  
                     lazyload
                     src="/images/loading.svg"
                     data-src="https://images.wondershare.com/filmora/article-images/2022/01/Super%20Tips%20on%20Converting%20Text%20to%20MP3-13.png"
                      alt="TTS Voice Speed Settings"
                ></p>
<p><strong>Tip 6: Adjust Voice Pitch</strong></p>
<p>To allow for even more flexibility when it comes to voice style, you’ll find that some TTS converters will allow you to adjust voice pitch! This is a helpful feature for when you’re looking for that particular voice type, as it will allow you to experiment more with the kind of sound you want your content to be known for.</p>
<p><img  
                     lazyload
                     src="/images/loading.svg"

                      alt="Voice Pitch Settings"
                ></p>
<p><strong>Tip 7: Voice Effects Options!</strong></p>
<p>Another advanced feature that you might run into (and should definitely take advantage of), is voice effects! This, again, will allow you to fully customize the type of voice that your content is known for. It’s also great for when you’re aiming for a more natural sound (if you’re patient enough in order to take full advantage of it!)</p>
<p><img  
                     lazyload

                      alt="Voice Effects Options"
                ></p>
<p><strong>Tip 8: Use Advanced Video Editing!</strong></p>
<p>Our last tip is not on the subject of using a TTS converter itself, but on the tool, you use in order to create your final project! For that, we recommend <strong><a class="link"   target="_blank" rel="noopener" href="https://tools.techidaily.com/wondershare/filmora/download/" >Wondershare Filmora Video Editor <i class="fa-regular fa-arrow-up-right-from-square fa-sm"></i></a></strong>.</p>

<p>Text-to-Speech is an ingenious accessibility invention that has only grown more and more popular as AI has been thrown in the mix — making the converted speech sound more natural than ever!</p>
<p>As requested, in this article, we’ll be focusing on the subject of <strong>converting text to MP3</strong> format (or, rather, a tangible file that you can use for projects!)</p>

<h2 id="Part-1-What-is-TTS-1"><a href="#Part-1-What-is-TTS-1" class="headerlink" title="Part 1 What is TTS?"></a>Part 1 <strong>What is TTS?</strong></h2><p>What is Text-to-Speech? Text-to-Speech, also called TTS, as previously mentioned, is an accessibility invention. It was developed to help those with vision impairment or blindness — giving them the ability to have text read to them out loud to them (without requiring someone specifically read it out loud for them.</p>
<p>More recent development in TTS technology has allowed it to grow more useful outside of those parameters, however. Especially seeing as it is now possible to convert <strong>text to MP3 with natural voices</strong>.</p>
<h3 id="01Why-Use-Text-to-Speech-Converter-1"><a href="#01Why-Use-Text-to-Speech-Converter-1" class="headerlink" title="01Why Use Text to Speech Converter?"></a>01Why Use Text to Speech Converter?</h3><p><strong>Text-to-Speech human voice converter</strong>s are popular with content creators, and thus, they are the ones who see the most use for them (in the commercial sense). After all, it’s easy enough to convert already created content (in the form of text) into an audio file that there’s no reason not to! Especially since it means that more people would have access to their content!</p>

Getting a live voice actor to <strong>convert text to MP3</strong> for you is very expensive — since you’re paying not only for the voice-actors hours spent but also the use of the expensive equipment that they use for creating voiceovers.</p>
<p>In that regard, even PAID text-to-speech converters are easier on the budget. Making it the perfect solution for content creators who want to increase the accessibility of their content but do not have the time (to create the voiceovers themselves) or the money (to hire someone else to record it).</p>

And, depending on what you’re looking for, you might find yourself longing for extra features later on down the line. That is why, when looking to <strong>convert text to MP3</strong> we recommend considering the following:</p>
<p><strong>●</strong> <strong>Converting Time</strong>: How fast does the converter work? Most text-to-speech converters work almost instantaneously! So, if the one you’re using currently is slow? It might be best to give it a pass over to the next candidate.</p>
<p><strong>●</strong> <strong>Sound Quality</strong>: You should also test out whether or not the sound quality of the converted text to speech is good.</p>
<p><strong>●</strong> <strong>Multi-Language Support</strong>: Since this is all for the sake of increasing accessibility, you should start thinking about how many languages your converter supports as well. You might not be able to use all of them or even want to. But, that extra function can be helpful for the future.</p>
<p><strong>●</strong> <strong>Voice-Control Options</strong>: Does the converter offers you advanced voice controls? Your average converter usually offers speed and voice options, but you might find that a text-to-speech converter with more advanced options (i.e., tone, pitch, etc. controls) may help you get better quality content in the long run.</p>

Specifically, a FREEmium text-to-speech converter that you can use when you’re still on the trying-out stage! This part will include a tutorial and a short introduction:</p>

Most <strong>text-to-human voice converter</strong>s function much the same way. The main difference usually being on the number of features focused and the limitations imposed (for tools with FREEmium services that impose limits on the FREE version, like the tool we’ll be using for our example):</p>
<p><strong>Step 1: Upload Text</strong></p>
<p>First, upload the text that you want to convert into speech!</p>
<p>Most online converters offer a text box that you can use in order to copy &amp; paste the text onto (like in the image below), while others offer an ‘upload’ feature that you can use to upload text from a document.</p>
<p><img  
                     lazyload

                      alt="Upload or Copy &amp; Paste Text"
                ></p>
<p><strong>Step 2: Adjust Voice Reader!</strong></p>
<p>Next, the main thing that you usually have to worry about is the voice options.</p>
<p>Most TTS converters at least offer the opportunity to choose what voice you want the text to be read in. Some, more advanced solutions, may offer voices in other languages, dialects, accents, etc. as well as voice control options (tone, pitch, etc.)</p>
<p><img  
                     lazyload

                      alt="Set Voice Reader"
                ></p>
<p><strong>Step 3: Reader Controls!</strong></p>
<p>Outside of voice options, most text-to-speech converters also offer the ability to control the general outcome of the converted text to speech.</p>
<p>More advanced tools will have multiple options on offer for this, but even the most basic ones at least offer a method for controlling the speed at which the text is read by the voice you’ve chosen!</p>

                     lazyload

                      alt="Adjust Speech Controls"
                ></p>
<p><strong>Step 4: Convert Text to MP3!</strong></p>
<p>Now is finally the time to <strong>convert text to MP3</strong> format! Some TTS readers will not allow for this without you paying the premium price, but most will at least offer a limited MP3 conversion feature (usually one that limits the length of conversion or the quality).</p>

In this next part, we’ll be focusing on “super tips”</p>
<p>OR, tips that allow you to generally make the most of these <strong>text-to-human voice converters</strong> to the fullest!</p>
<p><strong>Tip 1: Use AI Text-to-Speech!</strong></p>
<p>Our first tip is to encourage you to take full advantage of AI text-to-speech functions. Artificial Intelligence allows the converted text to sound much nicer and much more like it was read by an actual human being — which enables you to create a very professional-sounding project without having to hire a voiceover actor&#x2F;actress.</p>

                ></p>
<p><strong>Tip 2: Language and Regions Settings!</strong></p>
<p>If your content is available in multiple languages and you want to convert all of the different editions of said content, you’ll need to find a converter that supports all of those languages. You may also consider looking for regional support as well. For example, for basic English language, most TTS converters usually have “American” voices as well as “British” voices to support different accents despite them using the same text.</p>

                      alt="Language and Regions Settings"
                ></p>
<p><strong>Tip 3: Pick an Appropriate Voice!</strong></p>
<p>The voice you choose to read your text is also very important. Some premium <strong>text-to-human voice converters</strong> offer a great variety to choose from to give you options when it comes to what kind of voice you want to read your content.</p>

                ></p>
<p><strong>Tip 4: Audio Settings!</strong></p>
<p>This is a bit of a rare feature, but some TTS converters will allow you to adjust your audio before it converts your <strong>content from text to speech (MP3)</strong>. Sometimes, this is as simple as allowing you to choose an audio format (as is shown in the image below), other times, it allows you to control the actual sound quality of the finished product.</p>

                      alt="TTS Audio Settings"
                ></p>
<p><strong>Tip 5: Adjust Voice Speed!</strong></p>
<p>Earlier, we emphasized the importance of choosing your voice reader carefully! Now, we focus on the subject of speed. Some voices are better when they are slowed down, others are better when sped up. Play around with these settings to see which way is more natural for your chosen voice!</p>

                      alt="TTS Voice Speed Settings"
                ></p>
<p><strong>Tip 6: Adjust Voice Pitch</strong></p>
<p>To allow for even more flexibility when it comes to voice style, you’ll find that some TTS converters will allow you to adjust voice pitch! This is a helpful feature for when you’re looking for that particular voice type, as it will allow you to experiment more with the kind of sound you want your content to be known for.</p>
<p><img  
                     lazyload

                      alt="Voice Pitch Settings"
                ></p>
<p><strong>Tip 7: Voice Effects Options!</strong></p>
<p>Another advanced feature that you might run into (and should definitely take advantage of), is voice effects! This, again, will allow you to fully customize the type of voice that your content is known for. It’s also great for when you’re aiming for a more natural sound (if you’re patient enough in order to take full advantage of it!)</p>

                ></p>
<p><strong>Tip 8: Use Advanced Video Editing!</strong></p>
<p>Our last tip is not on the subject of using a TTS converter itself, but on the tool, you use in order to create your final project! For that, we recommend <strong><a class="link"   target="_blank" rel="noopener" href="https://tools.techidaily.com/wondershare/filmora/download/" >Wondershare Filmora Video Editor <i class="fa-regular fa-arrow-up-right-from-square fa-sm"></i></a></strong>.</p>

<p>Text-to-Speech is an ingenious accessibility invention that has only grown more and more popular as AI has been thrown in the mix — making the converted speech sound more natural than ever!</p>
<p>As requested, in this article, we’ll be focusing on the subject of <strong>converting text to MP3</strong> format (or, rather, a tangible file that you can use for projects!)</p>

<h2 id="Part-1-What-is-TTS-2"><a href="#Part-1-What-is-TTS-2" class="headerlink" title="Part 1 What is TTS?"></a>Part 1 <strong>What is TTS?</strong></h2><p>What is Text-to-Speech? Text-to-Speech, also called TTS, as previously mentioned, is an accessibility invention. It was developed to help those with vision impairment or blindness — giving them the ability to have text read to them out loud to them (without requiring someone specifically read it out loud for them.</p>
<p>More recent development in TTS technology has allowed it to grow more useful outside of those parameters, however. Especially seeing as it is now possible to convert <strong>text to MP3 with natural voices</strong>.</p>
<h3 id="01Why-Use-Text-to-Speech-Converter-2"><a href="#01Why-Use-Text-to-Speech-Converter-2" class="headerlink" title="01Why Use Text to Speech Converter?"></a>01Why Use Text to Speech Converter?</h3><p><strong>Text-to-Speech human voice converter</strong>s are popular with content creators, and thus, they are the ones who see the most use for them (in the commercial sense). After all, it’s easy enough to convert already created content (in the form of text) into an audio file that there’s no reason not to! Especially since it means that more people would have access to their content!</p>

Getting a live voice actor to <strong>convert text to MP3</strong> for you is very expensive — since you’re paying not only for the voice-actors hours spent but also the use of the expensive equipment that they use for creating voiceovers.</p>
<p>In that regard, even PAID text-to-speech converters are easier on the budget. Making it the perfect solution for content creators who want to increase the accessibility of their content but do not have the time (to create the voiceovers themselves) or the money (to hire someone else to record it).</p>

And, depending on what you’re looking for, you might find yourself longing for extra features later on down the line. That is why, when looking to <strong>convert text to MP3</strong> we recommend considering the following:</p>
<p><strong>●</strong> <strong>Converting Time</strong>: How fast does the converter work? Most text-to-speech converters work almost instantaneously! So, if the one you’re using currently is slow? It might be best to give it a pass over to the next candidate.</p>
<p><strong>●</strong> <strong>Sound Quality</strong>: You should also test out whether or not the sound quality of the converted text to speech is good.</p>
<p><strong>●</strong> <strong>Multi-Language Support</strong>: Since this is all for the sake of increasing accessibility, you should start thinking about how many languages your converter supports as well. You might not be able to use all of them or even want to. But, that extra function can be helpful for the future.</p>
<p><strong>●</strong> <strong>Voice-Control Options</strong>: Does the converter offers you advanced voice controls? Your average converter usually offers speed and voice options, but you might find that a text-to-speech converter with more advanced options (i.e., tone, pitch, etc. controls) may help you get better quality content in the long run.</p>

Specifically, a FREEmium text-to-speech converter that you can use when you’re still on the trying-out stage! This part will include a tutorial and a short introduction:</p>
<h3 id="014-Steps-to-Use-and-Convert-Text-to-Speech-Online-Free-Unlimited-2"><a href="#014-Steps-to-Use-and-Convert-Text-to-Speech-Online-Free-Unlimited-2" class="headerlink" title="014 Steps to Use and Convert Text to Speech Online Free Unlimited?"></a>014 Steps to Use and Convert Text to Speech Online Free Unlimited?</h3><p>First, for the promised tutorial! Most <strong>text-to-human voice converter</strong>s function much the same way. The main difference usually being on the number of features focused and the limitations imposed (for tools with FREEmium services that impose limits on the FREE version, like the tool we’ll be using for our example):</p>
<p><strong>Step 1: Upload Text</strong></p>
<p>First, upload the text that you want to convert into speech!</p>
<p>Most online converters offer a text box that you can use in order to copy &amp; paste the text onto (like in the image below), while others offer an ‘upload’ feature that you can use to upload text from a document.</p>
<p><img  
                     lazyload

                      alt="Upload or Copy &amp; Paste Text"
                ></p>
<p><strong>Step 2: Adjust Voice Reader!</strong></p>
<p>Next, the main thing that you usually have to worry about is the voice options.</p>
<p>Most TTS converters at least offer the opportunity to choose what voice you want the text to be read in. Some, more advanced solutions, may offer voices in other languages, dialects, accents, etc. as well as voice control options (tone, pitch, etc.)</p>
<p><img  
                     lazyload

                      alt="Set Voice Reader"
                ></p>
<p><strong>Step 3: Reader Controls!</strong></p>
<p>Outside of voice options, most text-to-speech converters also offer the ability to control the general outcome of the converted text to speech.</p>
<p>More advanced tools will have multiple options on offer for this, but even the most basic ones at least offer a method for controlling the speed at which the text is read by the voice you’ve chosen!</p>
<p><img  
                     lazyload

                      alt="Adjust Speech Controls"
                ></p>
<p><strong>Step 4: Convert Text to MP3!</strong></p>
<p>Now is finally the time to <strong>convert text to MP3</strong> format! Some TTS readers will not allow for this without you paying the premium price, but most will at least offer a limited MP3 conversion feature (usually one that limits the length of conversion or the quality).</p>

In this next part, we’ll be focusing on “super tips”</p>
<p>OR, tips that allow you to generally make the most of these <strong>text-to-human voice converters</strong> to the fullest!</p>
<p><strong>Tip 1: Use AI Text-to-Speech!</strong></p>
<p>Our first tip is to encourage you to take full advantage of AI text-to-speech functions. Artificial Intelligence allows the converted text to sound much nicer and much more like it was read by an actual human being — which enables you to create a very professional-sounding project without having to hire a voiceover actor&#x2F;actress.</p>
<p><img

                      alt="Artificial Intelligence (AI) in Text-to-Speech"
                ></p>
<p><strong>Tip 2: Language and Regions Settings!</strong></p>
<p>If your content is available in multiple languages and you want to convert all of the different editions of said content, you’ll need to find a converter that supports all of those languages. You may also consider looking for regional support as well. For example, for basic English language, most TTS converters usually have “American” voices as well as “British” voices to support different accents despite them using the same text.</p>
<p><img  
                     lazyload
                     src="/images/loading.svg"

                      alt="Language and Regions Settings"
                ></p>
<p><strong>Tip 3: Pick an Appropriate Voice!</strong></p>
<p>The voice you choose to read your text is also very important. Some premium <strong>text-to-human voice converters</strong> offer a great variety to choose from to give you options when it comes to what kind of voice you want to read your content.</p>

                ></p>
<p><strong>Tip 4: Audio Settings!</strong></p>
<p>This is a bit of a rare feature, but some TTS converters will allow you to adjust your audio before it converts your <strong>content from text to speech (MP3)</strong>. Sometimes, this is as simple as allowing you to choose an audio format (as is shown in the image below), other times, it allows you to control the actual sound quality of the finished product.</p>

                      alt="TTS Audio Settings"
                ></p>
<p><strong>Tip 5: Adjust Voice Speed!</strong></p>
<p>Earlier, we emphasized the importance of choosing your voice reader carefully! Now, we focus on the subject of speed. Some voices are better when they are slowed down, others are better when sped up. Play around with these settings to see which way is more natural for your chosen voice!</p>

                ></p>
<p><strong>Tip 6: Adjust Voice Pitch</strong></p>
<p>To allow for even more flexibility when it comes to voice style, you’ll find that some TTS converters will allow you to adjust voice pitch! This is a helpful feature for when you’re looking for that particular voice type, as it will allow you to experiment more with the kind of sound you want your content to be known for.</p>

<p><strong>Tip 7: Voice Effects Options!</strong></p>
<p>Another advanced feature that you might run into (and should definitely take advantage of), is voice effects! This, again, will allow you to fully customize the type of voice that your content is known for. It’s also great for when you’re aiming for a more natural sound (if you’re patient enough in order to take full advantage of it!)</p>

<p><strong>●</strong> Most of these text-to-speech converters work in much the same way. All you need to do is upload the text you want to convert, adjust the voice and sound settings as needed, and you’re done!</p>
<p><strong>●</strong> Of course, there are some extra little tidbits that you might also want to know in order to enhance your converted text. Our general advice for that is to experiment to the fullest and make sure that you finish everything up with a high-quality video editor like Filmora to ensure that your finished project is as near to perfect as possible!</p>

<p>Text-to-Speech is an ingenious accessibility invention that has only grown more and more popular as AI has been thrown in the mix — making the converted speech sound more natural than ever!</p>
<p>As requested, in this article, we’ll be focusing on the subject of <strong>converting text to MP3</strong> format (or, rather, a tangible file that you can use for projects!)</p>

<h2 id="Part-1-What-is-TTS-3"><a href="#Part-1-What-is-TTS-3" class="headerlink" title="Part 1 What is TTS?"></a>Part 1 <strong>What is TTS?</strong></h2><p>What is Text-to-Speech? Text-to-Speech, also called TTS, as previously mentioned, is an accessibility invention. It was developed to help those with vision impairment or blindness — giving them the ability to have text read to them out loud to them (without requiring someone specifically read it out loud for them.</p>
<p>More recent development in TTS technology has allowed it to grow more useful outside of those parameters, however. Especially seeing as it is now possible to convert <strong>text to MP3 with natural voices</strong>.</p>
<h3 id="01Why-Use-Text-to-Speech-Converter-3"><a href="#01Why-Use-Text-to-Speech-Converter-3" class="headerlink" title="01Why Use Text to Speech Converter?"></a>01Why Use Text to Speech Converter?</h3><p><strong>Text-to-Speech human voice converter</strong>s are popular with content creators, and thus, they are the ones who see the most use for them (in the commercial sense). After all, it’s easy enough to convert already created content (in the form of text) into an audio file that there’s no reason not to! Especially since it means that more people would have access to their content!</p>

Getting a live voice actor to <strong>convert text to MP3</strong> for you is very expensive — since you’re paying not only for the voice-actors hours spent but also the use of the expensive equipment that they use for creating voiceovers.</p>
<p>In that regard, even PAID text-to-speech converters are easier on the budget. Making it the perfect solution for content creators who want to increase the accessibility of their content but do not have the time (to create the voiceovers themselves) or the money (to hire someone else to record it).</p>

And, depending on what you’re looking for, you might find yourself longing for extra features later on down the line. That is why, when looking to <strong>convert text to MP3</strong> we recommend considering the following:</p>
<p><strong>●</strong> <strong>Converting Time</strong>: How fast does the converter work? Most text-to-speech converters work almost instantaneously! So, if the one you’re using currently is slow? It might be best to give it a pass over to the next candidate.</p>
<p><strong>●</strong> <strong>Sound Quality</strong>: You should also test out whether or not the sound quality of the converted text to speech is good.</p>
<p><strong>●</strong> <strong>Multi-Language Support</strong>: Since this is all for the sake of increasing accessibility, you should start thinking about how many languages your converter supports as well. You might not be able to use all of them or even want to. But, that extra function can be helpful for the future.</p>
<p><strong>●</strong> <strong>Voice-Control Options</strong>: Does the converter offers you advanced voice controls? Your average converter usually offers speed and voice options, but you might find that a text-to-speech converter with more advanced options (i.e., tone, pitch, etc. controls) may help you get better quality content in the long run.</p>

Specifically, a FREEmium text-to-speech converter that you can use when you’re still on the trying-out stage! This part will include a tutorial and a short introduction:</p>
<h3 id="014-Steps-to-Use-and-Convert-Text-to-Speech-Online-Free-Unlimited-3"><a href="#014-Steps-to-Use-and-Convert-Text-to-Speech-Online-Free-Unlimited-3" class="headerlink" title="014 Steps to Use and Convert Text to Speech Online Free Unlimited?"></a>014 Steps to Use and Convert Text to Speech Online Free Unlimited?</h3><p>First, for the promised tutorial! Most <strong>text-to-human voice converter</strong>s function much the same way. The main difference usually being on the number of features focused and the limitations imposed (for tools with FREEmium services that impose limits on the FREE version, like the tool we’ll be using for our example):</p>
<p><strong>Step 1: Upload Text</strong></p>
<p>First, upload the text that you want to convert into speech!</p>
<p>Most online converters offer a text box that you can use in order to copy &amp; paste the text onto (like in the image below), while others offer an ‘upload’ feature that you can use to upload text from a document.</p>
<p><img  
                     lazyload
                     src="/images/loading.svg"

                      alt="Upload or Copy &amp; Paste Text"
                ></p>
<p><strong>Step 2: Adjust Voice Reader!</strong></p>
<p>Next, the main thing that you usually have to worry about is the voice options.</p>
<p>Most TTS converters at least offer the opportunity to choose what voice you want the text to be read in. Some, more advanced solutions, may offer voices in other languages, dialects, accents, etc. as well as voice control options (tone, pitch, etc.)</p>
<p><img  
                     lazyload

                      alt="Set Voice Reader"
                ></p>
<p><strong>Step 3: Reader Controls!</strong></p>
<p>Outside of voice options, most text-to-speech converters also offer the ability to control the general outcome of the converted text to speech.</p>
<p>More advanced tools will have multiple options on offer for this, but even the most basic ones at least offer a method for controlling the speed at which the text is read by the voice you’ve chosen!</p>
<p><img  
                     lazyload
                     src="/images/loading.svg"

                      alt="Adjust Speech Controls"
                ></p>
<p><strong>Step 4: Convert Text to MP3!</strong></p>
<p>Now is finally the time to <strong>convert text to MP3</strong> format! Some TTS readers will not allow for this without you paying the premium price, but most will at least offer a limited MP3 conversion feature (usually one that limits the length of conversion or the quality).</p>

In this next part, we’ll be focusing on “super tips”</p>
<p>OR, tips that allow you to generally make the most of these <strong>text-to-human voice converters</strong> to the fullest!</p>
<p><strong>Tip 1: Use AI Text-to-Speech!</strong></p>
<p>Our first tip is to encourage you to take full advantage of AI text-to-speech functions. Artificial Intelligence allows the converted text to sound much nicer and much more like it was read by an actual human being — which enables you to create a very professional-sounding project without having to hire a voiceover actor&#x2F;actress.</p>
<p><img  
                     lazyload
                     src="/images/loading.svg"
                     data-src="https://images.wondershare.com/filmora/article-images/2022/01/Super%20Tips%20on%20Converting%20Text%20to%20MP3-9.png"
                      alt="Artificial Intelligence (AI) in Text-to-Speech"
                ></p>
<p><strong>Tip 2: Language and Regions Settings!</strong></p>
<p>If your content is available in multiple languages and you want to convert all of the different editions of said content, you’ll need to find a converter that supports all of those languages. You may also consider looking for regional support as well. For example, for basic English language, most TTS converters usually have “American” voices as well as “British” voices to support different accents despite them using the same text.</p>
<p><img  
                     lazyload
                     src="/images/loading.svg"
                     data-src="https://images.wondershare.com/filmora/article-images/2022/01/Super%20Tips%20on%20Converting%20Text%20to%20MP3-10.png"
                      alt="Language and Regions Settings"
                ></p>
<p><strong>Tip 3: Pick an Appropriate Voice!</strong></p>
<p>The voice you choose to read your text is also very important. Some premium <strong>text-to-human voice converters</strong> offer a great variety to choose from to give you options when it comes to what kind of voice you want to read your content.</p>
<p><img  
                     lazyload
                     src="/images/loading.svg"

                      alt="TTS Voices Settings"
                ></p>
<p><strong>Tip 4: Audio Settings!</strong></p>
<p>This is a bit of a rare feature, but some TTS converters will allow you to adjust your audio before it converts your <strong>content from text to speech (MP3)</strong>. Sometimes, this is as simple as allowing you to choose an audio format (as is shown in the image below), other times, it allows you to control the actual sound quality of the finished product.</p>
<p><img  
                     lazyload
                     src="/images/loading.svg"

                      alt="TTS Audio Settings"
                ></p>
<p><strong>Tip 5: Adjust Voice Speed!</strong></p>
<p>Earlier, we emphasized the importance of choosing your voice reader carefully! Now, we focus on the subject of speed. Some voices are better when they are slowed down, others are better when sped up. Play around with these settings to see which way is more natural for your chosen voice!</p>
<p><img  
                     lazyload
                     src="/images/loading.svg"

                      alt="TTS Voice Speed Settings"
                ></p>
<p><strong>Tip 6: Adjust Voice Pitch</strong></p>
<p>To allow for even more flexibility when it comes to voice style, you’ll find that some TTS converters will allow you to adjust voice pitch! This is a helpful feature for when you’re looking for that particular voice type, as it will allow you to experiment more with the kind of sound you want your content to be known for.</p>
<p><img  
                     lazyload
                     src="/images/loading.svg"

                      alt="Voice Pitch Settings"
                ></p>
<p><strong>Tip 7: Voice Effects Options!</strong></p>
<p>Another advanced feature that you might run into (and should definitely take advantage of), is voice effects! This, again, will allow you to fully customize the type of voice that your content is known for. It’s also great for when you’re aiming for a more natural sound (if you’re patient enough in order to take full advantage of it!)</p>
<p><img  
                     lazyload

                      alt="Voice Effects Options"
                ></p>
<p><strong>Tip 8: Use Advanced Video Editing!</strong></p>
<p>Our last tip is not on the subject of using a TTS converter itself, but on the tool, you use in order to create your final project! For that, we recommend <strong><a class="link"   target="_blank" rel="noopener" href="https://tools.techidaily.com/wondershare/filmora/download/" >Wondershare Filmora Video Editor <i class="fa-regular fa-arrow-up-right-from-square fa-sm"></i></a></strong>.</p>
<p>Filmora is a content creation tool that will allow you to expand your video editing capabilities with little to no effort. It’s highly intuitive and thus incredibly very easy to use — allowing you to create and perfect your content efficiently! It’s also, in this case, very good at ensuring that you can make full use of your carefully curated TTS MP3!</p>

<p> Finding an image you like on the Internet doesn’t take long, since almost every website you can stumble upon, contains at least one picture. This doesn’t mean that you can just download any photo and use it in your blog, online marketing campaign or for any other purpose. Moreover, stock image websites like Getty Images or iStock let you purchase the right to use a photo commercially. As a reaction to an expanding stock image industry, many photographers, museums and cultural institutions are choosing to forfeit their rights and to publish public domain images. So, in this article, we are going to take you through the ten best public domain image websites where you can download pictures for free.</p>
<h2 id="What-Are-Public-Domain-Images"><a href="#What-Are-Public-Domain-Images" class="headerlink" title="What Are Public Domain Images?"></a>What Are Public Domain Images?</h2><p> By definition, public domain images are photos, vectors or clip art that are available to anyone because their copyright has either expired or they never had a copyright owner. Consequently, anyone can use these images for both commercial or private projects without having to purchase the rights to do so. An image can enter a public domain under the following circumstances:</p>
<ul>
<li>Scientists, educators or artists can use the Creative Commons Zero (CC0) license to dedicate their images to the public domain</li>
<li>A picture’s copyright is no longer in effect</li>
<li>A photo was never the subject to copyright</li>
</ul>
<p> It is of utmost importance to check if an image is within the public domain before you use it publicly in order to avoid potential legal complications.</p>
<h2 id="How-and-Where-to-Find-Public-Domain-Images"><a href="#How-and-Where-to-Find-Public-Domain-Images" class="headerlink" title="How and Where to Find Public Domain Images?"></a>How and Where to Find Public Domain Images?</h2><p> A simple google search will reveal hundreds of websites that let you download public domain and royalty-free images. Which source you’re going to use depends on the type of image you’re looking for, since some websites are dedicated only to photography, while others feature impressive collections of public domain images of artworks. In addition, you’ll only want to download public domain images from the websites that offer information about the author because using a public domain image without crediting its author is strictly prohibited.</p>
<h2 id="Best-Websites-for-Downloading-Public-Domain-Images"><a href="#Best-Websites-for-Downloading-Public-Domain-Images" class="headerlink" title="Best Websites for Downloading Public Domain Images"></a>Best Websites for Downloading Public Domain Images</h2><p> We’ve searched the Internet and we utilized our results to compile a collection of the most reliable websites that grant its users access to vast numbers of public domain images. Let’s take a look at some of the best websites that let you download public domain images.</p>

                ></p>
<p> Graphic designers and all other creatives in constant need of a fresh supply of public domain images don’t need a special introduction to Pexels. The stock image platform is dedicated to photography and video, so you can’t use it to search for vectors or clip art. Even so, you can use Pexles to search for public domain images based on a particular keyword or browse through its collection of free images and discover photos spontaneously. Clicking on the Popular Searches tab will enable you to see the images from Light, Nature or Animals and it will shorten the amount of time you have to spend looking for a photo you want to download.</p>
<p><strong>Pros:</strong></p>
<ul>
<li>Neatly organized website</li>
<li>Free and easy sign-up</li>
<li>Offers a huge selection of free public domain images and videos according to the CC0 license</li>

<p> Besides offering an impressive collection of royalty-free photos, Pixabay also lets you search for public domain vectors, illustrations, and videos. The website hosts more than a million high-resolution photos and videos you can download for free. To make things even better, becoming a member of the Pixabay’s community and creating an account on this platform won’t take more than a few minutes of your time. Pixabay also offers advanced search tools that enable you to combine searches, search for the author of an image or group search terms. In addition, you can also browse through the photographers that contribute their images to the platform on a regular basis.</p>
<p><strong>Pros:</strong></p>
<ul>
<li>Powerful search tools and various filters</li>

                      alt="wikimedia commons "
                ></p>
<p> This is probably the largest website on the Internet where you can download public domain images. There are more than 49 million images, illustrations, vector graphics and videos available that can be downloaded for free. Some media files on Wikimedia Commons have certain restrictions, but these restrictions are mostly related to image citations, which means that you can use them only if you credit the author. Such a huge selection of media files can be overwhelming for the newcomers to the Wikimedia Commons platform, but once you grow accustomed to the website’s interface discovering images becomes a straightforward process.</p>
<p><strong>Pros:</strong></p>
<ul>
<li>All images are available in high resolution</li>
<li>Nearly all images can be used without any restrictions</li>
</ul>
<p><strong>Cons:</strong></p>

                ></p>
<p> For more than a decade Flickr has been a popular online destination for photographers in need of a platform that enables them to present their work. The Flickr Commons is a project that unites more than a hundred institutions in an effort to create a library of public domain images. The project makes available a stunning amount of historical photographs and it grants you access to highly esteemed collections of photographs. Flick Commons is perfectly suited for researchers and scholars in need of public domain photos, they can use in their essays or research papers.</p>
<p><strong>Pros:</strong></p>
<ul>
<li>Unlimited access to historical photos</li>
<li>Extends the knowledge available to the general public</li>

                      alt="Unsplash public domain image  "
                ></p>
<p> With a library that contains over 800,000 photos, Unsplash is easily one of the largest websites that offer public domain images. All pictures on this platform are organized into different categories, which makes finding a photo you want to use in a commercial or non-commercial project a relatively simple process. Alternatively, you can insert a keyword into a search bar and Unsplash will show you the results within seconds. However, the images you can find on this platform are similar to those you can purchase on stock photography websites, although some of them have an artistic touch that is hard to find on the majority of stock photos.</p>
<p><strong>Pros:</strong></p>
<ul>
<li>Excellent source of high-resolution photos</li>
<li>Quick and easy search</li>
</ul>
<p><strong>Cons:</strong></p>

This is a private collection of 2,600 images that are hard to find anywhere else on the Internet. You can browse through woodcuts, old texts or old holiday images, which makes this platform an excellent choice for anyone interested in rare images that were featured in old books. All pictures you can find on the From Old Books website are free to use on non-commercial projects, but you must pay a small fee if you want to download a high-resolution image you can use on a commercial project.</p>
<ul>
<li>Images are organized into categories</li>
<li>Access to rare images</li>
</ul>
<p><strong>Cons</strong></p>
<ul>
<li>Some images are not free</li>
<li>Rudimentary website design</li>
</ul>

                      alt="Morguefile public domain image  "
                ></p>
<p> Morguefile is a website that offers stock footage to its users, but some of the images can’t be downloaded for free. That’s why you must click on the Free Photos tab before you start searching for public domain images on this website. The website hosts nearly 400.000 photos, videos, and vector graphics, but you must make sure that a file you want to download is within the public domain before you download it. The only downside is that the images aren’t organized into categories which can make finding the images you’re searching for more difficult than it needs to be.</p>
<p><strong>Pros:</strong></p>
<ul>
<li>Creating an account on Morguefile is free</li>
<li>All free photos can be used on commercial projects</li>
</ul>
<p><strong>Cons:</strong></p>
<ul>
<li>Images can be organized better</li>
<li>Fewer free images than on other public domain image websites</li>
</ul>
<h4 id="8-Public-Domain-Archive"><a href="#8-Public-Domain-Archive" class="headerlink" title="8.

All photos are organized into categories like abstract, free stock photos, people or wood which makes the search simpler. However, these categories don’t contain more than a few hundred photos and some of them offer as few as five pictures you can download. All photos are in high resolution and ready for professional use. The download process can be completed effortlessly in just a few quick steps. New images are added on a weekly basis.</p>
<p><strong>Pros:</strong></p>
<ul>
<li>Professional quality of images</li>
<li>All images are free</li>
</ul>
<p><strong>Cons:</strong></p>
<ul>
<li>A limited selection of photos</li>

However, the amount of public domain images this website offers is limited and if you want to download the images from the collections of works created by famous artists from the late 19th and early 20th centuries you must purchase the premium version of Viintage. The website lacks some basic search options as it only allows you to type in the search term into the search bar. The images are not organized into categories which further complicates the process of finding a public domain image you’re looking for.</p>
<p><strong>Pros:</strong></p>
<ul>
<li>Offers a collection of rare vintage public domain images</li>
<li>A great resource for graphic designers</li>

<p><strong>Cons:</strong></p>

<li>The title of the image</li>
<li>Author’s name</li>
<li>Information about the institution at which an image is kept</li>
<li>The source from which you acquired an image</li>
</ul>
<p> In case you don’t have access to all of these information or if the information is simply not available you should include all details about a public domain image you have the access to. Furthermore, there are several styles of image citations that depend on the source from which an image was acquired.</p>

<p> Spending large sums of money on images you can use in commercial or private projects is not always necessary.

                ></p>
<p> With a library that contains over 800,000 photos, Unsplash is easily one of the largest websites that offer public domain images. All pictures on this platform are organized into different categories, which makes finding a photo you want to use in a commercial or non-commercial project a relatively simple process. Alternatively, you can insert a keyword into a search bar and Unsplash will show you the results within seconds. However, the images you can find on this platform are similar to those you can purchase on stock photography websites, although some of them have an artistic touch that is hard to find on the majority of stock photos.</p>

You can browse through woodcuts, old texts or old holiday images, which makes this platform an excellent choice for anyone interested in rare images that were featured in old books. All pictures you can find on the From Old Books website are free to use on non-commercial projects, but you must pay a small fee if you want to download a high-resolution image you can use on a commercial project.</p>
<ul>
<li>Images are organized into categories</li>
<li>Access to rare images</li>

<p><strong>Cons</strong></p>

                ></p>
<p> Morguefile is a website that offers stock footage to its users, but some of the images can’t be downloaded for free. That’s why you must click on the Free Photos tab before you start searching for public domain images on this website. The website hosts nearly 400.000 photos, videos, and vector graphics, but you must make sure that a file you want to download is within the public domain before you download it. The only downside is that the images aren’t organized into categories which can make finding the images you’re searching for more difficult than it needs to be.</p>
<p><strong>Pros:</strong></p>
<ul>
<li>Creating an account on Morguefile is free</li>

</ul>

All photos are organized into categories like abstract, free stock photos, people or wood which makes the search simpler. However, these categories don’t contain more than a few hundred photos and some of them offer as few as five pictures you can download. All photos are in high resolution and ready for professional use. The download process can be completed effortlessly in just a few quick steps. New images are added on a weekly basis.</p>
<p><strong>Pros:</strong></p>
<ul>

However, the amount of public domain images this website offers is limited and if you want to download the images from the collections of works created by famous artists from the late 19th and early 20th centuries you must purchase the premium version of Viintage. The website lacks some basic search options as it only allows you to type in the search term into the search bar. The images are not organized into categories which further complicates the process of finding a public domain image you’re looking for.</p>
<p><strong>Pros:</strong></p>
<ul>
<li>Offers a collection of rare vintage public domain images</li>
<li>A great resource for graphic designers</li>

<p><strong>Cons:</strong></p>

<p> Finding an image you like on the Internet doesn’t take long, since almost every website you can stumble upon, contains at least one picture. This doesn’t mean that you can just download any photo and use it in your blog, online marketing campaign or for any other purpose. Moreover, stock image websites like Getty Images or iStock let you purchase the right to use a photo commercially. As a reaction to an expanding stock image industry, many photographers, museums and cultural institutions are choosing to forfeit their rights and to publish public domain images. So, in this article, we are going to take you through the ten best public domain image websites where you can download pictures for free.</p>
<h2 id="What-Are-Public-Domain-Images-2"><a href="#What-Are-Public-Domain-Images-2" class="headerlink" title="What Are Public Domain Images?"></a>What Are Public Domain Images?</h2><p> By definition, public domain images are photos, vectors or clip art that are available to anyone because their copyright has either expired or they never had a copyright owner. Consequently, anyone can use these images for both commercial or private projects without having to purchase the rights to do so. An image can enter a public domain under the following circumstances:</p>
<ul>
<li>Scientists, educators or artists can use the Creative Commons Zero (CC0) license to dedicate their images to the public domain</li>
<li>A picture’s copyright is no longer in effect</li>
<li>A photo was never the subject to copyright</li>
</ul>
<p> It is of utmost importance to check if an image is within the public domain before you use it publicly in order to avoid potential legal complications.</p>

Which source you’re going to use depends on the type of image you’re looking for, since some websites are dedicated only to photography, while others feature impressive collections of public domain images of artworks. In addition, you’ll only want to download public domain images from the websites that offer information about the author because using a public domain image without crediting its author is strictly prohibited.</p>

The website lacks some basic search options as it only allows you to type in the search term into the search bar.

<li>Author’s name</li>
<li>Information about the institution at which an image is kept</li>
<li>The source from which you acquired an image</li>

<p> Finding an image you like on the Internet doesn’t take long, since almost every website you can stumble upon, contains at least one picture. This doesn’t mean that you can just download any photo and use it in your blog, online marketing campaign or for any other purpose. Moreover, stock image websites like Getty Images or iStock let you purchase the right to use a photo commercially. As a reaction to an expanding stock image industry, many photographers, museums and cultural institutions are choosing to forfeit their rights and to publish public domain images. So, in this article, we are going to take you through the ten best public domain image websites where you can download pictures for free.</p>
<h2 id="What-Are-Public-Domain-Images-3"><a href="#What-Are-Public-Domain-Images-3" class="headerlink" title="What Are Public Domain Images?"></a>What Are Public Domain Images?</h2><p> By definition, public domain images are photos, vectors or clip art that are available to anyone because their copyright has either expired or they never had a copyright owner. Consequently, anyone can use these images for both commercial or private projects without having to purchase the rights to do so. An image can enter a public domain under the following circumstances:</p>
<ul>
<li>Scientists, educators or artists can use the Creative Commons Zero (CC0) license to dedicate their images to the public domain</li>
<li>A picture’s copyright is no longer in effect</li>
<li>A photo was never the subject to copyright</li>
</ul>
<p> It is of utmost importance to check if an image is within the public domain before you use it publicly in order to avoid potential legal complications.</p>
<h2 id="How-and-Where-to-Find-Public-Domain-Images-3"><a href="#How-and-Where-to-Find-Public-Domain-Images-3" class="headerlink" title="How and Where to Find Public Domain Images?"></a>How and Where to Find Public Domain Images?</h2><p> A simple google search will reveal hundreds of websites that let you download public domain and royalty-free images. Which source you’re going to use depends on the type of image you’re looking for, since some websites are dedicated only to photography, while others feature impressive collections of public domain images of artworks. In addition, you’ll only want to download public domain images from the websites that offer information about the author because using a public domain image without crediting its author is strictly prohibited.</p>

However, the amount of public domain images this website offers is limited and if you want to download the images from the collections of works created by famous artists from the late 19th and early 20th centuries you must purchase the premium version of Viintage. The website lacks some basic search options as it only allows you to type in the search term into the search bar. The images are not organized into categories which further complicates the process of finding a public domain image you’re looking for.</p>
<p><strong>Pros:</strong></p>
<ul>
<li>Offers a collection of rare vintage public domain images</li>
<li>A great resource for graphic designers</li>
</ul>
<p><strong>Cons:</strong></p>
<ul>
<li>Most images on Viintage can’t be downloaded for free</li>
<li>Search tools are far from perfect</li>

The image citations should include the following information:</p>
<ul>
<li>The title of the image</li>
<li>Author’s name</li>
<li>Information about the institution at which an image is kept</li>
<li>The source from which you acquired an image</li>
</ul>
<p> In case you don’t have access to all of these information or if the information is simply not available you should include all details about a public domain image you have the access to. Furthermore, there are several styles of image citations that depend on the source from which an image was acquired.</p>
<p><strong>Conclusion</strong></p>
<p> Spending large sums of money on images you can use in commercial or private projects is not always necessary. The public domain images are widely available and they can be used in a broad range of contexts. Which website that lets you download public domain images do you like to use the most?

<p>The increase in popularity of Chromebooks, over the past several years is more than justified because these devices have proven that they are much more than just a web-browsing tool. Using a Chromebook for educational purposes or to widen your network of business associates is becoming more common, while new upgrades of the OS bring improvements at an astounding rate.</p>
<p>However, editing visual content isn’t that easy for Chromebook users, because Windows or Mac applications can’t be used that easily on these devices. That is the reason why online video editors play a large role for all Chromebook owners who want to create videos that meet at least some of the professional standards. Luckily, currently, there is a large number of online video editors available that can offer a solid video editing experience to users who would like to piece their video clips together into visually attractive content.</p>

<p>The increase in popularity of Chromebooks, over the past several years is more than justified because these devices have proven that they are much more than just a web-browsing tool. Using a Chromebook for educational purposes or to widen your network of business associates is becoming more common, while new upgrades of the OS bring improvements at an astounding rate.</p>
<p>However, editing visual content isn’t that easy for Chromebook users, because Windows or Mac applications can’t be used that easily on these devices. That is the reason why online video editors play a large role for all Chromebook owners who want to create videos that meet at least some of the professional standards. Luckily, currently, there is a large number of online video editors available that can offer a solid video editing experience to users who would like to piece their video clips together into visually attractive content.</p>

<p>When you’re taking a snapshot of someone or something and posting it to social media, you’ll need to decide if it’ll be a portrait or a landscape orientation. And that’s where the knowledge regarding the <strong>phone aspect ratio vertical</strong> comes in!</p>

<p>This post will dive into the rise of the phone aspect ratio vertical, including best practices on using <strong>phone ratio calculator</strong> and <strong>mobile vertical video size</strong> based on its final viewing platforms such as YouTube, Instagram, or broadcast.</p>

<h2 id="Part-1-Why-Vertical-Videos-Are-in-the-Frame"><a href="#Part-1-Why-Vertical-Videos-Are-in-the-Frame" class="headerlink" title="Part 1 Why Vertical Videos Are in the Frame?"></a>Part 1 Why Vertical Videos Are in the Frame?</h2><p>Did you know that there are six aspect ratios in total for videos and photos that marketers and creators use? These aspect ratios are 9:16, 16:9, 1:1, 4:3, 3:2, 21:9. The first way to choose the right aspect ratio for your video is whether the video needs to be vertical or horizontal.</p>
<p>A video that’s portrait or vertical mode is taller than it is wide. The entire screen is devoted to vertical video capturing while gaining attention.</p>
<p>Smartphones are to be held vertically, and although you can view media always horizontally, it’s far simpler for watchers to consume media while keeping their mobile phones upright.</p>
<p>Vertical videos are available in different sizes, but the most standard instances come in the 9:16 aspect ratio. While the traditional format of watching videos on phones has been horizontal with an aspect ratio of 16:9, vertical videos are taller than more comprehensive, hence the reversed aspect ratio. And, this is the main reason you see vertical videos in the frame, and thus, they need to be fixed or rightly shot in terms of ideal <strong>phone aspect ratio vertical</strong>.</p>
<h2 id="Part-2-Different-Aspect-Ratios-on-Mobile-Screens"><a href="#Part-2-Different-Aspect-Ratios-on-Mobile-Screens" class="headerlink" title="Part 2 Different Aspect Ratios on Mobile Screens"></a>Part 2 Different Aspect Ratios on Mobile Screens</h2><p>The aspect ratio also measures how tall or wide a display is. Still, it shouldn’t be mistaken for ‘display&#x2F;screen size’ calculated by diagonally measuring throughout the screen.</p>
<p>The <strong>phone aspect ratio vertical</strong> is commonly written in proportions with the more petite figure on the right side and the more prominent figure on the left-hand side. It’s also sometimes called a decimal, the more prominent figure divided by, the more petite figure.</p>
<p>It means that a display aspect ratio of 16:9 can also be called an aspect ratio of 1.78, i.e., 16&#x2F;9.</p>
<p><strong>Types of Aspect ratio</strong></p>
<p><strong>●</strong>   <strong>16:9 Aspect Ratio</strong></p>
<p>16:9 is one of the most common aspect ratios used on smartphones. Sometimes showcased as 1.78 or 4²:3², the aspect ratio has become typical for smartphones and other devices since 2010.</p>
<p>It generally means there will be 16 pixels in one direction for every 9 pixels in the other for a device with a 16:9 display.</p>
<p><img

                     src="/images/loading.svg"
                     data-src="https://images.wondershare.com/filmora/article-images/2021/best-practices-for-creating-phone-aspect-ratio-vertical-on-your-smartphone2.jpg"
                      alt="16:9 aspect ratio"
                ></p>
<p>Devices with a 16:9 aspect ratio are usually broad, and they became the standard aspect ratio for smartphones because most contents are also available in the exact format. So you would enjoy videos and gaming in full widescreen quality on a 16:9 aspect ratio device.</p>
<p>On the other hand, you’ll experience the “<strong>Letterboxing effect</strong>“ on devices that aren’t available in 16:9 aspect ratios and where black bars&#x2F;bands appear at the bottom and the top of the content you are wandering.</p>
<p><img  
                     lazyload
                     src="/images/loading.svg"
                     data-src="https://images.wondershare.com/filmora/article-images/2021/best-practices-for-creating-phone-aspect-ratio-vertical-on-your-smartphone3.jpg"
                      alt="letterbox image"
                ></p>
<p><strong>●</strong>   <strong>18:9 Aspect ratio</strong></p>
<p>This 18:9 aspect ratio was born out of the need to maximize the size of displays without increasing the dimensions of phone sizes.</p>
<p>The narrow design of 18:9 aspect ratio devices assisted for better one-hand grip, smooth multitasking, enhanced usability, and more screen real estate, etc. Yet, because contents are highly present in the 16:9 aspect ratio, there will be “black bands” at the top, bottom or to your display’s right or left.</p>
<p><img  
                     lazyload
                     src="/images/loading.svg"
                     data-src="https://images.wondershare.com/filmora/article-images/2021/best-practices-for-creating-phone-aspect-ratio-vertical-on-your-smartphone4.jpg"
                      alt="18:9 aspect ratio"
                ></p>
<p>The 18:9 aspect ratio allows for convenient usage of smartphones, provided we put the content-cropping and letterboxing aside.</p>
<p><strong>●</strong>   <strong>19:9 Aspect ratio</strong></p>
<p>19:9 is another smartphone aspect ratio that is becoming increasingly famous and used by top OEMs like Samsung, Huawei, ASUS, and Apple on their flagship devices.</p>
<p>The smartphones with a 19:9 aspect ratio are available with increased height and 19 pixels in single direction for every 9 pixels in the other. Similar to 18:9, devices with a 19:9 aspect ratio generally have pretty non-existent and slimmer bezels, but you’ll enjoy vast screen real estate with the latter.</p>
<p><strong>Understanding iPhone Vertical Video Dimensions</strong></p>
<p>Apple boasts a 16:9 screen for the versions of iPhone 5 onwards. Most Google&#x2F;Android phones already had a 16:9 screen at that point. Thus, to export a vertical video, you would want it to be 9:16. (16:9 standing up!) and it’s the ideal size for <strong>iPhone vertical video dimensions</strong>.</p>
<p>The highest quality vertical video’s output is 720 Horizontal by 1280 vertical for 1080p (1080X1920).</p>
<p>The highest quality vertical video’s output is 576 horizontal by 1024 vertical for 720p (720X1280).</p>
<p><strong>Vertical Phone Aspect Ratio for Video</strong></p>
<p>Let’s now understand the <strong>mobile vertical video size</strong>! Vertical video is pretty higher than it is wide. Instead of being shown in a landscape orientation or widescreen format, the way video has traditionally intended for television and cinema and television, and the vertical video rotated by 90 degrees.</p>
<p><img  
                     lazyload
                     src="/images/loading.svg"

                      alt="video aspect ratio"
                ></p>
<p>Hold your phone upright and record video in a 9:16 aspect ratio. Hence, the name vertical video is said to be!</p>
<p>It’s because if you horizontally hold your phone, the viewable screen area is 16:9 aspect ratio. The same standard is for most HDTV, video production, and cinema screen sizes.</p>
<h2 id="Part-3-Tips-to-Shoot-a-Vertical-Video"><a href="#Part-3-Tips-to-Shoot-a-Vertical-Video" class="headerlink" title="Part 3 Tips to Shoot a Vertical Video"></a>Part 3 Tips to Shoot a Vertical Video</h2><p>Besides using the <strong>photo ratio calculator</strong>, we’d like to enlist some tips on getting started with your <strong>phone aspect ratio vertical</strong> shooting.</p>
<p>1 – High production quality is not essential</p>
<p>Yes, the content is the king, and people or the end customers may not notice your video quality than the content. So, don’t be afraid when you start and move ahead with your DIY budget.</p>
<p>2 – Use the Ideal Dimensions</p>
<p>Whether it’s <strong>iPhone vertical video dimensions</strong> or other Android and Windows devices, you need to use the ideal dimensions already discussed above.</p>
<p>3 – Engage your audience better</p>
<p>You can incorporate little details within the video and engage your audience better. You can also add captions and burn them within the video.</p>
<p>4 – Optimize vertical videos</p>
<p>You can optimize vertical videos for viewing without sound. Try watching your videos without audio to see if they still make sense without that context. You likely won’t achieve the same excellent results made possible with good video marketing if they don’t.</p>

In this section, we will discuss a few helpful tips that will assist you in shooting a better vertical video in any condition you want to sort.</p>
<p>1 – Shoot in the desired or ideal aspect ratio</p>
<p>Any video bigger than the aspect ratio of 1:1 is vertical video.</p>
<p>It’s possible to create vertical videos two ways:</p>
<p><strong>●</strong> By framing a camera in portrait mode.</p>
<p><strong>●</strong> By rendering it vertically by scaling or cutting the video.</p>
<p>2 – Split the screen</p>
<p>You can use the tall height of the vertical frame to stack horizontal clips on top of each other creatively.</p>
<p>Clips can be related in appearance and content or appear to mend into one another. Various music videos have also used this technique.</p>
<p>You can also try merging various diagonal lines or clips for a unique look.</p>
<p>3 - Fill the vertical space</p>
<p>You can quickly fill vacant space in the frame automatically by getting closer to the subject.</p>

                ></p>
<p>4 - Try not to shake (or use a gimbal or a selfie stick)</p>
<p>While watching a video, jerking camera movements are almost always disturbing and distracting. This must be avoided quickly from side to side when creating vertical videos with minimized space on sides.</p>
<p>While a normal 360-degree or pan rotation is outstanding (and even crucial), cameras cannot manage the data amount they must process once they begin to move too quickly.</p>
<p>Slow down when in doubt!</p>

<p>5 - Remember to resize as per the platform</p>
<p>You don’t essentially have to shoot everything at eye level or arm’s length when you shoot videos vertically.</p>
<p>Changing your angles and shot length will assist make your videos more interactive, and you can create something compelling out of them within the video frame.</p>
<p>Screen recordings are usually horizontal, but they will be vertically viewed when you upload them to Instagram. They also make sure the edges did not get cut off while uploading them and the writing is still legible.</p>

<p>When you’re taking a snapshot of someone or something and posting it to social media, you’ll need to decide if it’ll be a portrait or a landscape orientation. And that’s where the knowledge regarding the <strong>phone aspect ratio vertical</strong> comes in!</p>

<h2 id="Part-1-Why-Vertical-Videos-Are-in-the-Frame-1"><a href="#Part-1-Why-Vertical-Videos-Are-in-the-Frame-1" class="headerlink" title="Part 1 Why Vertical Videos Are in the Frame?"></a>Part 1 Why Vertical Videos Are in the Frame?</h2><p>Did you know that there are six aspect ratios in total for videos and photos that marketers and creators use? These aspect ratios are 9:16, 16:9, 1:1, 4:3, 3:2, 21:9. The first way to choose the right aspect ratio for your video is whether the video needs to be vertical or horizontal.</p>
<p>A video that’s portrait or vertical mode is taller than it is wide. The entire screen is devoted to vertical video capturing while gaining attention.</p>
<p>Smartphones are to be held vertically, and although you can view media always horizontally, it’s far simpler for watchers to consume media while keeping their mobile phones upright.</p>
<p>Vertical videos are available in different sizes, but the most standard instances come in the 9:16 aspect ratio. While the traditional format of watching videos on phones has been horizontal with an aspect ratio of 16:9, vertical videos are taller than more comprehensive, hence the reversed aspect ratio. And, this is the main reason you see vertical videos in the frame, and thus, they need to be fixed or rightly shot in terms of ideal <strong>phone aspect ratio vertical</strong>.</p>
<h2 id="Part-2-Different-Aspect-Ratios-on-Mobile-Screens-1"><a href="#Part-2-Different-Aspect-Ratios-on-Mobile-Screens-1" class="headerlink" title="Part 2 Different Aspect Ratios on Mobile Screens"></a>Part 2 Different Aspect Ratios on Mobile Screens</h2><p>The aspect ratio also measures how tall or wide a display is. Still, it shouldn’t be mistaken for ‘display&#x2F;screen size’ calculated by diagonally measuring throughout the screen.</p>
<p>The <strong>phone aspect ratio vertical</strong> is commonly written in proportions with the more petite figure on the right side and the more prominent figure on the left-hand side. It’s also sometimes called a decimal, the more prominent figure divided by, the more petite figure.</p>
<p>It means that a display aspect ratio of 16:9 can also be called an aspect ratio of 1.78, i.e., 16&#x2F;9.</p>
<p><strong>Types of Aspect ratio</strong></p>
<p><strong>●</strong>   <strong>16:9 Aspect Ratio</strong></p>
<p>16:9 is one of the most common aspect ratios used on smartphones. Sometimes showcased as 1.78 or 4²:3², the aspect ratio has become typical for smartphones and other devices since 2010.</p>
<p>It generally means there will be 16 pixels in one direction for every 9 pixels in the other for a device with a 16:9 display.</p>
<p><img

                      alt="16:9 aspect ratio"
                ></p>
<p>Devices with a 16:9 aspect ratio are usually broad, and they became the standard aspect ratio for smartphones because most contents are also available in the exact format. So you would enjoy videos and gaming in full widescreen quality on a 16:9 aspect ratio device.</p>
<p>On the other hand, you’ll experience the “<strong>Letterboxing effect</strong>“ on devices that aren’t available in 16:9 aspect ratios and where black bars&#x2F;bands appear at the bottom and the top of the content you are wandering.</p>
<p><img

                      alt="letterbox image"
                ></p>
<p><strong>●</strong>   <strong>18:9 Aspect ratio</strong></p>
<p>This 18:9 aspect ratio was born out of the need to maximize the size of displays without increasing the dimensions of phone sizes.</p>
<p>The narrow design of 18:9 aspect ratio devices assisted for better one-hand grip, smooth multitasking, enhanced usability, and more screen real estate, etc. Yet, because contents are highly present in the 16:9 aspect ratio, there will be “black bands” at the top, bottom or to your display’s right or left.</p>
<p><img  
                     lazyload
                     src="/images/loading.svg"

                      alt="18:9 aspect ratio"
                ></p>
<p>The 18:9 aspect ratio allows for convenient usage of smartphones, provided we put the content-cropping and letterboxing aside.</p>
<p><strong>●</strong>   <strong>19:9 Aspect ratio</strong></p>
<p>19:9 is another smartphone aspect ratio that is becoming increasingly famous and used by top OEMs like Samsung, Huawei, ASUS, and Apple on their flagship devices.</p>
<p>The smartphones with a 19:9 aspect ratio are available with increased height and 19 pixels in single direction for every 9 pixels in the other. Similar to 18:9, devices with a 19:9 aspect ratio generally have pretty non-existent and slimmer bezels, but you’ll enjoy vast screen real estate with the latter.</p>
<p><strong>Understanding iPhone Vertical Video Dimensions</strong></p>
<p>Apple boasts a 16:9 screen for the versions of iPhone 5 onwards. Most Google&#x2F;Android phones already had a 16:9 screen at that point. Thus, to export a vertical video, you would want it to be 9:16. (16:9 standing up!) and it’s the ideal size for <strong>iPhone vertical video dimensions</strong>.</p>
<p>The highest quality vertical video’s output is 720 Horizontal by 1280 vertical for 1080p (1080X1920).</p>
<p>The highest quality vertical video’s output is 576 horizontal by 1024 vertical for 720p (720X1280).</p>
<p><strong>Vertical Phone Aspect Ratio for Video</strong></p>
<p>Let’s now understand the <strong>mobile vertical video size</strong>! Vertical video is pretty higher than it is wide. Instead of being shown in a landscape orientation or widescreen format, the way video has traditionally intended for television and cinema and television, and the vertical video rotated by 90 degrees.</p>

                      alt="video aspect ratio"
                ></p>
<p>Hold your phone upright and record video in a 9:16 aspect ratio. Hence, the name vertical video is said to be!</p>
<p>It’s because if you horizontally hold your phone, the viewable screen area is 16:9 aspect ratio. The same standard is for most HDTV, video production, and cinema screen sizes.</p>

<p>1 – High production quality is not essential</p>
<p>Yes, the content is the king, and people or the end customers may not notice your video quality than the content. So, don’t be afraid when you start and move ahead with your DIY budget.</p>
<p>2 – Use the Ideal Dimensions</p>
<p>Whether it’s <strong>iPhone vertical video dimensions</strong> or other Android and Windows devices, you need to use the ideal dimensions already discussed above.</p>
<p>3 – Engage your audience better</p>
<p>You can incorporate little details within the video and engage your audience better. You can also add captions and burn them within the video.</p>
<p>4 – Optimize vertical videos</p>
<p>You can optimize vertical videos for viewing without sound. Try watching your videos without audio to see if they still make sense without that context. You likely won’t achieve the same excellent results made possible with good video marketing if they don’t.</p>
<p>5 – Capture Attention</p>
<p>Yes, you need to attract the audience and capture their attention within seconds. And, it’s the only or one of the best tricks t get your audience hooked for the long term. Don’t underestimate the significance of storytelling, and you can thus add them for creative looks.</p>

In this section, we will discuss a few helpful tips that will assist you in shooting a better vertical video in any condition you want to sort.</p>
<p>1 – Shoot in the desired or ideal aspect ratio</p>
<p>Any video bigger than the aspect ratio of 1:1 is vertical video.</p>
<p>It’s possible to create vertical videos two ways:</p>
<p><strong>●</strong> By framing a camera in portrait mode.</p>
<p><strong>●</strong> By rendering it vertically by scaling or cutting the video.</p>
<p>2 – Split the screen</p>
<p>You can use the tall height of the vertical frame to stack horizontal clips on top of each other creatively.</p>
<p>Clips can be related in appearance and content or appear to mend into one another. Various music videos have also used this technique.</p>
<p>You can also try merging various diagonal lines or clips for a unique look.</p>
<p>3 - Fill the vertical space</p>
<p>You can quickly fill vacant space in the frame automatically by getting closer to the subject.</p>

<h2 id="Part-1-Why-Vertical-Videos-Are-in-the-Frame-2"><a href="#Part-1-Why-Vertical-Videos-Are-in-the-Frame-2" class="headerlink" title="Part 1 Why Vertical Videos Are in the Frame?"></a>Part 1 Why Vertical Videos Are in the Frame?</h2><p>Did you know that there are six aspect ratios in total for videos and photos that marketers and creators use? These aspect ratios are 9:16, 16:9, 1:1, 4:3, 3:2, 21:9. The first way to choose the right aspect ratio for your video is whether the video needs to be vertical or horizontal.</p>
<p>A video that’s portrait or vertical mode is taller than it is wide. The entire screen is devoted to vertical video capturing while gaining attention.</p>
<p>Smartphones are to be held vertically, and although you can view media always horizontally, it’s far simpler for watchers to consume media while keeping their mobile phones upright.</p>
<p>Vertical videos are available in different sizes, but the most standard instances come in the 9:16 aspect ratio. While the traditional format of watching videos on phones has been horizontal with an aspect ratio of 16:9, vertical videos are taller than more comprehensive, hence the reversed aspect ratio. And, this is the main reason you see vertical videos in the frame, and thus, they need to be fixed or rightly shot in terms of ideal <strong>phone aspect ratio vertical</strong>.</p>
<h2 id="Part-2-Different-Aspect-Ratios-on-Mobile-Screens-2"><a href="#Part-2-Different-Aspect-Ratios-on-Mobile-Screens-2" class="headerlink" title="Part 2 Different Aspect Ratios on Mobile Screens"></a>Part 2 Different Aspect Ratios on Mobile Screens</h2><p>The aspect ratio also measures how tall or wide a display is. Still, it shouldn’t be mistaken for ‘display&#x2F;screen size’ calculated by diagonally measuring throughout the screen.</p>
<p>The <strong>phone aspect ratio vertical</strong> is commonly written in proportions with the more petite figure on the right side and the more prominent figure on the left-hand side. It’s also sometimes called a decimal, the more prominent figure divided by, the more petite figure.</p>
<p>It means that a display aspect ratio of 16:9 can also be called an aspect ratio of 1.78, i.e., 16&#x2F;9.</p>
<p><strong>Types of Aspect ratio</strong></p>
<p><strong>●</strong>   <strong>16:9 Aspect Ratio</strong></p>
<p>16:9 is one of the most common aspect ratios used on smartphones. Sometimes showcased as 1.78 or 4²:3², the aspect ratio has become typical for smartphones and other devices since 2010.</p>
<p>It generally means there will be 16 pixels in one direction for every 9 pixels in the other for a device with a 16:9 display.</p>
<p><img  
                     lazyload
                     src="/images/loading.svg"

                      alt="16:9 aspect ratio"
                ></p>
<p>Devices with a 16:9 aspect ratio are usually broad, and they became the standard aspect ratio for smartphones because most contents are also available in the exact format. So you would enjoy videos and gaming in full widescreen quality on a 16:9 aspect ratio device.</p>
<p>On the other hand, you’ll experience the “<strong>Letterboxing effect</strong>“ on devices that aren’t available in 16:9 aspect ratios and where black bars&#x2F;bands appear at the bottom and the top of the content you are wandering.</p>
<p><img  
                     lazyload
                     src="/images/loading.svg"

                      alt="letterbox image"
                ></p>
<p><strong>●</strong>   <strong>18:9 Aspect ratio</strong></p>
<p>This 18:9 aspect ratio was born out of the need to maximize the size of displays without increasing the dimensions of phone sizes.</p>
<p>The narrow design of 18:9 aspect ratio devices assisted for better one-hand grip, smooth multitasking, enhanced usability, and more screen real estate, etc. Yet, because contents are highly present in the 16:9 aspect ratio, there will be “black bands” at the top, bottom or to your display’s right or left.</p>
<p><img  
                     lazyload
                     src="/images/loading.svg"
                     data-src="https://images.wondershare.com/filmora/article-images/2021/best-practices-for-creating-phone-aspect-ratio-vertical-on-your-smartphone4.jpg"
                      alt="18:9 aspect ratio"
                ></p>
<p>The 18:9 aspect ratio allows for convenient usage of smartphones, provided we put the content-cropping and letterboxing aside.</p>
<p><strong>●</strong>   <strong>19:9 Aspect ratio</strong></p>
<p>19:9 is another smartphone aspect ratio that is becoming increasingly famous and used by top OEMs like Samsung, Huawei, ASUS, and Apple on their flagship devices.</p>
<p>The smartphones with a 19:9 aspect ratio are available with increased height and 19 pixels in single direction for every 9 pixels in the other. Similar to 18:9, devices with a 19:9 aspect ratio generally have pretty non-existent and slimmer bezels, but you’ll enjoy vast screen real estate with the latter.</p>
<p><strong>Understanding iPhone Vertical Video Dimensions</strong></p>
<p>Apple boasts a 16:9 screen for the versions of iPhone 5 onwards. Most Google&#x2F;Android phones already had a 16:9 screen at that point. Thus, to export a vertical video, you would want it to be 9:16. (16:9 standing up!) and it’s the ideal size for <strong>iPhone vertical video dimensions</strong>.</p>
<p>The highest quality vertical video’s output is 720 Horizontal by 1280 vertical for 1080p (1080X1920).</p>
<p>The highest quality vertical video’s output is 576 horizontal by 1024 vertical for 720p (720X1280).</p>
<p><strong>Vertical Phone Aspect Ratio for Video</strong></p>
<p>Let’s now understand the <strong>mobile vertical video size</strong>! Vertical video is pretty higher than it is wide. Instead of being shown in a landscape orientation or widescreen format, the way video has traditionally intended for television and cinema and television, and the vertical video rotated by 90 degrees.</p>
<p><img  
                     lazyload
                     src="/images/loading.svg"

                      alt="video aspect ratio"
                ></p>
<p>Hold your phone upright and record video in a 9:16 aspect ratio. Hence, the name vertical video is said to be!</p>
<p>It’s because if you horizontally hold your phone, the viewable screen area is 16:9 aspect ratio. The same standard is for most HDTV, video production, and cinema screen sizes.</p>

<p>1 – High production quality is not essential</p>
<p>Yes, the content is the king, and people or the end customers may not notice your video quality than the content. So, don’t be afraid when you start and move ahead with your DIY budget.</p>
<p>2 – Use the Ideal Dimensions</p>
<p>Whether it’s <strong>iPhone vertical video dimensions</strong> or other Android and Windows devices, you need to use the ideal dimensions already discussed above.</p>
<p>3 – Engage your audience better</p>
<p>You can incorporate little details within the video and engage your audience better. You can also add captions and burn them within the video.</p>
<p>4 – Optimize vertical videos</p>
<p>You can optimize vertical videos for viewing without sound. Try watching your videos without audio to see if they still make sense without that context. You likely won’t achieve the same excellent results made possible with good video marketing if they don’t.</p>
<p>5 – Capture Attention</p>
<p>Yes, you need to attract the audience and capture their attention within seconds. And, it’s the only or one of the best tricks t get your audience hooked for the long term. Don’t underestimate the significance of storytelling, and you can thus add them for creative looks.</p>
<h2 id="Part-4-Top-6-Practices-for-Creating-Phone-Aspect-Ratio-Vertical-on-Your-Smartphone-2"><a href="#Part-4-Top-6-Practices-for-Creating-Phone-Aspect-Ratio-Vertical-on-Your-Smartphone-2" class="headerlink" title="Part 4 Top 6 Practices for Creating Phone Aspect Ratio Vertical on Your Smartphone"></a>Part 4 Top 6 Practices for Creating Phone Aspect Ratio Vertical on Your Smartphone</h2><p>Are you looking to capture the video in the correct <strong>phone aspect ratio vertical</strong>? In this section, we will discuss a few helpful tips that will assist you in shooting a better vertical video in any condition you want to sort.</p>
<p>1 – Shoot in the desired or ideal aspect ratio</p>
<p>Any video bigger than the aspect ratio of 1:1 is vertical video.</p>
<p>It’s possible to create vertical videos two ways:</p>
<p><strong>●</strong> By framing a camera in portrait mode.</p>
<p><strong>●</strong> By rendering it vertically by scaling or cutting the video.</p>
<p>2 – Split the screen</p>
<p>You can use the tall height of the vertical frame to stack horizontal clips on top of each other creatively.</p>
<p>Clips can be related in appearance and content or appear to mend into one another. Various music videos have also used this technique.</p>
<p>You can also try merging various diagonal lines or clips for a unique look.</p>
<p>3 - Fill the vertical space</p>
<p>You can quickly fill vacant space in the frame automatically by getting closer to the subject.</p>
<p><img  
                     lazyload
                     src="/images/loading.svg"
                     data-src="https://images.wondershare.com/filmora/article-images/2021/best-practices-for-creating-phone-aspect-ratio-vertical-on-your-smartphone7.jpg"
                      alt="fill vertical space"
                ></p>
<p>When the camera is angled down and raised high, you automatically get a deep frame for filming long shots that fill space.</p>
<p>The above-the-head perspective provides an attractive and latest POV that serves the exact purpose.</p>
<p><img  
                     lazyload
                     src="/images/loading.svg"
                     data-src="https://images.wondershare.com/filmora/article-images/2021/best-practices-for-creating-phone-aspect-ratio-vertical-on-your-smartphone8.jpg"
                      alt="image pov"
                ></p>
<p>4 - Try not to shake (or use a gimbal or a selfie stick)</p>
<p>While watching a video, jerking camera movements are almost always disturbing and distracting. This must be avoided quickly from side to side when creating vertical videos with minimized space on sides.</p>
<p>While a normal 360-degree or pan rotation is outstanding (and even crucial), cameras cannot manage the data amount they must process once they begin to move too quickly.</p>
<p>Slow down when in doubt!</p>
<p><img  
                     lazyload
                     src="/images/loading.svg"
                     data-src="https://images.wondershare.com/filmora/article-images/2021/best-practices-for-creating-phone-aspect-ratio-vertical-on-your-smartphone9.jpg"
                      alt="do not shake camera"
                ></p>
<p>5 - Remember to resize as per the platform</p>
<p>You don’t essentially have to shoot everything at eye level or arm’s length when you shoot videos vertically.</p>
<p>Changing your angles and shot length will assist make your videos more interactive, and you can create something compelling out of them within the video frame.</p>
<p>Screen recordings are usually horizontal, but they will be vertically viewed when you upload them to Instagram. They also make sure the edges did not get cut off while uploading them and the writing is still legible.</p>
<p>6 - Add graphics, fun text, GIFs, or stickers</p>
<p>Use text that complements visuals. Make sure your text isn’t highlighting your subject. Any graphics elements, such as stickers or emojis, should follow this exact approach.</p>
<p>Line them up where they’ll improve your video and scale them up as required.</p>

<h2 id="Part-1-Why-Vertical-Videos-Are-in-the-Frame-3"><a href="#Part-1-Why-Vertical-Videos-Are-in-the-Frame-3" class="headerlink" title="Part 1 Why Vertical Videos Are in the Frame?"></a>Part 1 Why Vertical Videos Are in the Frame?</h2><p>Did you know that there are six aspect ratios in total for videos and photos that marketers and creators use? These aspect ratios are 9:16, 16:9, 1:1, 4:3, 3:2, 21:9. The first way to choose the right aspect ratio for your video is whether the video needs to be vertical or horizontal.</p>
<p>A video that’s portrait or vertical mode is taller than it is wide. The entire screen is devoted to vertical video capturing while gaining attention.</p>
<p>Smartphones are to be held vertically, and although you can view media always horizontally, it’s far simpler for watchers to consume media while keeping their mobile phones upright.</p>
<p>Vertical videos are available in different sizes, but the most standard instances come in the 9:16 aspect ratio. While the traditional format of watching videos on phones has been horizontal with an aspect ratio of 16:9, vertical videos are taller than more comprehensive, hence the reversed aspect ratio. And, this is the main reason you see vertical videos in the frame, and thus, they need to be fixed or rightly shot in terms of ideal <strong>phone aspect ratio vertical</strong>.</p>
<h2 id="Part-2-Different-Aspect-Ratios-on-Mobile-Screens-3"><a href="#Part-2-Different-Aspect-Ratios-on-Mobile-Screens-3" class="headerlink" title="Part 2 Different Aspect Ratios on Mobile Screens"></a>Part 2 Different Aspect Ratios on Mobile Screens</h2><p>The aspect ratio also measures how tall or wide a display is. Still, it shouldn’t be mistaken for ‘display&#x2F;screen size’ calculated by diagonally measuring throughout the screen.</p>
<p>The <strong>phone aspect ratio vertical</strong> is commonly written in proportions with the more petite figure on the right side and the more prominent figure on the left-hand side. It’s also sometimes called a decimal, the more prominent figure divided by, the more petite figure.</p>
<p>It means that a display aspect ratio of 16:9 can also be called an aspect ratio of 1.78, i.e., 16&#x2F;9.</p>
<p><strong>Types of Aspect ratio</strong></p>
<p><strong>●</strong>   <strong>16:9 Aspect Ratio</strong></p>
<p>16:9 is one of the most common aspect ratios used on smartphones. Sometimes showcased as 1.78 or 4²:3², the aspect ratio has become typical for smartphones and other devices since 2010.</p>
<p>It generally means there will be 16 pixels in one direction for every 9 pixels in the other for a device with a 16:9 display.</p>
<p><img

                      alt="16:9 aspect ratio"
                ></p>
<p>Devices with a 16:9 aspect ratio are usually broad, and they became the standard aspect ratio for smartphones because most contents are also available in the exact format. So you would enjoy videos and gaming in full widescreen quality on a 16:9 aspect ratio device.</p>
<p>On the other hand, you’ll experience the “<strong>Letterboxing effect</strong>“ on devices that aren’t available in 16:9 aspect ratios and where black bars&#x2F;bands appear at the bottom and the top of the content you are wandering.</p>
<p><img  
                     lazyload
                     src="/images/loading.svg"

                      alt="letterbox image"
                ></p>
<p><strong>●</strong>   <strong>18:9 Aspect ratio</strong></p>
<p>This 18:9 aspect ratio was born out of the need to maximize the size of displays without increasing the dimensions of phone sizes.</p>
<p>The narrow design of 18:9 aspect ratio devices assisted for better one-hand grip, smooth multitasking, enhanced usability, and more screen real estate, etc. Yet, because contents are highly present in the 16:9 aspect ratio, there will be “black bands” at the top, bottom or to your display’s right or left.</p>
<p><img  
                     lazyload
                     src="/images/loading.svg"

                      alt="18:9 aspect ratio"
                ></p>
<p>The 18:9 aspect ratio allows for convenient usage of smartphones, provided we put the content-cropping and letterboxing aside.</p>
<p><strong>●</strong>   <strong>19:9 Aspect ratio</strong></p>
<p>19:9 is another smartphone aspect ratio that is becoming increasingly famous and used by top OEMs like Samsung, Huawei, ASUS, and Apple on their flagship devices.</p>
<p>The smartphones with a 19:9 aspect ratio are available with increased height and 19 pixels in single direction for every 9 pixels in the other. Similar to 18:9, devices with a 19:9 aspect ratio generally have pretty non-existent and slimmer bezels, but you’ll enjoy vast screen real estate with the latter.</p>
<p><strong>Understanding iPhone Vertical Video Dimensions</strong></p>
<p>Apple boasts a 16:9 screen for the versions of iPhone 5 onwards. Most Google&#x2F;Android phones already had a 16:9 screen at that point. Thus, to export a vertical video, you would want it to be 9:16. (16:9 standing up!) and it’s the ideal size for <strong>iPhone vertical video dimensions</strong>.</p>
<p>The highest quality vertical video’s output is 720 Horizontal by 1280 vertical for 1080p (1080X1920).</p>
<p>The highest quality vertical video’s output is 576 horizontal by 1024 vertical for 720p (720X1280).</p>
<p><strong>Vertical Phone Aspect Ratio for Video</strong></p>
<p>Let’s now understand the <strong>mobile vertical video size</strong>! Vertical video is pretty higher than it is wide. Instead of being shown in a landscape orientation or widescreen format, the way video has traditionally intended for television and cinema and television, and the vertical video rotated by 90 degrees.</p>
<p><img  
                     lazyload
                     src="/images/loading.svg"

                      alt="video aspect ratio"
                ></p>
<p>Hold your phone upright and record video in a 9:16 aspect ratio. Hence, the name vertical video is said to be!</p>
<p>It’s because if you horizontally hold your phone, the viewable screen area is 16:9 aspect ratio. The same standard is for most HDTV, video production, and cinema screen sizes.</p>

<p>1 – High production quality is not essential</p>
<p>Yes, the content is the king, and people or the end customers may not notice your video quality than the content. So, don’t be afraid when you start and move ahead with your DIY budget.</p>
<p>2 – Use the Ideal Dimensions</p>
<p>Whether it’s <strong>iPhone vertical video dimensions</strong> or other Android and Windows devices, you need to use the ideal dimensions already discussed above.</p>
<p>3 – Engage your audience better</p>
<p>You can incorporate little details within the video and engage your audience better. You can also add captions and burn them within the video.</p>
<p>4 – Optimize vertical videos</p>
<p>You can optimize vertical videos for viewing without sound. Try watching your videos without audio to see if they still make sense without that context. You likely won’t achieve the same excellent results made possible with good video marketing if they don’t.</p>
<p>5 – Capture Attention</p>
<p>Yes, you need to attract the audience and capture their attention within seconds. And, it’s the only or one of the best tricks t get your audience hooked for the long term. Don’t underestimate the significance of storytelling, and you can thus add them for creative looks.</p>
<h2 id="Part-4-Top-6-Practices-for-Creating-Phone-Aspect-Ratio-Vertical-on-Your-Smartphone-3"><a href="#Part-4-Top-6-Practices-for-Creating-Phone-Aspect-Ratio-Vertical-on-Your-Smartphone-3" class="headerlink" title="Part 4 Top 6 Practices for Creating Phone Aspect Ratio Vertical on Your Smartphone"></a>Part 4 Top 6 Practices for Creating Phone Aspect Ratio Vertical on Your Smartphone</h2><p>Are you looking to capture the video in the correct <strong>phone aspect ratio vertical</strong>? In this section, we will discuss a few helpful tips that will assist you in shooting a better vertical video in any condition you want to sort.</p>
<p>1 – Shoot in the desired or ideal aspect ratio</p>
<p>Any video bigger than the aspect ratio of 1:1 is vertical video.</p>
<p>It’s possible to create vertical videos two ways:</p>
<p><strong>●</strong> By framing a camera in portrait mode.</p>
<p><strong>●</strong> By rendering it vertically by scaling or cutting the video.</p>
<p>2 – Split the screen</p>
<p>You can use the tall height of the vertical frame to stack horizontal clips on top of each other creatively.</p>
<p>Clips can be related in appearance and content or appear to mend into one another. Various music videos have also used this technique.</p>
<p>You can also try merging various diagonal lines or clips for a unique look.</p>
<p>3 - Fill the vertical space</p>
<p>You can quickly fill vacant space in the frame automatically by getting closer to the subject.</p>
<p><img  
                     lazyload
                     src="/images/loading.svg"
                     data-src="https://images.wondershare.com/filmora/article-images/2021/best-practices-for-creating-phone-aspect-ratio-vertical-on-your-smartphone7.jpg"
                      alt="fill vertical space"
                ></p>
<p>When the camera is angled down and raised high, you automatically get a deep frame for filming long shots that fill space.</p>
<p>The above-the-head perspective provides an attractive and latest POV that serves the exact purpose.</p>
<p><img  
                     lazyload
                     src="/images/loading.svg"

                      alt="image pov"
                ></p>
<p>4 - Try not to shake (or use a gimbal or a selfie stick)</p>
<p>While watching a video, jerking camera movements are almost always disturbing and distracting. This must be avoided quickly from side to side when creating vertical videos with minimized space on sides.</p>
<p>While a normal 360-degree or pan rotation is outstanding (and even crucial), cameras cannot manage the data amount they must process once they begin to move too quickly.</p>
<p>Slow down when in doubt!</p>
<p><img  
                     lazyload
                     src="/images/loading.svg"

                      alt="do not shake camera"
                ></p>
<p>5 - Remember to resize as per the platform</p>
<p>You don’t essentially have to shoot everything at eye level or arm’s length when you shoot videos vertically.</p>
<p>Changing your angles and shot length will assist make your videos more interactive, and you can create something compelling out of them within the video frame.</p>
<p>Screen recordings are usually horizontal, but they will be vertically viewed when you upload them to Instagram. They also make sure the edges did not get cut off while uploading them and the writing is still legible.</p>
<p>6 - Add graphics, fun text, GIFs, or stickers</p>
<p>Use text that complements visuals. Make sure your text isn’t highlighting your subject. Any graphics elements, such as stickers or emojis, should follow this exact approach.</p>
<p>Line them up where they’ll improve your video and scale them up as required.</p>
