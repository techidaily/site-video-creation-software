<p>Did you know your Mac device comes with a built-in speech-to-text feature? So whether you use a laptop or desktop, you can generate text from your voice through your device’s microphone. Officially known as Dictation, the app allows you to transcribe text anywhere you can type it. So, for example, you can use Apple Dictation for your messaging and word processing apps.</p>
<p>The feature has been available since macOS Sierra as a free built-in feature. Earlier versions of Apple Dictation relied on its voice recognition software. However, it now relies on Siri for users of macOS Catalina onwards.</p>
<p>Typically, the app allows you to transcribe thirty seconds and below of audio. However, you can enable Enhanced dictation for longer transcription times. According to most users, the app is suitable for getting the first draft of your assignment, which you can manually edit later.</p>
<p>Follow these steps to enable Apple Dictation on your Mac:</p>
<ol>
<li>Tap the Apple logo on the top-left toolbar of your screen and select <strong>System Preferences</strong> from the resulting menu.</li>
<li>Click on the <strong>Keyboard</strong> option from the system preferences screen.</li>
<li>Once there, click on the <strong>Dictation</strong> option located at the top of the menu.</li>
<li>Select <strong>On</strong> to activate the app in its default mode. In addition, you can check the <strong>Use Enhanced Dictation</strong> box to enable additional functions such as offline use and text commands like bold and italics.</li>
<li>Finally, select your language from the dropdown menu and choose a shortcut key.</li>
</ol>
<p>Please note that you need to speak your punctuation loudly when using Apple Dictation. Otherwise, the app will consider them as regular words.</p>

                ></p>
<p>Another option to consider is speech-to-text Microsoft Word Mac. The app is free to use and relies on Microsoft Azure Speech Services to transcribe text. Below are the requirements to use speech-to-text word mac.</p>
<ul>
<li>An external microphone for your Mac desktop, or you can use your built-in microphone for your MacBook. This is because speech-to-text on Microsoft word mac only allows input with a microphone rather than an audio file upload.</li>
<li>An active Office 365 subscription. Please note you need to log in to your account for the app to function.</li>
<li>Insider builds 16.32 (19120802) and above.</li>
<li>An active internet connection.</li>
</ul>
<p>Once you have everything set up, follow these steps to use speech-to-text on Word.</p>
<ol>
<li>Launch Microsoft Word from your desktop.</li>
<li>Click on the <strong>Dictate</strong> button from the top menu of your Word document, and wait for the red dot to appear. The button features a microphone for easy identification.</li>
<li>Once the dot appears, start speaking to transcribe your text. Ensure you are in a quiet environment for the best results. In addition, speak louder when transcribing punctuations.</li>
<li>Click on the Dictate button to finish the transcription.</li>
</ol>

<p>Google Docs is arguably the market’s most accurate free speech-to-text service. In addition, it allows you to transcribe your voice to text and format documents with your voice. However, you can only use the service through the Chrome browser.</p>
<p>Follow these steps to activate Google Docs voice typing on your Mac device:</p>
<ol>
<li>Launch the <strong>Chrome</strong> browser on your macOS and select <strong>Docs</strong> from the app menu. Please note you will need an active Google account to use the service.</li>
<li>Open a new document and click on the <strong>Tools</strong> tab from the top menu.</li>
<li>Select <strong>Voice Typing</strong> from the menu to access speech-to-text on Google Docs.</li>
<li>Tap the microphone to start transcribing, and tap it again to finish.</li>
</ol>
<p>Google Docs speech-to-text is available in 71 languages. In addition, it supports simple commands such as ‘create a bulleted list,’ which are unavailable on other speech-to-text apps. As such, it is one of the market’s most popular voice typing apps.</p>

<p>Dragon Dictate is arguably the best dictation software currently on the market. According to most users, its accuracy and feature sets are next to none. For example, the Smart Format Rules learn how you represent dates, numbers, and abbreviations, resulting in less editing work for you. The Dragon Dictate app is free to download from the Apple Store.</p>
<p>Dragon for Mac users reports a dictation accuracy of nearly 99%, which is excellent in the speech-to-text software category. All of Nuance’s Dragon products use deep learning technology to capture your accent and cadence. As such, the app gets better at transcribing your text as you continue using it. In addition, dragon for Mac professional allows you to transcribe audio clips from uploaded files. For example, you can import audio from your iPhone to your Dragon Dictate workspace and transcribe it hassle-free.</p>
<p>Unfortunately, you cannot get a stand-alone dragon app for Mac. This is because Nuance discontinued its development in 2018. In addition, Microsoft’s acquisition of the company in 2021 proves that the decision is permanent. However, you can still use the Windows version of Dragon through Parallels, which allows you to run macOS and Windows simultaneously. In addition, this method also works for M1 Macs.</p>

Moreover, if an issue occurred in your version of Filmora, you cannot even report it and get technical assistance to fix it permanently.</p>
<h3 id="2-Illegal"><a href="#2-Illegal" class="headerlink" title="2.  Illegal"></a>2.  Illegal</h3><p>Using an application or software that you have not genuinely purchased is a crime everywhere. However, its punishment may vary depending on the countries or regions.</p>
<h3 id="3-Lack-of-Updates"><a href="#3-Lack-of-Updates" class="headerlink" title="3.  Lack of Updates"></a>3.

<h3 id="41-Lagging"><a href="#41-Lagging" class="headerlink" title="41.  Lagging"></a>41.  Lagging</h3><p>Downloading the Filmora X torrent means you’re getting a crack version, which can never match the integrity and speed of the actual version itself.

<h2 id="Part-1-Risks-of-Using-Illegal-Filmora-Torrent-You-Should-Know-3"><a href="#Part-1-Risks-of-Using-Illegal-Filmora-Torrent-You-Should-Know-3" class="headerlink" title="Part 1  Risks of Using Illegal Filmora Torrent You Should Know"></a>Part 1  Risks of Using Illegal Filmora Torrent You Should Know</h2><p>Well, there are some drawbacks and multiple threats that your PC will have to face when you download Wondershare Filmora Torrent. Some of the disadvantages and drawbacks are listed below.</p>
<h3 id="1-Lack-of-Assistance-3"><a href="#1-Lack-of-Assistance-3" class="headerlink" title="1.  Lack of Assistance"></a>1.  Lack of Assistance</h3><p>One of the significant setbacks of using illegal means to get Filmora is that you will not receive any technical assistance from the developer because you have not genuinely purchased the software. Moreover, if an issue occurred in your version of Filmora, you cannot even report it and get technical assistance to fix it permanently.</p>
<h3 id="2-Illegal-3"><a href="#2-Illegal-3" class="headerlink" title="2.  Illegal"></a>2.  Illegal</h3><p>Using an application or software that you have not genuinely purchased is a crime everywhere. However, its punishment may vary depending on the countries or regions.</p>
<h3 id="3-Lack-of-Updates-3"><a href="#3-Lack-of-Updates-3" class="headerlink" title="3.  Lack of Updates"></a>3.  Lack of Updates</h3><p>Getting Wondershare Filmora through Torrent will block all the communication with its server. Due to this, neither will you get the notifications about the updates, nor will you be able to update your application. In a nutshell, you will get stuck with the installed version of Filmora, which will get old with time.</p>
<h3 id="41-Lagging-3"><a href="#41-Lagging-3" class="headerlink" title="41.  Lagging"></a>41.  Lagging</h3><p>Downloading the Filmora X torrent means you’re getting a crack version, which can never match the integrity and speed of the actual version itself. Since the software’s code is modified not to need an activation key to unlock all the features, the software will experience lagging whenever you use it.</p>
<h3 id="3-Virus-3"><a href="#3-Virus-3" class="headerlink" title="3.  Virus"></a>3.  Virus</h3><p>Getting software through illegal means comes with many setbacks, and the virus is one of them. The modified copy of Filmora is not as secure as the original one. For cracking the software, they modify the .exe file, making it vulnerable to multiple threats and viruses that can harm your PC.</p>
<h2 id="Part-2-New-Features-of-Filmora-You-Should-Try-in-2022-3"><a href="#Part-2-New-Features-of-Filmora-You-Should-Try-in-2022-3" class="headerlink" title="Part 2  New Features of Filmora You Should Try in 2022"></a>Part 2  New Features of Filmora You Should Try in 2022</h2><p>You cannot simply neglect Wondershare Filmora when you are talking about software for video editing that comes with brand-new editing features. Filmora is among the top-rated video editing software. It comes with many helpful features for editing videos in multiple formats. Some of its notable features are:</p>
<h3 id="1-AI-Portrait-3"><a href="#1-AI-Portrait-3" class="headerlink" title="1.  AI Portrait"></a>1.  AI Portrait</h3><p>AI Portrait is one of the brand-new additions in Wondershare Filmora. It allows you to <a class="link"   target="_blank" rel="noopener" href="https://tools.techidaily.com/wondershare/filmora/download/" >remove the background of videos without using a Chroma key and green screen effect <i class="fa-regular fa-arrow-up-right-from-square fa-sm"></i></a>.
