<p>We all know that <a class="link"   target="_blank" rel="noopener" href="https://www.adobe.com/products/premiere.html" >Adobe Premiere Pro <i class="fa-regular fa-arrow-up-right-from-square fa-sm"></i></a> is one of the best professional video editing software, while to run such a powerful video editing software, you may need a powerful windows PC or Mac as well. Though most modern computer systems can run Adobe Premiere out of the box, there are some steps to take, and potential decisions to make, before installing the software, or if you are building or buying a new computer to make sure you get the best experience possible with the software.</p>

<ul>
<li>Intel 6th or newer <strong>CPU</strong></li>
<li>Windows 10 (64-bit) 1703 or later&#x2F; MacOS V10.12 later</li>
<li><strong>16GB RAM</strong>; 4GB GPU VRAM</li>
<li>Fast internal SSD</li>
<li>1920*1080 <strong>Display resolution</strong></li>
<li>32-bit <strong>video card</strong></li>
<li><strong>Internet connection</strong></li>
</ul>
<p>However, it is important to remember this is the minimum specification, and will not necessarily give a satisfactory user experience. The recommended specifications are far more likely to provide the kind of performance expected of the software and those would be the ones to use as a guide for the minimum spec for a new computer or any upgrades being planned prior to installation.</p>

<h2 id="How-to-check-Computer-Specifications"><a href="#How-to-check-Computer-Specifications" class="headerlink" title="How to check Computer Specifications"></a>How to check Computer Specifications</h2><p>Since Premiere Pro CC only works on Windows 10 system after 2018 13.0 release, we will show you how to check if your PC meets the requirements to run Premiere Pro on Windows 10</p>
<ul>
<li>Press <strong>Windows Key+ E</strong> on the keyboard to bring up <strong>Windows Explorer</strong>.</li>
<li>Right click the <strong>This PC</strong> option in the sidebar and then select <strong>Properties</strong> from the context menu.</li>
</ul>

<ul>
<li>The system specification window will show up which you see the <strong>Processor</strong>, RAM, system type and other system information.</li>
</ul>
<p>Checking the specification on your Mac is easy, just click the <strong>Apple icon</strong> in the top-left corner of your Mac, and then select <strong>About This Mac</strong> option. In the pop-up window you will see the information including Processor speed, memory and graphic card etc.</p>

Processor"></a>1. Processor</h4><p>Whilst the software will run on a Core2Duo intel or Phenom II AMD processor, it is worth noting that <a class="link"   target="_blank" rel="noopener" href="https://www.cgdirector.com/best-cpu-for-rendering/" >rendering can be highly intensive work for the processor <i class="fa-regular fa-arrow-up-right-from-square fa-sm"></i></a> and the fastest possible processor within your budget will pay dividends in speed of editing. In general, even a Core I3, the cheapest of the current Intel range, will be significantly faster than older processors, but because Premiere happily uses multi cored processors to their full, if the budget can reach to a quad core or more processor then do so, Premiere is a piece of software that benefits from the computational power increase more than most.</p>
<h4 id="2-Memory"><a href="#2-Memory" class="headerlink" title="2. Memory"></a>2. Memory</h4><p>The next consideration is memory. The minimum specification suggests 4GB of RAM with 8GB recommended, for reliable and smooth running consider 8GB minimum, and go for as much as you can. For a computer that is used for other activities as well, multitasking can see even 24GB of Ram being fully utilized, especially if you are working on HD content. Speaking of content, this is the other aspect of memory to look at. Whilst you can use a storage drive that contains everything else on your computer to keep the media you are working on, for HD content especially, and for trouble free and the fastest possible operation it is advisable to reserve a single drive, preferably a 7200 RPM or faster one, exclusively for your media. Bandwidth and access times means Premiere will be significantly faster in operation with its media on a dedicated drive.</p>
<h4 id="3-Graphic"><a href="#3-Graphic" class="headerlink" title="3. Graphic"></a>3. Graphic</h4><p>The final aspect of specification to consider is graphics. Adobe Premiere uses a feature called the Mercury Playback Engine that allows much faster and smoother playback of video without rendering, it has two modes, software only and <a class="link"   target="_blank" rel="noopener" href="https://www.techopedia.com/definition/32876/gpu-accelerated-computing" >GPU acceleration mode <i class="fa-regular fa-arrow-up-right-from-square fa-sm"></i></a> (Using either CUDA or OpenCL). The GPU acceleration mode offers significant performance increases and is therefore highly desirable. However, not all GPU’s are compatible with the Mercury Playback Engine, the list of those that are is found on the previously linked specification page, so if a new computer is being built or purchased, or upgrades are being considered prior to install, it is highly desirable to utilize a compatible GPU where possible.</p>
<h4 id="5-Settings"><a href="#5-Settings" class="headerlink" title="5. Settings"></a>5. Settings</h4><p>Having covered the basic specifications of a computer that will enhance the operation of Premiere, it is now time to look at the computer settings and how this can affect Premiere’s performance and usability.</p>
<p>The first thing to understand is that video editing, especially HD video, is bandwidth intensive, in effect, it fills up the lanes between the CPU, RAM, GPU and Hard Drive during operation. Spreading the use of that bandwidth over several devices can see huge performance gains, so one of the best ways to optimize the computer for Premier is to adjust how the hard drives are used. How effective this can be depends on the computer you are using, so we will try to cover a few different possibilities here.</p>
<h4 id="6-Drive"><a href="#6-Drive" class="headerlink" title="6. Drive"></a>6. Drive</h4><p>If your computer contains a single drive, simply install Premiere and start using it, there are no options available here. If there are two drives, keep one for the operating system, programs and cache files. Use the second drive exclusively for video project files, exported projects and previews.</p>
<p>If the computer has three drives then keep one for the operating system and programs, the second one for the video project files, and use the third for previews, cache files and exported projects.</p>
<p>If you have access to even more drives, then split the cache from the previews, and ultimately have one drive each for previews, exports and cache. Spreading the files across as many drives as possible enhances performance by enabling the different read&#x2F;write operations to occur without interference from each other.</p>
<p>That is the theory, but how do you achieve this? This is done within Premiere itself, there are two parts, accessing where the media cache files are placed is done though the edit menu, following the path edit &gt; preferences &gt; media.</p>
<p><img

                      alt="adobe premiere requirements" title="adobe premiere requirements"
                ></p>
<p>Changing where the project files, previews and exports are stored is just as easy, and is accessed via the project menu by taking the path project &gt; project settings &gt; scratchdisks.</p>
<p><img  
                     lazyload

                ></p>
<h4 id="7-Sequence-Setting"><a href="#7-Sequence-Setting" class="headerlink" title="7. Sequence Setting"></a>7. Sequence Setting</h4><p>When working with Premiere it is important to have the correct settings for the type of media you are using and the nature of the final output. This is done within Premiere by a function known as a Sequence.</p>
<p>After creating a new project you are presented with the sequence dialogue box. You can have as many sequences in a single project as you like, but Premiere always assumes you require at least one and so needs the first one to be created to allow work on a project. Any media, both audio and video, placed into a sequence is automatically adapted to the settings of that sequence, so you will want to choose settings that match the original media as closely as possible. Each sequence in a project can have different settings if required, as this lessens the workload on the CPU and makes the process faster and smoother.</p>
<p>The sequence dialogue has three tabs, Sequence Presets, Settings and Tracks</p>
<p>The Preset Tab makes setting up a new sequence much simpler. Choosing a preset enables Premiere to choose the settings that best match the chosen video and audio format. There are a wide range of presets available to suit the most commonly used media types, they are organized based on camera formats. Within each group there are numerous settings and configurations to choose from based around frame sizes and interlacing. Whilst choosing the correct preset can be a little daunting to the uninitiated, ensuring the number of frames per second, the frame size and codec are correct is all that is required.</p>
<p><img  
                     lazyload
                     src="/images/loading.svg"
                     data-src="https://images.wondershare.com/images/multimedia/video-editor/adobe-premiere-3.png"
                      alt="adobe premiere requirements" title="adobe premiere requirements"
                ></p>
<p>Once the preset is chosen you can move to the settings tab to adjust the preset manually. Some settings will not be adjustable in this tab due to the specific optimization required for the input media.</p>
<p>Because the presets do such a good job it is not really necessary to adjust anything in the settings tab, and unless you are trying to do something very specific.</p>
<p>While the standard presets are usually suitable, on occasion you may desire a custom setting. To do this, choose a sequence preset that is close to your media, and then make custom selections in the Settings tab. By selecting the Save Preset option on the Settings tab you can then create a custom setting with those parameters. Give the preset a suitable name in the Save Settings dialog and add any notes that are needed. The preset can be found in the Custom folder under Available Presets.</p>
<p>Those with the Apple Prores Codec on their computers can use this as the preview codec if required. By choosing Quicktime as the preview format in a custom editing mode, and lastly Apple Prores as the required codec.</p>
<h2 id="Conclusion"><a href="#Conclusion" class="headerlink" title="Conclusion"></a>Conclusion</h2><p>If your computer failed to meet the requirement to run Premiere Pro, you may need to spend some money to buy a powerful computer or choose another professional video editing software similar to Premiere Pro, or choose a video editing software. If your computer isn’t powerful enough to run Premiere Pro, you will get awful experience at editing footage because of the long loading time and stuck playback.</p>

Whilst you can use a storage drive that contains everything else on your computer to keep the media you are working on, for HD content especially, and for trouble free and the fastest possible operation it is advisable to reserve a single drive, preferably a 7200 RPM or faster one, exclusively for your media. Bandwidth and access times means Premiere will be significantly faster in operation with its media on a dedicated drive.</p>
<h4 id="3-Graphic-2"><a href="#3-Graphic-2" class="headerlink" title="3. Graphic"></a>3. Graphic</h4><p>The final aspect of specification to consider is graphics. Adobe Premiere uses a feature called the Mercury Playback Engine that allows much faster and smoother playback of video without rendering, it has two modes, software only and <a class="link"   target="_blank" rel="noopener" href="https://www.techopedia.com/definition/32876/gpu-accelerated-computing" >GPU acceleration mode <i class="fa-regular fa-arrow-up-right-from-square fa-sm"></i></a> (Using either CUDA or OpenCL). The GPU acceleration mode offers significant performance increases and is therefore highly desirable. However, not all GPU’s are compatible with the Mercury Playback Engine, the list of those that are is found on the previously linked specification page, so if a new computer is being built or purchased, or upgrades are being considered prior to install, it is highly desirable to utilize a compatible GPU where possible.</p>
<h4 id="5-Settings-2"><a href="#5-Settings-2" class="headerlink" title="5. Settings"></a>5. Settings</h4><p>Having covered the basic specifications of a computer that will enhance the operation of Premiere, it is now time to look at the computer settings and how this can affect Premiere’s performance and usability.</p>
<p>The first thing to understand is that video editing, especially HD video, is bandwidth intensive, in effect, it fills up the lanes between the CPU, RAM, GPU and Hard Drive during operation. Spreading the use of that bandwidth over several devices can see huge performance gains, so one of the best ways to optimize the computer for Premier is to adjust how the hard drives are used. How effective this can be depends on the computer you are using, so we will try to cover a few different possibilities here.</p>
<h4 id="6-Drive-2"><a href="#6-Drive-2" class="headerlink" title="6. Drive"></a>6. Drive</h4><p>If your computer contains a single drive, simply install Premiere and start using it, there are no options available here. If there are two drives, keep one for the operating system, programs and cache files. Use the second drive exclusively for video project files, exported projects and previews.</p>
<p>If the computer has three drives then keep one for the operating system and programs, the second one for the video project files, and use the third for previews, cache files and exported projects.</p>
<p>If you have access to even more drives, then split the cache from the previews, and ultimately have one drive each for previews, exports and cache. Spreading the files across as many drives as possible enhances performance by enabling the different read&#x2F;write operations to occur without interference from each other.</p>
<p>That is the theory, but how do you achieve this? This is done within Premiere itself, there are two parts, accessing where the media cache files are placed is done though the edit menu, following the path edit &gt; preferences &gt; media.</p>

                      alt="adobe premiere requirements" title="adobe premiere requirements"
                ></p>
<p>Changing where the project files, previews and exports are stored is just as easy, and is accessed via the project menu by taking the path project &gt; project settings &gt; scratchdisks.</p>
<p><img  
                     lazyload
                     src="/images/loading.svg"

                ></p>
<h4 id="7-Sequence-Setting-2"><a href="#7-Sequence-Setting-2" class="headerlink" title="7. Sequence Setting"></a>7. Sequence Setting</h4><p>When working with Premiere it is important to have the correct settings for the type of media you are using and the nature of the final output. This is done within Premiere by a function known as a Sequence.</p>
<p>After creating a new project you are presented with the sequence dialogue box. You can have as many sequences in a single project as you like, but Premiere always assumes you require at least one and so needs the first one to be created to allow work on a project. Any media, both audio and video, placed into a sequence is automatically adapted to the settings of that sequence, so you will want to choose settings that match the original media as closely as possible. Each sequence in a project can have different settings if required, as this lessens the workload on the CPU and makes the process faster and smoother.</p>
<p>The sequence dialogue has three tabs, Sequence Presets, Settings and Tracks</p>
<p>The Preset Tab makes setting up a new sequence much simpler. Choosing a preset enables Premiere to choose the settings that best match the chosen video and audio format. There are a wide range of presets available to suit the most commonly used media types, they are organized based on camera formats. Within each group there are numerous settings and configurations to choose from based around frame sizes and interlacing. Whilst choosing the correct preset can be a little daunting to the uninitiated, ensuring the number of frames per second, the frame size and codec are correct is all that is required.</p>
<p><img  
                     lazyload
                     src="/images/loading.svg"
                     data-src="https://images.wondershare.com/images/multimedia/video-editor/adobe-premiere-3.png"
                      alt="adobe premiere requirements" title="adobe premiere requirements"
                ></p>
<p>Once the preset is chosen you can move to the settings tab to adjust the preset manually. Some settings will not be adjustable in this tab due to the specific optimization required for the input media.</p>
<p>Because the presets do such a good job it is not really necessary to adjust anything in the settings tab, and unless you are trying to do something very specific.</p>
<p>While the standard presets are usually suitable, on occasion you may desire a custom setting. To do this, choose a sequence preset that is close to your media, and then make custom selections in the Settings tab. By selecting the Save Preset option on the Settings tab you can then create a custom setting with those parameters. Give the preset a suitable name in the Save Settings dialog and add any notes that are needed. The preset can be found in the Custom folder under Available Presets.</p>
<p>Those with the Apple Prores Codec on their computers can use this as the preview codec if required. By choosing Quicktime as the preview format in a custom editing mode, and lastly Apple Prores as the required codec.</p>
<h2 id="Conclusion-2"><a href="#Conclusion-2" class="headerlink" title="Conclusion"></a>Conclusion</h2><p>If your computer failed to meet the requirement to run Premiere Pro, you may need to spend some money to buy a powerful computer or choose another professional video editing software similar to Premiere Pro, or choose a video editing software. If your computer isn’t powerful enough to run Premiere Pro, you will get awful experience at editing footage because of the long loading time and stuck playback.</p>

Processor"></a>1. Processor</h4><p>Whilst the software will run on a Core2Duo intel or Phenom II AMD processor, it is worth noting that <a class="link"   target="_blank" rel="noopener" href="https://www.cgdirector.com/best-cpu-for-rendering/" >rendering can be highly intensive work for the processor <i class="fa-regular fa-arrow-up-right-from-square fa-sm"></i></a> and the fastest possible processor within your budget will pay dividends in speed of editing. In general, even a Core I3, the cheapest of the current Intel range, will be significantly faster than older processors, but because Premiere happily uses multi cored processors to their full, if the budget can reach to a quad core or more processor then do so, Premiere is a piece of software that benefits from the computational power increase more than most.</p>
<h4 id="2-Memory-3"><a href="#2-Memory-3" class="headerlink" title="2. Memory"></a>2. Memory</h4><p>The next consideration is memory. The minimum specification suggests 4GB of RAM with 8GB recommended, for reliable and smooth running consider 8GB minimum, and go for as much as you can.

<p>Figuring out which is the best security camera software is never easy. This is because most of the software you find online says it is free…until you download their software and it tries to charge you.</p>
<p>Here is a review of the best security camera software, and every single one has a free option. Share this article on social media if you find the right camera software for you.</p>
<p>But if you are new in this field, then you might want to know some basic technique terms introduced following, before we jump to choose the best security camera software.</p>
<h2 id="What-Is-an-IP-Camera"><a href="#What-Is-an-IP-Camera" class="headerlink" title="What Is an IP Camera?"></a>What Is an IP Camera?</h2><p>When people say, “IP camera,” they usually mean a camera that uses the Internet in some way so that it may do its job. A typical CCTV camera connects a camera to a computer via a wire. An IP camera can connect over the Internet.</p>
<p>Sometimes, the connection is remote. This means that the camera may be in one location and still be connected to another computer that is miles away.</p>
<p>However, many IP cameras are installed in a home and only travel a few feet&#x2F;meters to the nearest computer. In short, an IP camera doesn’t need a local recording device because the signal can be sent over the Internet or with a Wi-Fi connection.</p>
<h2 id="What-Is-Camera-Software-Used-for"><a href="#What-Is-Camera-Software-Used-for" class="headerlink" title="What Is Camera Software Used for?"></a>What Is Camera Software Used for?</h2><p>Most people and businesses use camera software to connect their cameras to their computers or their Smartphones. This is often cheaper than buying dedicated recording hardware. The camera and its software are usually used to monitor camera feeds that are life, and to records them onto a hard drive or to the Cloud.</p>
<h2 id="How-Do-You-Pick-the-Best-Security-Camera-Software"><a href="#How-Do-You-Pick-the-Best-Security-Camera-Software" class="headerlink" title="How Do You Pick the Best Security Camera Software?"></a>How Do You Pick the Best Security Camera Software?</h2><p>In most cases, the best software is simply the software that works with your cameras, and that offers all the functions you need. Compatibility is the first concern, but you also want it to work well with your device. For example, if your cameras have a zoom function, but your software doesn’t allow zooming, then that piece of software is not the best one for you.</p>
<p>For example, if you are using Linux, then you want Linux security camera software. And, some people insist that their software allows them to monitor their cameras from their Smartphones. The great thing about free security camera software is that you can test it out first without the risk of losing your money.</p>
<h2 id="If-You-Need-to-Edit-Your-Videos-Which-Is-the-Best-Video-Editor"><a href="#If-You-Need-to-Edit-Your-Videos-Which-Is-the-Best-Video-Editor" class="headerlink" title="If You Need to Edit Your Videos, Which Is the Best Video Editor?"></a>If You Need to <a class="link"   target="_blank" rel="noopener" href="https://tools.techidaily.com/wondershare/filmora/download/" >Edit Your Videos <i class="fa-regular fa-arrow-up-right-from-square fa-sm"></i></a>, Which Is the Best Video Editor?</h2><p>Exporting or downloading content from your camera software is a messy job. You often need a good video editor and trimmer to make your video clips usable.</p>
<p>This is especially true when video recordings can go on for as long as 90 days at a time. If you are looking for a high-quality and flexible video editor, then <a class="link"   target="_blank" rel="noopener" href="https://tools.techidaily.com/wondershare/filmora/download/" >Filmora <i class="fa-regular fa-arrow-up-right-from-square fa-sm"></i></a> is your only real and viable choice.

<h4 id="1-NetCam-Studio"><a href="#1-NetCam-Studio" class="headerlink" title="1. NetCam Studio"></a>1. <a class="link"   target="_blank" rel="noopener" href="https://www.netcamstudio.com/Pricing" >NetCam Studio <i class="fa-regular fa-arrow-up-right-from-square fa-sm"></i></a></h4><p><img

                      alt="best free security camera software"
                ></p>
<p>There is a free version of NetCam Studio, but if you want something more powerful, then you can buy one of their licenses. These licenses allow you to use the software for as long as you like, and they will update the software for up to two years after purchase.</p>
<p>After the two-year period, you can keep the software running as normal, but if you want upgrades, then you will have to buy them. Upgrades shouldn’t be needed unless you buy a new piece of camera hardware and it requires a new type of camera software.</p>
<p><strong>The NetCam Studio Features</strong></p>
<p>If you go for the free version of NetCam Studio, then you get to use a camera feed from two sources. There is a watermark added to the camera images, and you get five-day notifications. There is also community support.</p>
<p>The paid features include up to 64 sources, no watermarks, 250-day notifications, and you get priority support. After the 250 days is up, you may buy upgrades in order to keep the notification system going.</p>
<p><strong>Pros</strong></p>
<p>The free version does not expire in any way besides the notifications</p>
<p>You are able to use this software with a wide variety of camera brands</p>
<p>Updates are frequent enough to tackle most system-breaking bugs</p>
<p><strong>Cons</strong></p>
<p>The interface needs updating to make it more user friendly</p>
<p>They need to better explain the “Add Source” procedure</p>
<p>Troubleshooting audio problems is very difficult</p>
<h4 id="2-Security-Eye"><a href="#2-Security-Eye" class="headerlink" title="2. Security Eye"></a>2. <a class="link"   target="_blank" rel="noopener" href="https://www.security-eye-software.com/" >Security Eye <i class="fa-regular fa-arrow-up-right-from-square fa-sm"></i></a></h4><p><img

                      alt="best free security camera software"
                ></p>
<p>The reason Security Eye ranks so highly is that it is a professional piece of software that somebody decided should be free. It is not open source security camera software, but the developers have decided that it should be free. There used to be a free version where you would get 2 hours of free surveillance per day for free, but in 2019 the company removed its payment system. Will they keep it up or go back to paid subscriptions? Who knows, but you should get it while it is still free (if you can).</p>
<p><strong>Security Eye Features</strong></p>
<p>You can use a timer to determine when the video feed should start. You can capture images as JPEGs and then compress them. The system also allows you to receive alerts via a loudspeaker. It works with motion-detection devices too.</p>
<p><strong>Pros</strong></p>
<p>It comes with the Xvid MPEG-4 Codec</p>
<p>The full version has no nag screen or recording limit</p>
<p>The Security Eye interface is pretty modern for what is essentially a free piece of software</p>
<p><strong>Cons</strong></p>
<p>Demands 1GB of RAM and 2GB of HHD space</p>
<p>Requires at least an Intel Pentium 1.8 processor</p>
<p>The icons should be more intuitive</p>
<h4 id="3-Perfect-Surveillance"><a href="#3-Perfect-Surveillance" class="headerlink" title="3. Perfect Surveillance"></a>3. <a class="link"   target="_blank" rel="noopener" href="https://www.perfect-surveillance.com/" >Perfect Surveillance <i class="fa-regular fa-arrow-up-right-from-square fa-sm"></i></a></h4><p><img

                      alt="best free security camera software"
                ></p>
<p>There are three types of free security camera software for you to choose from. There is one for IP cameras, one for web cameras, and there is a piece of viewing software that people may use if they do not have something like VLC video viewer installed.</p>
<p><strong>Perfect Surveillance Features</strong></p>
<p>Simple icons and a clear interface is a great benefits. Determine when the cameras start monitoring and set up your own layouts to suit your viewing style.</p>
<p><strong>Pros</strong></p>
<p>A simple program that works in a very uncomplicated manner</p>
<p>Most of its icons are intuitive to where you can guess what they do</p>
<p>The Perfect Surveillance system has motion detection and allows you to monitor up to 64 devices</p>
<p><strong>Cons</strong></p>
<p>Installing seems overly long and bloated</p>
<p>There are not enough instructions on how to get your cameras connected</p>
<p>They do not explain how to capture and export screenshots</p>
<h4 id="4-iVideon"><a href="#4-iVideon" class="headerlink" title="4. iVideon"></a>4. <a class="link"   target="_blank" rel="noopener" href="https://www.ivideon.com/" >iVideon <i class="fa-regular fa-arrow-up-right-from-square fa-sm"></i></a></h4><p><img

                      alt="best free security camera software"
                ></p>
<p>There are times when a piece of free software simply does its job good enough to warrant no complaints, and that is exactly what iVideon offers. There are plenty of ways it can be improved, but there is nothing about it that demands harsh criticism.</p>
<p><strong>iVideon Features</strong></p>
<p>One of its most advertised features is facial recognition, but it is not very accurate. It does allow for very good mobile usage. You can view live and recorded footage on your desktop or mobile device. It is also available for Mac OS X and Linux.</p>
<p><strong>Pros</strong></p>
<p>Online home use and access is completely full-featured and freeware</p>
<p>It has smart notifications and has its own desktop and mobile apps</p>
<p>it doesn’t take long to learn how to use the iVideon interface</p>
<p><strong>Cons</strong></p>
<p>Seems rather light on features</p>
<p>Installing and connecting cameras requires a better tutorial</p>
<p>Embedding live video on your website is trickier than it first seems</p>
<h4 id="5-Xeoma"><a href="#5-Xeoma" class="headerlink" title="5. Xeoma"></a>5. <a class="link"   target="_blank" rel="noopener" href="https://felenasoft.com/xeoma/en/" >Xeoma <i class="fa-regular fa-arrow-up-right-from-square fa-sm"></i></a></h4><p><img

                      alt="best free security camera software"
                ></p>
<p>This program has plenty of features, but most of them are locked off to free users. It takes over too long to learn how to use the system, but it may be worth it if you have many cameras. The paid version has all sorts of perks from SMS texts to system health monitoring.</p>
<p><strong>Xeoma Features</strong></p>
<p>The lite version is the free version. It allows you to add four cameras with up to six modules in each chain. You can test out and use the lite version as long as you like, or you can get a free trial of the larger fully-featured program.</p>
<p><strong>Pros</strong></p>
<p>Record and monitor from four cameras</p>
<p>Updates are very frequent</p>
<p>This software works with mostly every type of camera</p>
<p><strong>Cons</strong></p>
<p>Around 90% of features are locked off to free users.</p>
<p>Xeoma is difficult to learn and set up</p>
<p>Connecting many cameras is difficult because the system is difficult to learn as a whole</p>

                      alt="best free security camera software"
                ></p>
<p>The Genius Vision system is a fairly advanced piece of software that is probably best used for businesses. If used at home, then there are many features that may never be used. It also works on mobile devices too.</p>
<p><strong>Genius Vision Features</strong></p>
<p>There are plenty of features to play with, including a massive array of settings to fit the many types of camera that this program can be used with. You can even support the company through Patreon and get more extensions on the program.</p>
<p><strong>Pros</strong></p>
<p>Works in-depth with many types of camera</p>
<p>The tools are very sophisticated and accurate</p>
<p>The drop-down menus are complicated while also being thoughtfully laid out</p>
<p><strong>Cons</strong></p>
<p>Getting paid upgrades is trickier than just buying on their website</p>
<p>Setting up the remote features is difficult</p>
<p>You have to figure out most of how to use the program based on which camera you have connected</p>
<h4 id="7-Deskshare-IP-Camera-Viewer"><a href="#7-Deskshare-IP-Camera-Viewer" class="headerlink" title="7. Deskshare IP Camera Viewer"></a>7. <a class="link"   target="_blank" rel="noopener" href="https://www.deskshare.com/ip-camera-viewer.aspx" >Deskshare IP Camera Viewer <i class="fa-regular fa-arrow-up-right-from-square fa-sm"></i></a></h4><p><img

                      alt="best free security camera software"
                ></p>
<p>The Deskshare IP Camera Viewer company has a great piece of security camera software that they repackage into many different names and then give away on their website. They do this because the software comes with lots of unwanted bloatware that the company is paid to promote. The sad part is that many other websites will replace this bloatware with Trojan viruses, which means it is difficult to get a clean version of this program.</p>
<p><strong>Deskshare IP Camera Viewer Features</strong></p>
<p>Live recording, playback, and split-screen is all available. You can use up to 4 cameras at a time, and it works with 2200 different camera models. If your hardware allows it, then you can pan, tilt and zoom your camera.</p>
<p><strong>Pros</strong></p>
<p>It is compatible with many types of camera brand</p>
<p>You can set up floating surveillance windows if you want</p>
<p>Adjust the properties of each camera individually</p>
<p><strong>Cons</strong></p>
<p>Installing is very difficult to do correctly</p>
<p>Comes with bloatware and&#x2F;or unwanted content</p>
<p>The IP software has the least features of all the Deskshare camera software</p>
<h4 id="8-Anycam"><a href="#8-Anycam" class="headerlink" title="8. Anycam"></a>8. <a class="link"   target="_blank" rel="noopener" href="https://anycam.io/" >Anycam <i class="fa-regular fa-arrow-up-right-from-square fa-sm"></i></a></h4><p><img

                      alt="best free security camera software"
                ></p>
<p>The Anycam system is a very average piece of software, but it works with most any type of camera. The interface is basic but easy to use and easy to set up. You will discover that the free version is only limited in terms of record time, you can still use all its features.</p>
<p><strong>Anycam Features</strong></p>
<p>Anycam is mostly featureless. It works with motion-detection cameras. It allows for video recording and playback. Plus, you can watch a live feed. Other than that, there is very little you can do with this basic-but-effective piece of software.</p>
<p><strong>Pros</strong></p>
<p>The program seems to work with any type of camera</p>
<p>Anycam has a paid version where you only make a one-time payment and get free lifetime updates</p>
<p>Installing and setup is very easy</p>
<p><strong>Cons</strong></p>
<p>Trying to find specific events on the timeline is very fiddly</p>
<p>The free version only allows two cameras to be linked</p>
<p>The recording is very limited with the free version</p>
<h4 id="9-ContaCam"><a href="#9-ContaCam" class="headerlink" title="9. ContaCam"></a>9. <a class="link"   target="_blank" rel="noopener" href="https://www.contaware.com/donationware-license.html" >ContaCam <i class="fa-regular fa-arrow-up-right-from-square fa-sm"></i></a></h4><p><img

                      alt="best free security camera software"
                ></p>
<p>In the strictest terms, this piece of software is not free. The developers ask you for a donation, but there is nothing forcing you to give them one. Plus, you can try the software, and then if it turns out to be brilliant, then you can always go back and donate to them.</p>
<p><strong>ContaCam Features</strong></p>
<p>Despite seeming very complicated, the interface is actually very self-explanatory. At first glance, it looks overly condensed and full of features, but each explains itself very well. You can configure the cameras very precisely to the point where you can even specify within which seconds it starts and stops.</p>
<p><strong>Pros</strong></p>
<p>A rather advanced piece of software</p>
<p>The interface layout is very condensed without being confusing</p>
<p>You can use web servers, the Internet, or intranet to receive live feeds</p>
<p><strong>Cons</strong></p>
<p>The interface has no aesthetic decoration at all</p>
<p>ContaCam takes a long time to learn through trial and error testing</p>
<p>The developers say this will never work with mobile devices</p>
<h4 id="10-Agent-DVR"><a href="#10-Agent-DVR" class="headerlink" title="10. Agent DVR"></a>10. <a class="link"   target="_blank" rel="noopener" href="https://www.softpedia.com/get/Security/Security-Related/Agent-DVR.shtml" >Agent DVR <i class="fa-regular fa-arrow-up-right-from-square fa-sm"></i></a></h4><p><img

                      alt="best free security camera software"
                ></p>
<p>The great thing about Agent DVR is that it is completely free because it is freeware. The sad part is that it was created by a developer who went on to finer things and left the program lodged on a few high-use servers. It is now being passed around freeware websites, which means it is sometimes difficult to find a clean version. Nevertheless, it is a fine piece of camera software that still works for many types of cameras.</p>
<p><strong>Agent DVR Features</strong></p>
<p>The Agent DVR software allows for video surveillance with a live feed, and for recording. You can use it with motion-detection software, and it still works for many different types of cameras. It uses a reliable SSL algorithm for its signal encryption, and it is very lightweight, which means it is not a big drain on your device’s CPU.</p>
<p><strong>Pros</strong></p>
<p>A very simple and lightweight piece of software</p>
<p>Works all the way back to Windows 7</p>
<p>It still works with motion detection systems</p>
<p><strong>Cons</strong></p>
<p>Agent DVR will become more obsolete as newer cameras appear over the coming years</p>
<p>Updates will never occur beyond Windows 10</p>
<p>The interface looks very dated compared to the modern camera software</p>
<h2 id="Conclusion-4"><a href="#Conclusion-4" class="headerlink" title="Conclusion"></a>Conclusion</h2><p>As you can tell by this article, getting good security camera software is difficult because there is so much to choose from. Plus, installing is often an issue, as is companies trying to nag-free users into paying. There is also the issue of connecting cameras and the problem with tagged-on viruses and bloatware.</p>
<p>Nevertheless, there is plenty to try without having to pay, so that is a positive. What do you think?</p>

<p>Figuring out which is the best security camera software is never easy. This is because most of the software you find online says it is free…until you download their software and it tries to charge you.</p>
<p>Here is a review of the best security camera software, and every single one has a free option. Share this article on social media if you find the right camera software for you.</p>
<p>But if you are new in this field, then you might want to know some basic technique terms introduced following, before we jump to choose the best security camera software.</p>
<h2 id="What-Is-an-IP-Camera-1"><a href="#What-Is-an-IP-Camera-1" class="headerlink" title="What Is an IP Camera?"></a>What Is an IP Camera?</h2><p>When people say, “IP camera,” they usually mean a camera that uses the Internet in some way so that it may do its job. A typical CCTV camera connects a camera to a computer via a wire. An IP camera can connect over the Internet.</p>
<p>Sometimes, the connection is remote. This means that the camera may be in one location and still be connected to another computer that is miles away.</p>
<p>However, many IP cameras are installed in a home and only travel a few feet&#x2F;meters to the nearest computer. In short, an IP camera doesn’t need a local recording device because the signal can be sent over the Internet or with a Wi-Fi connection.</p>
<h2 id="What-Is-Camera-Software-Used-for-1"><a href="#What-Is-Camera-Software-Used-for-1" class="headerlink" title="What Is Camera Software Used for?"></a>What Is Camera Software Used for?</h2><p>Most people and businesses use camera software to connect their cameras to their computers or their Smartphones. This is often cheaper than buying dedicated recording hardware. The camera and its software are usually used to monitor camera feeds that are life, and to records them onto a hard drive or to the Cloud.</p>
<h2 id="How-Do-You-Pick-the-Best-Security-Camera-Software-1"><a href="#How-Do-You-Pick-the-Best-Security-Camera-Software-1" class="headerlink" title="How Do You Pick the Best Security Camera Software?"></a>How Do You Pick the Best Security Camera Software?</h2><p>In most cases, the best software is simply the software that works with your cameras, and that offers all the functions you need. Compatibility is the first concern, but you also want it to work well with your device. For example, if your cameras have a zoom function, but your software doesn’t allow zooming, then that piece of software is not the best one for you.</p>
<p>For example, if you are using Linux, then you want Linux security camera software. And, some people insist that their software allows them to monitor their cameras from their Smartphones. The great thing about free security camera software is that you can test it out first without the risk of losing your money.</p>

You often need a good video editor and trimmer to make your video clips usable.</p>
<p>This is especially true when video recordings can go on for as long as 90 days at a time.

<h4 id="1-NetCam-Studio-1"><a href="#1-NetCam-Studio-1" class="headerlink" title="1. NetCam Studio"></a>1. <a class="link"   target="_blank" rel="noopener" href="https://www.netcamstudio.com/Pricing" >NetCam Studio <i class="fa-regular fa-arrow-up-right-from-square fa-sm"></i></a></h4><p><img

                      alt="best free security camera software"
                ></p>
<p>There is a free version of NetCam Studio, but if you want something more powerful, then you can buy one of their licenses. These licenses allow you to use the software for as long as you like, and they will update the software for up to two years after purchase.</p>
<p>After the two-year period, you can keep the software running as normal, but if you want upgrades, then you will have to buy them. Upgrades shouldn’t be needed unless you buy a new piece of camera hardware and it requires a new type of camera software.</p>
<p><strong>The NetCam Studio Features</strong></p>
<p>If you go for the free version of NetCam Studio, then you get to use a camera feed from two sources. There is a watermark added to the camera images, and you get five-day notifications. There is also community support.</p>
<p>The paid features include up to 64 sources, no watermarks, 250-day notifications, and you get priority support. After the 250 days is up, you may buy upgrades in order to keep the notification system going.</p>
<p><strong>Pros</strong></p>
<p>The free version does not expire in any way besides the notifications</p>
<p>You are able to use this software with a wide variety of camera brands</p>
<p>Updates are frequent enough to tackle most system-breaking bugs</p>
<p><strong>Cons</strong></p>
<p>The interface needs updating to make it more user friendly</p>
<p>They need to better explain the “Add Source” procedure</p>
<p>Troubleshooting audio problems is very difficult</p>
<h4 id="2-Security-Eye-1"><a href="#2-Security-Eye-1" class="headerlink" title="2. Security Eye"></a>2. <a class="link"   target="_blank" rel="noopener" href="https://www.security-eye-software.com/" >Security Eye <i class="fa-regular fa-arrow-up-right-from-square fa-sm"></i></a></h4><p><img

                      alt="best free security camera software"
                ></p>
<p>The reason Security Eye ranks so highly is that it is a professional piece of software that somebody decided should be free. It is not open source security camera software, but the developers have decided that it should be free. There used to be a free version where you would get 2 hours of free surveillance per day for free, but in 2019 the company removed its payment system. Will they keep it up or go back to paid subscriptions? Who knows, but you should get it while it is still free (if you can).</p>
<p><strong>Security Eye Features</strong></p>
<p>You can use a timer to determine when the video feed should start. You can capture images as JPEGs and then compress them. The system also allows you to receive alerts via a loudspeaker. It works with motion-detection devices too.</p>
<p><strong>Pros</strong></p>
<p>It comes with the Xvid MPEG-4 Codec</p>
<p>The full version has no nag screen or recording limit</p>
<p>The Security Eye interface is pretty modern for what is essentially a free piece of software</p>
<p><strong>Cons</strong></p>
<p>Demands 1GB of RAM and 2GB of HHD space</p>
<p>Requires at least an Intel Pentium 1.8 processor</p>
<p>The icons should be more intuitive</p>
<h4 id="3-Perfect-Surveillance-1"><a href="#3-Perfect-Surveillance-1" class="headerlink" title="3.

                ></p>
<p>There are three types of free security camera software for you to choose from. There is one for IP cameras, one for web cameras, and there is a piece of viewing software that people may use if they do not have something like VLC video viewer installed.</p>
<p><strong>Perfect Surveillance Features</strong></p>
<p>Simple icons and a clear interface is a great benefits. Determine when the cameras start monitoring and set up your own layouts to suit your viewing style.</p>
<p><strong>Pros</strong></p>
<p>A simple program that works in a very uncomplicated manner</p>
<p>Most of its icons are intuitive to where you can guess what they do</p>
<p>The Perfect Surveillance system has motion detection and allows you to monitor up to 64 devices</p>
<p><strong>Cons</strong></p>
<p>Installing seems overly long and bloated</p>
<p>There are not enough instructions on how to get your cameras connected</p>
<p>They do not explain how to capture and export screenshots</p>
<h4 id="4-iVideon-1"><a href="#4-iVideon-1" class="headerlink" title="4. iVideon"></a>4. <a class="link"   target="_blank" rel="noopener" href="https://www.ivideon.com/" >iVideon <i class="fa-regular fa-arrow-up-right-from-square fa-sm"></i></a></h4><p><img

                      alt="best free security camera software"
                ></p>
<p>There are times when a piece of free software simply does its job good enough to warrant no complaints, and that is exactly what iVideon offers. There are plenty of ways it can be improved, but there is nothing about it that demands harsh criticism.</p>
<p><strong>iVideon Features</strong></p>
<p>One of its most advertised features is facial recognition, but it is not very accurate. It does allow for very good mobile usage. You can view live and recorded footage on your desktop or mobile device. It is also available for Mac OS X and Linux.</p>
<p><strong>Pros</strong></p>
<p>Online home use and access is completely full-featured and freeware</p>
<p>It has smart notifications and has its own desktop and mobile apps</p>
<p>it doesn’t take long to learn how to use the iVideon interface</p>
<p><strong>Cons</strong></p>
<p>Seems rather light on features</p>
<p>Installing and connecting cameras requires a better tutorial</p>
<p>Embedding live video on your website is trickier than it first seems</p>

                      alt="best free security camera software"
                ></p>
<p>This program has plenty of features, but most of them are locked off to free users. It takes over too long to learn how to use the system, but it may be worth it if you have many cameras. The paid version has all sorts of perks from SMS texts to system health monitoring.</p>
<p><strong>Xeoma Features</strong></p>
<p>The lite version is the free version. It allows you to add four cameras with up to six modules in each chain. You can test out and use the lite version as long as you like, or you can get a free trial of the larger fully-featured program.</p>
<p><strong>Pros</strong></p>
<p>Record and monitor from four cameras</p>
<p>Updates are very frequent</p>
<p>This software works with mostly every type of camera</p>
<p><strong>Cons</strong></p>
<p>Around 90% of features are locked off to free users.</p>
<p>Xeoma is difficult to learn and set up</p>
<p>Connecting many cameras is difficult because the system is difficult to learn as a whole</p>

                      alt="best free security camera software"
                ></p>
<p>The Genius Vision system is a fairly advanced piece of software that is probably best used for businesses. If used at home, then there are many features that may never be used. It also works on mobile devices too.</p>
<p><strong>Genius Vision Features</strong></p>
<p>There are plenty of features to play with, including a massive array of settings to fit the many types of camera that this program can be used with. You can even support the company through Patreon and get more extensions on the program.</p>
<p><strong>Pros</strong></p>
<p>Works in-depth with many types of camera</p>
<p>The tools are very sophisticated and accurate</p>
<p>The drop-down menus are complicated while also being thoughtfully laid out</p>
<p><strong>Cons</strong></p>
<p>Getting paid upgrades is trickier than just buying on their website</p>
<p>Setting up the remote features is difficult</p>
<p>You have to figure out most of how to use the program based on which camera you have connected</p>
<h4 id="7-Deskshare-IP-Camera-Viewer-1"><a href="#7-Deskshare-IP-Camera-Viewer-1" class="headerlink" title="7. Deskshare IP Camera Viewer"></a>7. <a class="link"   target="_blank" rel="noopener" href="https://www.deskshare.com/ip-camera-viewer.aspx" >Deskshare IP Camera Viewer <i class="fa-regular fa-arrow-up-right-from-square fa-sm"></i></a></h4><p><img

                      alt="best free security camera software"
                ></p>
<p>The Deskshare IP Camera Viewer company has a great piece of security camera software that they repackage into many different names and then give away on their website. They do this because the software comes with lots of unwanted bloatware that the company is paid to promote. The sad part is that many other websites will replace this bloatware with Trojan viruses, which means it is difficult to get a clean version of this program.</p>
<p><strong>Deskshare IP Camera Viewer Features</strong></p>
<p>Live recording, playback, and split-screen is all available. You can use up to 4 cameras at a time, and it works with 2200 different camera models. If your hardware allows it, then you can pan, tilt and zoom your camera.</p>
<p><strong>Pros</strong></p>
<p>It is compatible with many types of camera brand</p>
<p>You can set up floating surveillance windows if you want</p>
<p>Adjust the properties of each camera individually</p>
<p><strong>Cons</strong></p>
<p>Installing is very difficult to do correctly</p>
<p>Comes with bloatware and&#x2F;or unwanted content</p>
<p>The IP software has the least features of all the Deskshare camera software</p>
<h4 id="8-Anycam-1"><a href="#8-Anycam-1" class="headerlink" title="8. Anycam"></a>8. <a class="link"   target="_blank" rel="noopener" href="https://anycam.io/" >Anycam <i class="fa-regular fa-arrow-up-right-from-square fa-sm"></i></a></h4><p><img

                      alt="best free security camera software"
                ></p>
<p>The Anycam system is a very average piece of software, but it works with most any type of camera. The interface is basic but easy to use and easy to set up. You will discover that the free version is only limited in terms of record time, you can still use all its features.</p>
<p><strong>Anycam Features</strong></p>
<p>Anycam is mostly featureless. It works with motion-detection cameras. It allows for video recording and playback. Plus, you can watch a live feed. Other than that, there is very little you can do with this basic-but-effective piece of software.</p>
<p><strong>Pros</strong></p>
<p>The program seems to work with any type of camera</p>
<p>Anycam has a paid version where you only make a one-time payment and get free lifetime updates</p>
<p>Installing and setup is very easy</p>
<p><strong>Cons</strong></p>
<p>Trying to find specific events on the timeline is very fiddly</p>
<p>The free version only allows two cameras to be linked</p>
<p>The recording is very limited with the free version</p>
<h4 id="9-ContaCam-1"><a href="#9-ContaCam-1" class="headerlink" title="9. ContaCam"></a>9. <a class="link"   target="_blank" rel="noopener" href="https://www.contaware.com/donationware-license.html" >ContaCam <i class="fa-regular fa-arrow-up-right-from-square fa-sm"></i></a></h4><p><img

                ></p>
<p>In the strictest terms, this piece of software is not free. The developers ask you for a donation, but there is nothing forcing you to give them one. Plus, you can try the software, and then if it turns out to be brilliant, then you can always go back and donate to them.</p>
<p><strong>ContaCam Features</strong></p>
<p>Despite seeming very complicated, the interface is actually very self-explanatory. At first glance, it looks overly condensed and full of features, but each explains itself very well. You can configure the cameras very precisely to the point where you can even specify within which seconds it starts and stops.</p>
<p><strong>Pros</strong></p>
<p>A rather advanced piece of software</p>
<p>The interface layout is very condensed without being confusing</p>
<p>You can use web servers, the Internet, or intranet to receive live feeds</p>
<p><strong>Cons</strong></p>
<p>The interface has no aesthetic decoration at all</p>
<p>ContaCam takes a long time to learn through trial and error testing</p>
<p>The developers say this will never work with mobile devices</p>
<h4 id="10-Agent-DVR-1"><a href="#10-Agent-DVR-1" class="headerlink" title="10.

                      alt="best free security camera software"
                ></p>
<p>The great thing about Agent DVR is that it is completely free because it is freeware. The sad part is that it was created by a developer who went on to finer things and left the program lodged on a few high-use servers. It is now being passed around freeware websites, which means it is sometimes difficult to find a clean version. Nevertheless, it is a fine piece of camera software that still works for many types of cameras.</p>
<p><strong>Agent DVR Features</strong></p>
<p>The Agent DVR software allows for video surveillance with a live feed, and for recording. You can use it with motion-detection software, and it still works for many different types of cameras. It uses a reliable SSL algorithm for its signal encryption, and it is very lightweight, which means it is not a big drain on your device’s CPU.</p>
<p><strong>Pros</strong></p>
<p>A very simple and lightweight piece of software</p>
<p>Works all the way back to Windows 7</p>
<p>It still works with motion detection systems</p>
<p><strong>Cons</strong></p>
<p>Agent DVR will become more obsolete as newer cameras appear over the coming years</p>
<p>Updates will never occur beyond Windows 10</p>
<p>The interface looks very dated compared to the modern camera software</p>
<h2 id="Conclusion-5"><a href="#Conclusion-5" class="headerlink" title="Conclusion"></a>Conclusion</h2><p>As you can tell by this article, getting good security camera software is difficult because there is so much to choose from. Plus, installing is often an issue, as is companies trying to nag-free users into paying. There is also the issue of connecting cameras and the problem with tagged-on viruses and bloatware.</p>
<p>Nevertheless, there is plenty to try without having to pay, so that is a positive. What do you think?</p>

<p>Figuring out which is the best security camera software is never easy. This is because most of the software you find online says it is free…until you download their software and it tries to charge you.</p>
<p>Here is a review of the best security camera software, and every single one has a free option. Share this article on social media if you find the right camera software for you.</p>
<p>But if you are new in this field, then you might want to know some basic technique terms introduced following, before we jump to choose the best security camera software.</p>
<h2 id="What-Is-an-IP-Camera-2"><a href="#What-Is-an-IP-Camera-2" class="headerlink" title="What Is an IP Camera?"></a>What Is an IP Camera?</h2><p>When people say, “IP camera,” they usually mean a camera that uses the Internet in some way so that it may do its job. A typical CCTV camera connects a camera to a computer via a wire. An IP camera can connect over the Internet.</p>
<p>Sometimes, the connection is remote. This means that the camera may be in one location and still be connected to another computer that is miles away.</p>
<p>However, many IP cameras are installed in a home and only travel a few feet&#x2F;meters to the nearest computer. In short, an IP camera doesn’t need a local recording device because the signal can be sent over the Internet or with a Wi-Fi connection.</p>
<h2 id="What-Is-Camera-Software-Used-for-2"><a href="#What-Is-Camera-Software-Used-for-2" class="headerlink" title="What Is Camera Software Used for?"></a>What Is Camera Software Used for?</h2><p>Most people and businesses use camera software to connect their cameras to their computers or their Smartphones. This is often cheaper than buying dedicated recording hardware. The camera and its software are usually used to monitor camera feeds that are life, and to records them onto a hard drive or to the Cloud.</p>
<h2 id="How-Do-You-Pick-the-Best-Security-Camera-Software-2"><a href="#How-Do-You-Pick-the-Best-Security-Camera-Software-2" class="headerlink" title="How Do You Pick the Best Security Camera Software?"></a>How Do You Pick the Best Security Camera Software?</h2><p>In most cases, the best software is simply the software that works with your cameras, and that offers all the functions you need. Compatibility is the first concern, but you also want it to work well with your device. For example, if your cameras have a zoom function, but your software doesn’t allow zooming, then that piece of software is not the best one for you.</p>
<p>For example, if you are using Linux, then you want Linux security camera software. And, some people insist that their software allows them to monitor their cameras from their Smartphones. The great thing about free security camera software is that you can test it out first without the risk of losing your money.</p>

<h4 id="1-NetCam-Studio-2"><a href="#1-NetCam-Studio-2" class="headerlink" title="1. NetCam Studio"></a>1. <a class="link"   target="_blank" rel="noopener" href="https://www.netcamstudio.com/Pricing" >NetCam Studio <i class="fa-regular fa-arrow-up-right-from-square fa-sm"></i></a></h4><p><img

                      alt="best free security camera software"
                ></p>
<p>There is a free version of NetCam Studio, but if you want something more powerful, then you can buy one of their licenses. These licenses allow you to use the software for as long as you like, and they will update the software for up to two years after purchase.</p>
<p>After the two-year period, you can keep the software running as normal, but if you want upgrades, then you will have to buy them. Upgrades shouldn’t be needed unless you buy a new piece of camera hardware and it requires a new type of camera software.</p>
<p><strong>The NetCam Studio Features</strong></p>
<p>If you go for the free version of NetCam Studio, then you get to use a camera feed from two sources. There is a watermark added to the camera images, and you get five-day notifications. There is also community support.</p>
<p>The paid features include up to 64 sources, no watermarks, 250-day notifications, and you get priority support. After the 250 days is up, you may buy upgrades in order to keep the notification system going.</p>
<p><strong>Pros</strong></p>
<p>The free version does not expire in any way besides the notifications</p>
<p>You are able to use this software with a wide variety of camera brands</p>
<p>Updates are frequent enough to tackle most system-breaking bugs</p>
<p><strong>Cons</strong></p>
<p>The interface needs updating to make it more user friendly</p>
<p>They need to better explain the “Add Source” procedure</p>
<p>Troubleshooting audio problems is very difficult</p>
<h4 id="2-Security-Eye-2"><a href="#2-Security-Eye-2" class="headerlink" title="2. Security Eye"></a>2. <a class="link"   target="_blank" rel="noopener" href="https://www.security-eye-software.com/" >Security Eye <i class="fa-regular fa-arrow-up-right-from-square fa-sm"></i></a></h4><p><img

                      alt="best free security camera software"
                ></p>
<p>The reason Security Eye ranks so highly is that it is a professional piece of software that somebody decided should be free. It is not open source security camera software, but the developers have decided that it should be free. There used to be a free version where you would get 2 hours of free surveillance per day for free, but in 2019 the company removed its payment system. Will they keep it up or go back to paid subscriptions? Who knows, but you should get it while it is still free (if you can).</p>
<p><strong>Security Eye Features</strong></p>
<p>You can use a timer to determine when the video feed should start. You can capture images as JPEGs and then compress them. The system also allows you to receive alerts via a loudspeaker. It works with motion-detection devices too.</p>
<p><strong>Pros</strong></p>
<p>It comes with the Xvid MPEG-4 Codec</p>
<p>The full version has no nag screen or recording limit</p>
<p>The Security Eye interface is pretty modern for what is essentially a free piece of software</p>
<p><strong>Cons</strong></p>
<p>Demands 1GB of RAM and 2GB of HHD space</p>
<p>Requires at least an Intel Pentium 1.8 processor</p>
<p>The icons should be more intuitive</p>
<h4 id="3-Perfect-Surveillance-2"><a href="#3-Perfect-Surveillance-2" class="headerlink" title="3. Perfect Surveillance"></a>3. <a class="link"   target="_blank" rel="noopener" href="https://www.perfect-surveillance.com/" >Perfect Surveillance <i class="fa-regular fa-arrow-up-right-from-square fa-sm"></i></a></h4><p><img

                      alt="best free security camera software"
                ></p>
<p>There are three types of free security camera software for you to choose from. There is one for IP cameras, one for web cameras, and there is a piece of viewing software that people may use if they do not have something like VLC video viewer installed.</p>
<p><strong>Perfect Surveillance Features</strong></p>
<p>Simple icons and a clear interface is a great benefits. Determine when the cameras start monitoring and set up your own layouts to suit your viewing style.</p>
<p><strong>Pros</strong></p>
<p>A simple program that works in a very uncomplicated manner</p>
<p>Most of its icons are intuitive to where you can guess what they do</p>
<p>The Perfect Surveillance system has motion detection and allows you to monitor up to 64 devices</p>
<p><strong>Cons</strong></p>
<p>Installing seems overly long and bloated</p>
<p>There are not enough instructions on how to get your cameras connected</p>
<p>They do not explain how to capture and export screenshots</p>
<h4 id="4-iVideon-2"><a href="#4-iVideon-2" class="headerlink" title="4. iVideon"></a>4. <a class="link"   target="_blank" rel="noopener" href="https://www.ivideon.com/" >iVideon <i class="fa-regular fa-arrow-up-right-from-square fa-sm"></i></a></h4><p><img

                      alt="best free security camera software"
                ></p>
<p>There are times when a piece of free software simply does its job good enough to warrant no complaints, and that is exactly what iVideon offers. There are plenty of ways it can be improved, but there is nothing about it that demands harsh criticism.</p>
<p><strong>iVideon Features</strong></p>
<p>One of its most advertised features is facial recognition, but it is not very accurate. It does allow for very good mobile usage. You can view live and recorded footage on your desktop or mobile device. It is also available for Mac OS X and Linux.</p>
<p><strong>Pros</strong></p>
<p>Online home use and access is completely full-featured and freeware</p>
<p>It has smart notifications and has its own desktop and mobile apps</p>
<p>it doesn’t take long to learn how to use the iVideon interface</p>
<p><strong>Cons</strong></p>
<p>Seems rather light on features</p>
<p>Installing and connecting cameras requires a better tutorial</p>
<p>Embedding live video on your website is trickier than it first seems</p>

                      alt="best free security camera software"
                ></p>
<p>This program has plenty of features, but most of them are locked off to free users. It takes over too long to learn how to use the system, but it may be worth it if you have many cameras. The paid version has all sorts of perks from SMS texts to system health monitoring.</p>
<p><strong>Xeoma Features</strong></p>
<p>The lite version is the free version. It allows you to add four cameras with up to six modules in each chain. You can test out and use the lite version as long as you like, or you can get a free trial of the larger fully-featured program.</p>
<p><strong>Pros</strong></p>
<p>Record and monitor from four cameras</p>
<p>Updates are very frequent</p>
<p>This software works with mostly every type of camera</p>
<p><strong>Cons</strong></p>
<p>Around 90% of features are locked off to free users.</p>
<p>Xeoma is difficult to learn and set up</p>
<p>Connecting many cameras is difficult because the system is difficult to learn as a whole</p>

                      alt="best free security camera software"
                ></p>
<p>The Genius Vision system is a fairly advanced piece of software that is probably best used for businesses. If used at home, then there are many features that may never be used. It also works on mobile devices too.</p>
<p><strong>Genius Vision Features</strong></p>
<p>There are plenty of features to play with, including a massive array of settings to fit the many types of camera that this program can be used with. You can even support the company through Patreon and get more extensions on the program.</p>
<p><strong>Pros</strong></p>
<p>Works in-depth with many types of camera</p>
<p>The tools are very sophisticated and accurate</p>
<p>The drop-down menus are complicated while also being thoughtfully laid out</p>
<p><strong>Cons</strong></p>
<p>Getting paid upgrades is trickier than just buying on their website</p>
<p>Setting up the remote features is difficult</p>
<p>You have to figure out most of how to use the program based on which camera you have connected</p>
<h4 id="7-Deskshare-IP-Camera-Viewer-2"><a href="#7-Deskshare-IP-Camera-Viewer-2" class="headerlink" title="7. Deskshare IP Camera Viewer"></a>7. <a class="link"   target="_blank" rel="noopener" href="https://www.deskshare.com/ip-camera-viewer.aspx" >Deskshare IP Camera Viewer <i class="fa-regular fa-arrow-up-right-from-square fa-sm"></i></a></h4><p><img

                      alt="best free security camera software"
                ></p>
<p>The Deskshare IP Camera Viewer company has a great piece of security camera software that they repackage into many different names and then give away on their website. They do this because the software comes with lots of unwanted bloatware that the company is paid to promote. The sad part is that many other websites will replace this bloatware with Trojan viruses, which means it is difficult to get a clean version of this program.</p>
<p><strong>Deskshare IP Camera Viewer Features</strong></p>
<p>Live recording, playback, and split-screen is all available. You can use up to 4 cameras at a time, and it works with 2200 different camera models. If your hardware allows it, then you can pan, tilt and zoom your camera.</p>
<p><strong>Pros</strong></p>
<p>It is compatible with many types of camera brand</p>
<p>You can set up floating surveillance windows if you want</p>
<p>Adjust the properties of each camera individually</p>
<p><strong>Cons</strong></p>
<p>Installing is very difficult to do correctly</p>
<p>Comes with bloatware and&#x2F;or unwanted content</p>
<p>The IP software has the least features of all the Deskshare camera software</p>
<h4 id="8-Anycam-2"><a href="#8-Anycam-2" class="headerlink" title="8. Anycam"></a>8. <a class="link"   target="_blank" rel="noopener" href="https://anycam.io/" >Anycam <i class="fa-regular fa-arrow-up-right-from-square fa-sm"></i></a></h4><p><img

                      alt="best free security camera software"
                ></p>
<p>The Anycam system is a very average piece of software, but it works with most any type of camera. The interface is basic but easy to use and easy to set up. You will discover that the free version is only limited in terms of record time, you can still use all its features.</p>
<p><strong>Anycam Features</strong></p>
<p>Anycam is mostly featureless. It works with motion-detection cameras. It allows for video recording and playback. Plus, you can watch a live feed. Other than that, there is very little you can do with this basic-but-effective piece of software.</p>
<p><strong>Pros</strong></p>
<p>The program seems to work with any type of camera</p>
<p>Anycam has a paid version where you only make a one-time payment and get free lifetime updates</p>
<p>Installing and setup is very easy</p>
<p><strong>Cons</strong></p>
<p>Trying to find specific events on the timeline is very fiddly</p>
<p>The free version only allows two cameras to be linked</p>
<p>The recording is very limited with the free version</p>
<h4 id="9-ContaCam-2"><a href="#9-ContaCam-2" class="headerlink" title="9. ContaCam"></a>9. <a class="link"   target="_blank" rel="noopener" href="https://www.contaware.com/donationware-license.html" >ContaCam <i class="fa-regular fa-arrow-up-right-from-square fa-sm"></i></a></h4><p><img

                      alt="best free security camera software"
                ></p>
<p>In the strictest terms, this piece of software is not free. The developers ask you for a donation, but there is nothing forcing you to give them one. Plus, you can try the software, and then if it turns out to be brilliant, then you can always go back and donate to them.</p>
<p><strong>ContaCam Features</strong></p>
<p>Despite seeming very complicated, the interface is actually very self-explanatory. At first glance, it looks overly condensed and full of features, but each explains itself very well. You can configure the cameras very precisely to the point where you can even specify within which seconds it starts and stops.</p>
<p><strong>Pros</strong></p>
<p>A rather advanced piece of software</p>
<p>The interface layout is very condensed without being confusing</p>
<p>You can use web servers, the Internet, or intranet to receive live feeds</p>
<p><strong>Cons</strong></p>
<p>The interface has no aesthetic decoration at all</p>
<p>ContaCam takes a long time to learn through trial and error testing</p>
<p>The developers say this will never work with mobile devices</p>
<h4 id="10-Agent-DVR-2"><a href="#10-Agent-DVR-2" class="headerlink" title="10.

                      alt="best free security camera software"
                ></p>
<p>The great thing about Agent DVR is that it is completely free because it is freeware. The sad part is that it was created by a developer who went on to finer things and left the program lodged on a few high-use servers. It is now being passed around freeware websites, which means it is sometimes difficult to find a clean version. Nevertheless, it is a fine piece of camera software that still works for many types of cameras.</p>
<p><strong>Agent DVR Features</strong></p>
<p>The Agent DVR software allows for video surveillance with a live feed, and for recording. You can use it with motion-detection software, and it still works for many different types of cameras. It uses a reliable SSL algorithm for its signal encryption, and it is very lightweight, which means it is not a big drain on your device’s CPU.</p>
<p><strong>Pros</strong></p>
<p>A very simple and lightweight piece of software</p>
<p>Works all the way back to Windows 7</p>
<p>It still works with motion detection systems</p>
<p><strong>Cons</strong></p>
<p>Agent DVR will become more obsolete as newer cameras appear over the coming years</p>
<p>Updates will never occur beyond Windows 10</p>
<p>The interface looks very dated compared to the modern camera software</p>
<h2 id="Conclusion-6"><a href="#Conclusion-6" class="headerlink" title="Conclusion"></a>Conclusion</h2><p>As you can tell by this article, getting good security camera software is difficult because there is so much to choose from. Plus, installing is often an issue, as is companies trying to nag-free users into paying. There is also the issue of connecting cameras and the problem with tagged-on viruses and bloatware.</p>
<p>Nevertheless, there is plenty to try without having to pay, so that is a positive. What do you think?</p>

<p>Figuring out which is the best security camera software is never easy. This is because most of the software you find online says it is free…until you download their software and it tries to charge you.</p>
<p>Here is a review of the best security camera software, and every single one has a free option. Share this article on social media if you find the right camera software for you.</p>
<p>But if you are new in this field, then you might want to know some basic technique terms introduced following, before we jump to choose the best security camera software.</p>
<h2 id="What-Is-an-IP-Camera-3"><a href="#What-Is-an-IP-Camera-3" class="headerlink" title="What Is an IP Camera?"></a>What Is an IP Camera?</h2><p>When people say, “IP camera,” they usually mean a camera that uses the Internet in some way so that it may do its job. A typical CCTV camera connects a camera to a computer via a wire. An IP camera can connect over the Internet.</p>
<p>Sometimes, the connection is remote. This means that the camera may be in one location and still be connected to another computer that is miles away.</p>
<p>However, many IP cameras are installed in a home and only travel a few feet&#x2F;meters to the nearest computer. In short, an IP camera doesn’t need a local recording device because the signal can be sent over the Internet or with a Wi-Fi connection.</p>
<h2 id="What-Is-Camera-Software-Used-for-3"><a href="#What-Is-Camera-Software-Used-for-3" class="headerlink" title="What Is Camera Software Used for?"></a>What Is Camera Software Used for?</h2><p>Most people and businesses use camera software to connect their cameras to their computers or their Smartphones. This is often cheaper than buying dedicated recording hardware. The camera and its software are usually used to monitor camera feeds that are life, and to records them onto a hard drive or to the Cloud.</p>
<h2 id="How-Do-You-Pick-the-Best-Security-Camera-Software-3"><a href="#How-Do-You-Pick-the-Best-Security-Camera-Software-3" class="headerlink" title="How Do You Pick the Best Security Camera Software?"></a>How Do You Pick the Best Security Camera Software?</h2><p>In most cases, the best software is simply the software that works with your cameras, and that offers all the functions you need. Compatibility is the first concern, but you also want it to work well with your device. For example, if your cameras have a zoom function, but your software doesn’t allow zooming, then that piece of software is not the best one for you.</p>
<p>For example, if you are using Linux, then you want Linux security camera software. And, some people insist that their software allows them to monitor their cameras from their Smartphones. The great thing about free security camera software is that you can test it out first without the risk of losing your money.</p>

You often need a good video editor and trimmer to make your video clips usable.</p>
<p>This is especially true when video recordings can go on for as long as 90 days at a time.

<p>There is a free version of NetCam Studio, but if you want something more powerful, then you can buy one of their licenses. These licenses allow you to use the software for as long as you like, and they will update the software for up to two years after purchase.</p>
<p>After the two-year period, you can keep the software running as normal, but if you want upgrades, then you will have to buy them. Upgrades shouldn’t be needed unless you buy a new piece of camera hardware and it requires a new type of camera software.</p>
<p><strong>The NetCam Studio Features</strong></p>
<p>If you go for the free version of NetCam Studio, then you get to use a camera feed from two sources. There is a watermark added to the camera images, and you get five-day notifications. There is also community support.</p>
<p>The paid features include up to 64 sources, no watermarks, 250-day notifications, and you get priority support. After the 250 days is up, you may buy upgrades in order to keep the notification system going.</p>
<p><strong>Pros</strong></p>
<p>The free version does not expire in any way besides the notifications</p>
<p>You are able to use this software with a wide variety of camera brands</p>
<p>Updates are frequent enough to tackle most system-breaking bugs</p>
<p><strong>Cons</strong></p>
<p>The interface needs updating to make it more user friendly</p>
<p>They need to better explain the “Add Source” procedure</p>
<p>Troubleshooting audio problems is very difficult</p>

<p>The reason Security Eye ranks so highly is that it is a professional piece of software that somebody decided should be free. It is not open source security camera software, but the developers have decided that it should be free. There used to be a free version where you would get 2 hours of free surveillance per day for free, but in 2019 the company removed its payment system. Will they keep it up or go back to paid subscriptions? Who knows, but you should get it while it is still free (if you can).</p>
<p><strong>Security Eye Features</strong></p>
<p>You can use a timer to determine when the video feed should start. You can capture images as JPEGs and then compress them. The system also allows you to receive alerts via a loudspeaker. It works with motion-detection devices too.</p>
<p><strong>Pros</strong></p>
<p>It comes with the Xvid MPEG-4 Codec</p>
<p>The full version has no nag screen or recording limit</p>
<p>The Security Eye interface is pretty modern for what is essentially a free piece of software</p>
<p><strong>Cons</strong></p>
<p>Demands 1GB of RAM and 2GB of HHD space</p>
<p>Requires at least an Intel Pentium 1.8 processor</p>
<p>The icons should be more intuitive</p>

<p>There are three types of free security camera software for you to choose from. There is one for IP cameras, one for web cameras, and there is a piece of viewing software that people may use if they do not have something like VLC video viewer installed.</p>
<p><strong>Perfect Surveillance Features</strong></p>
<p>Simple icons and a clear interface is a great benefits. Determine when the cameras start monitoring and set up your own layouts to suit your viewing style.</p>
<p><strong>Pros</strong></p>
<p>A simple program that works in a very uncomplicated manner</p>
<p>Most of its icons are intuitive to where you can guess what they do</p>
<p>The Perfect Surveillance system has motion detection and allows you to monitor up to 64 devices</p>
<p><strong>Cons</strong></p>
<p>Installing seems overly long and bloated</p>
<p>There are not enough instructions on how to get your cameras connected</p>
<p>They do not explain how to capture and export screenshots</p>

<p>There are times when a piece of free software simply does its job good enough to warrant no complaints, and that is exactly what iVideon offers. There are plenty of ways it can be improved, but there is nothing about it that demands harsh criticism.</p>
<p><strong>iVideon Features</strong></p>
<p>One of its most advertised features is facial recognition, but it is not very accurate. It does allow for very good mobile usage. You can view live and recorded footage on your desktop or mobile device. It is also available for Mac OS X and Linux.</p>
<p><strong>Pros</strong></p>
<p>Online home use and access is completely full-featured and freeware</p>
<p>It has smart notifications and has its own desktop and mobile apps</p>
<p>it doesn’t take long to learn how to use the iVideon interface</p>
<p><strong>Cons</strong></p>
<p>Seems rather light on features</p>
<p>Installing and connecting cameras requires a better tutorial</p>
<p>Embedding live video on your website is trickier than it first seems</p>

<p>This program has plenty of features, but most of them are locked off to free users. It takes over too long to learn how to use the system, but it may be worth it if you have many cameras. The paid version has all sorts of perks from SMS texts to system health monitoring.</p>
<p><strong>Xeoma Features</strong></p>
<p>The lite version is the free version. It allows you to add four cameras with up to six modules in each chain. You can test out and use the lite version as long as you like, or you can get a free trial of the larger fully-featured program.</p>
<p><strong>Pros</strong></p>
<p>Record and monitor from four cameras</p>
<p>Updates are very frequent</p>
<p>This software works with mostly every type of camera</p>
<p><strong>Cons</strong></p>
<p>Around 90% of features are locked off to free users.</p>
<p>Xeoma is difficult to learn and set up</p>
<p>Connecting many cameras is difficult because the system is difficult to learn as a whole</p>

<p>The Genius Vision system is a fairly advanced piece of software that is probably best used for businesses. If used at home, then there are many features that may never be used. It also works on mobile devices too.</p>
<p><strong>Genius Vision Features</strong></p>
<p>There are plenty of features to play with, including a massive array of settings to fit the many types of camera that this program can be used with. You can even support the company through Patreon and get more extensions on the program.</p>
<p><strong>Pros</strong></p>
<p>Works in-depth with many types of camera</p>
<p>The tools are very sophisticated and accurate</p>
<p>The drop-down menus are complicated while also being thoughtfully laid out</p>
<p><strong>Cons</strong></p>
<p>Getting paid upgrades is trickier than just buying on their website</p>
<p>Setting up the remote features is difficult</p>
<p>You have to figure out most of how to use the program based on which camera you have connected</p>

<p>The Deskshare IP Camera Viewer company has a great piece of security camera software that they repackage into many different names and then give away on their website. They do this because the software comes with lots of unwanted bloatware that the company is paid to promote. The sad part is that many other websites will replace this bloatware with Trojan viruses, which means it is difficult to get a clean version of this program.</p>
<p><strong>Deskshare IP Camera Viewer Features</strong></p>
<p>Live recording, playback, and split-screen is all available. You can use up to 4 cameras at a time, and it works with 2200 different camera models. If your hardware allows it, then you can pan, tilt and zoom your camera.</p>
<p><strong>Pros</strong></p>
<p>It is compatible with many types of camera brand</p>
<p>You can set up floating surveillance windows if you want</p>
<p>Adjust the properties of each camera individually</p>
<p><strong>Cons</strong></p>
<p>Installing is very difficult to do correctly</p>
<p>Comes with bloatware and&#x2F;or unwanted content</p>
<p>The IP software has the least features of all the Deskshare camera software</p>

                ></p>
<p>The Anycam system is a very average piece of software, but it works with most any type of camera. The interface is basic but easy to use and easy to set up. You will discover that the free version is only limited in terms of record time, you can still use all its features.</p>
<p><strong>Anycam Features</strong></p>
<p>Anycam is mostly featureless. It works with motion-detection cameras. It allows for video recording and playback. Plus, you can watch a live feed. Other than that, there is very little you can do with this basic-but-effective piece of software.</p>
<p><strong>Pros</strong></p>
<p>The program seems to work with any type of camera</p>
<p>Anycam has a paid version where you only make a one-time payment and get free lifetime updates</p>
<p>Installing and setup is very easy</p>
<p><strong>Cons</strong></p>
<p>Trying to find specific events on the timeline is very fiddly</p>
<p>The free version only allows two cameras to be linked</p>
<p>The recording is very limited with the free version</p>

                ></p>
<p>In the strictest terms, this piece of software is not free. The developers ask you for a donation, but there is nothing forcing you to give them one. Plus, you can try the software, and then if it turns out to be brilliant, then you can always go back and donate to them.</p>
<p><strong>ContaCam Features</strong></p>
<p>Despite seeming very complicated, the interface is actually very self-explanatory. At first glance, it looks overly condensed and full of features, but each explains itself very well. You can configure the cameras very precisely to the point where you can even specify within which seconds it starts and stops.</p>
<p><strong>Pros</strong></p>
<p>A rather advanced piece of software</p>
<p>The interface layout is very condensed without being confusing</p>
<p>You can use web servers, the Internet, or intranet to receive live feeds</p>
<p><strong>Cons</strong></p>
<p>The interface has no aesthetic decoration at all</p>
<p>ContaCam takes a long time to learn through trial and error testing</p>
<p>The developers say this will never work with mobile devices</p>

                      alt="best free security camera software"
                ></p>
<p>The great thing about Agent DVR is that it is completely free because it is freeware. The sad part is that it was created by a developer who went on to finer things and left the program lodged on a few high-use servers. It is now being passed around freeware websites, which means it is sometimes difficult to find a clean version. Nevertheless, it is a fine piece of camera software that still works for many types of cameras.</p>
<p><strong>Agent DVR Features</strong></p>
<p>The Agent DVR software allows for video surveillance with a live feed, and for recording. You can use it with motion-detection software, and it still works for many different types of cameras. It uses a reliable SSL algorithm for its signal encryption, and it is very lightweight, which means it is not a big drain on your device’s CPU.</p>
<p><strong>Pros</strong></p>
<p>A very simple and lightweight piece of software</p>
<p>Works all the way back to Windows 7</p>
<p>It still works with motion detection systems</p>
<p><strong>Cons</strong></p>
<p>Agent DVR will become more obsolete as newer cameras appear over the coming years</p>
<p>Updates will never occur beyond Windows 10</p>
<p>The interface looks very dated compared to the modern camera software</p>
<h2 id="Conclusion-7"><a href="#Conclusion-7" class="headerlink" title="Conclusion"></a>Conclusion</h2><p>As you can tell by this article, getting good security camera software is difficult because there is so much to choose from. Plus, installing is often an issue, as is companies trying to nag-free users into paying. There is also the issue of connecting cameras and the problem with tagged-on viruses and bloatware.</p>
<p>Nevertheless, there is plenty to try without having to pay, so that is a positive. What do you think?</p>
<p>Have any of these worked for you? Ask your friends on social media, start a discussion, and share this article to help others discover the best free security camera software.</p>

<p>Finding suitable video editing software is quite a difficult task. There are so many choices and at the present scenario, loads of tools come for free even.

This program enables you to copy, paste and select or delete multiple portions from a video file. It’s easy-to-use and has keyboard shortcuts which makes the job of editing WMV much easily. However, it’s compiled as a 32-bit Windows and thus makes its major drawbacks from other users who are already using 64-bit Windows.</p>

<p>Finding suitable video editing software is quite a difficult task. There are so many choices and at the present scenario, loads of tools come for free even. So, it is a natural trend for the people to incline for the free video editing tools rather than spending money on a tool, which offers nothing but almost the same features. Here is a list of top five free WMV video editing tools, which feature almost all sorts of casual video editing needs.</p>
<hr>
<p>If you need a more professional video editing tool, <a class="link"   target="_blank" rel="noopener" href="https://tools.techidaily.com/wondershare/filmora/download/" >Wondershare Filmora <i class="fa-regular fa-arrow-up-right-from-square fa-sm"></i></a> is highly recommended. It allows you to create Hollywood-like home movies with titles, effects and transitions from all regular videos, audios and photos. All the video editing tools including trim, split, crop, etc are provided. After editing videos, you can even use the software to share with family and friends, convert videos to different formats and burn DVD.</p>
