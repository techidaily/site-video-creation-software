Smartphones, compact or GoPro cameras can all capture [high-quality videos](https://tools.techidaily.com/wondershare/filmora/download/), but you also need video editing software to process the footage you record. The Windows Movie Maker was discontinued in 2017 and at the moment, finding a video editing software for the Windows 10 operating system that offers only basic tools can prove to be a challenging task.

However, there is no shortage of video editing apps you can use on the latest version of Windows, and in this article, we are going to explore some of the best free and paid options that can help you polish your videos on a Windows 10 computer before posting them online.

## Best Free and Paid Movie Makers for Windows 10

The list of things you should consider before you choose a video editing software for Windows10 is a lengthy one. There is no reason to spend a lot of money on an app that offers[professional video editing tools](https://tools.techidaily.com/wondershare/filmora/download/) if you’re just starting out since there are more affordable options that can help you create captivating videos. Let's take a look at some of the best free and paid movie makers for Windows 10.

#### 1. [Microsoft Photos](https://www.microsoft.com/en-us/p/microsoft-photos/9wzdncrfjbh4): Best Free Movie Maker for Windows10

**Price:** Free

**Compatibility**: Windows 10, version 15063.0 or higher

The replacement of the Windows Movie Maker came in the form of updates to the Microsoft Photos app that now offers video editing options. Don’t expect too much, as the software’s video editing tools are limited to the essentials. You can easily perform tasks such as trimming the clips, adding music, or applying visual effects. The Remix feature lets you combine photos and videos into a single file instantly, and it can be quite useful if you’re just looking for a way to quickly make a video. Despite some attractive video editing tools, the Microsoft Photos app remains an option best suited for beginners.

Tips: Want to know how to edit videos with the Windows 10 Photos movie maker and Remix feature? Check out this article about [Windows10 Photos video editing](https://tools.techidaily.com/wondershare/filmora/download/).

#### 2. [Wondershare Filmora](https://tools.techidaily.com/wondershare/filmora/download/): Best Video Editing Software for Windows 10 \[Free Download\]

**Price:** Free version available, $49.99 for a 1-year subscription

You can export videos from Filmora directly to your accounts on social media such as YouTube and Vimeo, or save them to your hard drive. If you choose the free version of the software, the videos you export will contain watermarks.

The Filmora team has created many tutorials about Filmora editing tips and tricks on their [YouTube channel](https://www.youtube.com/channel/UCY%5FLMaDAoa6hwHKBE4Dx56w), and also a complete guide for beginners about [How to Edit Videos](https://tools.techidaily.com/wondershare/filmora/download/) in Filmora.

#### 3. [Ezvid for Windows](https://www.ezvid.com/ezvid%5Ffor%5Fwindows)

**Price:** Free

**Compatibility:** Windows 10/8/8.1/7/Vista/XP SP3/

![Ezvid for Windows interface ](https://images.wondershare.com/filmora/article-images/ezvid-video-maker.png)

Image from the Internet

Ezvid is primarily a screen capturing software that also offers a decent amount of video editing options. It is a great choice if you want to record video games you play or create tutorials, as you can easily define the area of the screen you’d like to capture and record all on-screen movement. The Voice Synthesis feature lets you create narration quickly, while text overlays or screen drawing options can help you highlight the most important parts of the video. Ezvid doesn’t support a lot of different video file formats, which can limit your choices during the video editing process.

#### 4. [CyberLink PowerDirector 365](https://www.cyberlink.com/products/powerdirector-video-editing-software/features%5Fen%5FUS.html)

**Price: $19.99/Monthly**

**Compatibility:** Windows 10

PC owners who often work with HD and 4K footage, and even 360-degree videos are going to love editing in CyberLink PowerDirector. There are dozens of visual effects available as well as lens correction tools and a Motion Tracking feature that lets you blur faces or add moving text to your videos. The Multi-Camera Editor makes combining and editing footage from several sources simple and enables you to quickly switch between shots recorded by different cameras. The software’s audio editing capabilities are as impressive as its video editing tools, which means that you can create perfect soundtracks for all videos you edit with PowerDirector.

#### 5. [Adobe Premiere Pro CC](https://www.adobe.com/products/premiere.html)

**Price:** $20.99 for a monthly subscription

**Compatibility:** Windows 10 (64-bit version)

Adobe Premiere is one of the most powerful video makers ever created, as it offers virtually unlimited video editing possibilities. However, learning how to use this iconic software may take some time, since most of its features are aimed at professional filmmakers. In addition, there is no reason to pay for a $20 monthly subscription if you have no intention of ever using the majority of options the software offers. Adobe Premiere Pro CC is only a good option for Windows 10 users who constantly need access to a powerful video maker that enables them to edit their videos like professionals.

Premiere Pro has a 30-day limited trial version (with watermark included), so you can download it free on your Windows10 computer. I've done some research and found a YouTube tutorial for beginners to learn Premiere Pro CC Basics from YouTube channel Organge83\. Check it below:

**Conclusion**

Despite the fact that Windows 10 offers a limited amount of video editing software options, it isn’t too difficult to find a video maker that meets all your needs. A number of [affordable and versatile video makers](https://tools.techidaily.com/wondershare/filmora/download/) like Wondershare Filmora is available to PC owners who don’t want to use a professional video editing app like Adobe Premiere Pro CC, but they still need software that is powerful enough to create a high-quality video. What is your favorite video maker for Windows 10? Leave a comment and let us know.
