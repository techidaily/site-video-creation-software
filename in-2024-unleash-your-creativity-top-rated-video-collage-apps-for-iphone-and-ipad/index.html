<p>We all record more videos with our Smartphones or cameras than we can possibly share on social media, and we often don’t get the chance to show some of our favorite moments to our friends. Video collage apps for iPhones and iPads offer an easy solution to this problem because they enable you to merge multiple video clips into a single video. You don’t even need to have advanced video editing skills in order to create visually stunning video collages, as most of these apps are extremely easy to use. So in this article, we are going to take you through some of the best video collage apps of iOS devices.</p>
<h2 id="Best-Free-and-Paid-Video-Collage-Apps-for-iPhone-and-iPad"><a href="#Best-Free-and-Paid-Video-Collage-Apps-for-iPhone-and-iPad" class="headerlink" title="Best Free and Paid Video Collage Apps for iPhone and iPad"></a>Best Free and Paid Video Collage Apps for iPhone and iPad</h2><p>Even though selecting a video collage app isn’t a very complicated process, there are still a number of factors you need to consider before you choose to install a video collage app on your iPad or iPhone. Checking the list of features an app offers and making sure that it allows you to adjust each clip you include in a collage separately or to add music to your creations will help you determine if the app you’re interested in is the right choice for you. The selection of video collage presets or the border and background adjustment features should also be considered while choosing a video collage app. Let’s take a look at some of the best video collage apps you can find at the AppStore.</p>

                      alt="Video Collage Making Apps for iPhone &amp; iPad "
                ></p>
<p>As its name suggests, this app allows you to create both photo and video collages. You can either use the existing material from your camera roll or use the Video Collage and Photo Grid app to capture new footage. You can choose from 64 fully customizable layouts and pick the texture or the color of the frames of each video or photo you include in the collage. The app also lets you adjust the sizes of the still and moving images you’re combining and it also offers the possibility to crop photos you’d like to use in your collages. The sound volume can be easily adjusted, but you must make an in-app purchase in order to unlock the background music feature.</p>

                     src="/images/loading.svg"

                      alt="PicPlayPost Movie Video Editor - Video Collage Making App "
                ></p>
<p>This versatile app can be used for much more than just creating video collages, as it offers the option to capture videos in Full HD and 4K resolutions, although the 4K option is only available on iPhone Xs and iPad Pro. Moreover, you can combine several video collages into a single video and apply a variety of transitions to ensure the smooth flow of the output video. Adding text layers, recording voiceovers or creating soundtracks for your video collages are just a few options you’ll have at your disposal if you install the PicPlayPost movie video editor on your iOS-based device. In case you’re planning on using this app on a daily basis, you should consider purchasing the Everything Pack that costs just $24.99.</p>

<p><strong>Compatibility:</strong> iOS 10.0 or later</p>
<p><img

                      alt="Video Collage Making Apps for iPhone &amp; iPad "
                ></p>
<p>The fact that PicStich offers more than 300 different layouts speaks volumes about its capabilities. However, the majority of the app’s features are designed to help you create photo collages. You can still add a song you like to a video collage to make it more entertaining to watch, but unfortunately, PicStich doesn’t let you apply transitions or adjust playback speeds of the videos you include in a video collage. Purchasing Frames and Borders packs will extend the scope of your options and enable you to increase the quality of the video collages you’re making.

Video collage apps for iPhones and iPads offer an easy solution to this problem because they enable you to merge multiple video clips into a single video. You don’t even need to have advanced video editing skills in order to create visually stunning video collages, as most of these apps are extremely easy to use. So in this article, we are going to take you through some of the best video collage apps of iOS devices.</p>

The selection of video collage presets or the border and background adjustment features should also be considered while choosing a video collage app. Let’s take a look at some of the best video collage apps you can find at the AppStore.</p>

The app also lets you adjust the sizes of the still and moving images you’re combining and it also offers the possibility to crop photos you’d like to use in your collages. The sound volume can be easily adjusted, but you must make an in-app purchase in order to unlock the background music feature.</p>

<p>This versatile app can be used for much more than just creating video collages, as it offers the option to capture videos in Full HD and 4K resolutions, although the 4K option is only available on iPhone Xs and iPad Pro. Moreover, you can combine several video collages into a single video and apply a variety of transitions to ensure the smooth flow of the output video.

<p>The fact that PicStich offers more than 300 different layouts speaks volumes about its capabilities. However, the majority of the app’s features are designed to help you create photo collages. You can still add a song you like to a video collage to make it more entertaining to watch, but unfortunately, PicStich doesn’t let you apply transitions or adjust playback speeds of the videos you include in a video collage. Purchasing Frames and Borders packs will extend the scope of your options and enable you to increase the quality of the video collages you’re making. The app’s file-sharing capabilities are impressive since you can export your projects directly to Instagram or Dropbox and you can also share all of your creations to Facebook, Twitter, and other popular social networks.</p>

You don’t even need to have advanced video editing skills in order to create visually stunning video collages, as most of these apps are extremely easy to use.

<p><strong>Step 1:</strong> Once you open the Video Stabilizer option, you will be asked to either upload the video you’d like to stabilize from the hard drive on your computer or paste the video’s URL if the clip you want to stabilize is stored online. Hit the Upload Video button after you perform either of these actions and wait for the upload process to be finalized.</p>
<p><strong>Step 2:</strong> To initiate the video stabilization process, you just have to click on the Stabilize button. The process will start automatically and its duration depends on the size of the file you’re stabilizing.</p>

<p><strong>Step 1:</strong> Upon arriving at video-stabilize.com, you can simply drag and drop the video file to the designated box. Alternatively, you can click on the Upload your movie button or you can upload the video using Dropbox, OneDrive or Google Drive.

<p><strong>Step 1:</strong> Head over to your YouTube channel and upload a video by clicking on the Camera icon in the upper right corner of the screen. Before the upload starts you can change the Privacy settings from Public to Private so your video won’t be visible to other YouTube users.</p>
<p><strong>Step 2:</strong> After the video is uploaded to your channel, open the Creator Studio and click on the Video Manager option.

<p><strong>Step 1:</strong> Head over to your YouTube channel and upload a video by clicking on the Camera icon in the upper right corner of the screen. Before the upload starts you can change the Privacy settings from Public to Private so your video won’t be visible to other YouTube users.</p>
<p><strong>Step 2:</strong> After the video is uploaded to your channel, open the Creator Studio and click on the Video Manager option. This action will enable you to see the video you’ve just uploaded. Click on the Edit button that is located below the video and proceed to open the Enhancements tab in the YouTube’s video editor.</p>
<p><strong>Step 3:</strong> In the Enhancements tab, you’ll be able to see the Stabilize icon. Click on it to start the video stabilization process, and once the process is complete, you can copy the video’s URL and share it on social media or send it to your friends.</p>

<p>123 Apps is a favorite website for many creative heads, and the reasons are quite logical. The website is home to a different video, audio, and photo editing tools. So, if you’re talking specifically about what you can do to your videos with 123 Apps, here’s a little glimpse.</p>
<ul>
<li>Trimming</li>
<li>Merging</li>
<li>Inserting audio and photos into video</li>

</ul>
<p>And, of course, the <strong>free video stabilization.</strong></p>
<p>Online Video Stabilizer by 123 Apps allows you to remove shakiness from videos shot on any device. So be it a drone, GoPro, iPhone, or an Android, this web-based tool welcomes all.</p>
<p>It’s a free online service with 30+ video codecs ensuring support to all prominent video formats, such as MOV, WEBM, MP4, WMV, AVI, and more.</p>
<p>You can follow these steps to stabilize your shaky video without paying a cent:</p>
<p><strong>“ 1:</strong> Go to the 123 Apps Online Video Stabilizer website. Click on the “Open File” button to upload your video. Depending on the internet speed and video size, the upload might take a few seconds to several minutes. However, you should remember that this platform only allows uploading 700MB of video.</p>
<p><strong>Step 2:</strong>  After uploading the video, activate the tool and choose the portion of the video that you need to stabilize. Once selected, click the “Play” button to see the results.</p>
<p><strong>Step 3:</strong>  Next, choose your output video format from the options by selecting the gear icon. By default, the tool is set to MP4 output, so make sure to change it if you want to download the video in your preferred format.</p>

                ></p>
<p>Don’”get confused by the name, as this online tool is a gateway to numerous video editing solutions. MP4Compress helps you stabilize shaky footage with ease. Plus, it has many more features to help you make the video look more professional.</p>
<p>For example, the core feature is video conversion to different formats. Likewise, you can compress the videos, make them greyscale, and remove the sound. Contrarily, if you want to stabilize the video through MP4Compress, here’s what you need to do:</p>
<p><strong>Step 1:</strong> Go to the website, click the “Select file…” button, and choose the video you want that’s troubling you with its shakiness. Keep in mind that you can only upload MP4 files (500MB maximum).</p>
<p>So, if you have a video in other video formats, you will need to convert it into MP4 first.</p>
<p><strong>Step 2:</strong>  After selecting the video, click the “Upload Video File” button to start the process.</p>
<p><strong>Step 3:</strong>  Once this tool corrects the shaky video, save it on your computer.</p>

<p>Stabilizo is another pick to stabilize shaky videos online for free. While the software also offers other services like a PDF converter and video compressor, the tool is famous for stabilizing videos recorded on different devices.</p>
<p>Usually, it takes a few minutes to work on the video, but it depends on the size of your footage and internet speed. If the video is recorded at a high resolution or you have slow internet, Stabilizo might take more than 5 minutes to do the job.</p>
<p>This is how the tool works:</p>
<p><strong>Step 1:</strong> Go to the website and click the “Browse” button to select the video you want to stabilize.</p>
<p><strong>Step 2:</strong> Click the “Upload Video” button to upload the video (500MB max) on the tool and wait until the software stabilizes the video.</p>

<p>VideoUtils is a complete pack of great tools for online video editing. You can rely on this free web-based program for audio, image, video, and even PDF editing. Nevertheless, you can simply check the “Video Stabilizer” tool to correct the shakiness you’ve got in your video during recording.</p>
