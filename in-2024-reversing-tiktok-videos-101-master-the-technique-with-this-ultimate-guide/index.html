<p><a class="link"   target="_blank" rel="noopener" href="https://www.tiktok.com/en/" >TikTok <i class="fa-regular fa-arrow-up-right-from-square fa-sm"></i></a> is the latest of media sharing applications to cause a worldwide frenzy and gain a huge number of users practically overnight. A big reason for its success is the large number of fun features that allow the users to alter their videos with just a few clicks.</p>
<p>With cool effects and filters, it’s possible to create a wide range of videos that catch the viewer’s attention and put a smile on his face. On the other hand, videos can be created and shared from mobile phones in seconds, enabling its users to show a lot of different situations and express a lot of ideas.</p>
<p>Reversing is also one of the popular options on TikTok and it can be readily performed even without deeper knowledge of video production and editing. Here is how you can do it effectively, either with built-in tools provided by TikTok or with additional pieces of software.</p>

<h2 id="How-to-Make-A-Reversing-TikTok-Video-3"><a href="#How-to-Make-A-Reversing-TikTok-Video-3" class="headerlink" title="How to Make A Reversing TikTok Video?"></a>How to Make A Reversing TikTok Video?</h2><p>Changing the direction of the video, i.e. playing it backwards, is not hard to achieve on TikTok at all. In fact, there is a dedicated function you can use to reverse your video instantly and without leaving the app.</p>
<p>To activate this function, you need to click on the Effects button at the bottom of the screen and then select the Time effects category. The reverse option can be found in this menu, and it will change the direction of the entire clip.</p>
<p><img

                      alt="Reverse video on TikTok"
                ></p>
<p>After you click on Reverse and review your new video, all you need to do is to save the file and it is ready to be shared with the public. The entire process lasts just a few seconds and doesn’t require any technical skills, so anyone can take advantage of this simple effect to create exciting videos that play with the concept of time and resonate with the online audience.</p>
<h2 id="How-to-Play-Someone-Else’s-Video-in-Reverse-on-TikTok-3"><a href="#How-to-Play-Someone-Else’s-Video-in-Reverse-on-TikTok-3" class="headerlink" title="How to Play Someone Else’s Video in Reverse on TikTok?"></a>How to Play Someone Else’s Video in Reverse on TikTok?</h2><p>TikTok only allows video authors to reverse their own videos if they want, but viewers can’t just watch the videos they see online backwards. They are limited to straightforward viewing, although it is possible to jump forward to any part of the clip.</p>
<p><img  
                     lazyload
                     src="/images/loading.svg"
                     data-src="https://images.wondershare.com/filmora/article-images/reverse-vid-play-it-backwards.jpg"
                      alt="Reverse Vid for iOS"
                ></p>
<p>The only solution to this limitation involves external playback tools, so if you really want to watch a certain video in reverse you could try to download it to your phone and use a different video player. For example, iPhone owners can pick up a third-party app like <a class="link"   target="_blank" rel="noopener" href="https://apps.apple.com/us/app/reverse-vid-play-it-backwards/id950551948" >Reverse Vid <i class="fa-regular fa-arrow-up-right-from-square fa-sm"></i></a> from the App Store that lets them use reverse playback. Once the app is installed and the video is stored on the phone, there is nothing preventing the user from watching it backwards on the mobile screen.</p>
<h2 id="How-to-Reverse-A-Video-on-CupCut-And-Share-It-on-TikTok-3"><a href="#How-to-Reverse-A-Video-on-CupCut-And-Share-It-on-TikTok-3" class="headerlink" title="How to Reverse A Video on CupCut And Share It on TikTok?"></a>How to Reverse A Video on CupCut And Share It on TikTok?</h2><p>Users who know a bit more about video editing and want more control over the final product can use external tools instead of TikTok’s own function. There are many video editors for TikTok that could do the trick, but CupCut is one of the simplest apps that will work from your phone and can be downloaded for free.</p>
<p>In CupCut, you can precisely select the part of the video you want to reverse and even adjust playback speed if you want. That gives you more creative freedom and unlocks the possibility to attempt more ambitious visual ideas.</p>
<p>Of course, once you reverse the video in CupCut you will need to export it to TikTok before you can share it with your contacts. Since both of those apps support the same video formats, this process should run very smoothly and without any compatibility issues.</p>
<h2 id="Is-It-Possible-to-Reverse-Video-and-Audio-at-The-Same-Time-3"><a href="#Is-It-Possible-to-Reverse-Video-and-Audio-at-The-Same-Time-3" class="headerlink" title="Is It Possible to Reverse Video and Audio at The Same Time?"></a>Is It Possible to Reverse Video and Audio at The Same Time?</h2><p>In some cases, reversing the audio stream could make the video even more impressive but unfortunately, TikTok doesn’t directly support this possibility. However, more <a class="link"   target="_blank" rel="noopener" href="https://tools.techidaily.com/wondershare/filmora/download/" >advanced editing software <i class="fa-regular fa-arrow-up-right-from-square fa-sm"></i></a> suits give you the option to have both video and audio run backwards in unison. For example, you can use <a class="link"   target="_blank" rel="noopener" href="https://filmora.wondershare.net/filmora-video-editor.html" >Wondershare Filmora <i class="fa-regular fa-arrow-up-right-from-square fa-sm"></i></a> for this purpose and accomplish the task in several easy steps.</p>
<p>First, you need to set up the project to 9:16 <a class="link"   target="_blank" rel="noopener" href="https://tools.techidaily.com/wondershare/filmora/download/" >aspect ratio <i class="fa-regular fa-arrow-up-right-from-square fa-sm"></i></a> since the video will be shared on TikTok. And then you can import the video footage to Filmora.</p>
<p>To reverse the video and audio at the same time, right-click the clip in the timeline and then select <strong>Speed and Duration</strong>. In the Custom Speed window, check the <strong>Reverse Speed</strong> option and click <strong>OK</strong> to save the changes.</p>
<p>Play the clip and you will find the video and audio is reversed at the same time.</p>
<p>If you don’t want to reverse the audio, you can <a class="link"   target="_blank" rel="noopener" href="https://tools.techidaily.com/wondershare/filmora/download/" >detach the audio from the video <i class="fa-regular fa-arrow-up-right-from-square fa-sm"></i></a> first and then reverse the video separately.</p>
<p>When you complete these steps, you are ready to export the video and re-import the reversed clip back into TikTok.</p>

<p>As it is now the second decade of the 21st century, data carriers like DVDs are slowly becoming obsolete. A growing number of laptop and desktop PCs no longer feature optical disc drives, while the discontinuation of the Windows Media Center marked the end of an era in which Windows OS offered a built-in DVD player.</p>
<p>The Windows 10 doesn’t have a native app that enables you to play movies or music from DVD and Blu-ray discs, and you must install a third-party DVD<a class="link"   target="_blank" rel="noopener" href="https://tools.techidaily.com/wondershare/filmora/download/" >video player <i class="fa-regular fa-arrow-up-right-from-square fa-sm"></i></a> if you want to view content from these sources. Luckily there is no shortage of media players that are compatible with Windows 10, so in this article, we are going to take you through some of the <strong>best free DVD players</strong> on the market and help you choose the one that meets all your needs.</p>
<h2 id="Best-Free-DVD-Players-for-Windows-10"><a href="#Best-Free-DVD-Players-for-Windows-10" class="headerlink" title="Best Free DVD Players for Windows 10"></a>Best Free DVD Players for Windows 10</h2><p>Before you opt for one DVD player or the other you must first check which audio and <a class="link"   target="_blank" rel="noopener" href="https://tools.techidaily.com/wondershare/filmora/download/" >video file formats <i class="fa-regular fa-arrow-up-right-from-square fa-sm"></i></a> they support or find out if you can use them to play Blu-ray discs. You should also check a player’s compatibility with the operating system you have installed on your computer and that you have all the codecs necessary to play ISO and other image, audio and video file format. So let’s take a look at ten best free DVD players for Windows 10.</p>
<h3 id="1-VLC-Media-Player-by-VideoLan"><a href="#1-VLC-Media-Player-by-VideoLan" class="headerlink" title="1.

<p>What’s more, playing a DVD or a Blu-ray with VLC is a simple task you can complete in just a few clicks. The Open Disc option that is located in the player’s Media menu enables you to choose if you would like to open a DVD, VCD, Audio CD or Blu-ray disc. Moreover, you won’t need to install additional  or MPEG-4 codecs, since VLC can play the vast majority of video files regardless of the codec they are using.</p>
