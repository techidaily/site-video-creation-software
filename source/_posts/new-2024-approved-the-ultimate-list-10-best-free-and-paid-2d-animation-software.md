Stop motion animation is becoming more and more popular by the year, and itâ€™s not surprising. This style of making animated films is done by taking objects, either dolls with joints or soft clay items, and manipulating them. The physical manipulations and changes are then photographed. Each photograph acts as a frame, and when you play the frames together quickly, it looks like the objects have been animated.

If you want to make this type of animation, then you want to find the best **stop motion animation software** that you can find. Some options out there are even free! In this article, weâ€™re going to share the 8 best options for stop motion animation software, separating them by whether they are for Mac or PC.
