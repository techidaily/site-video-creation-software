 Mar 27, 2024• Proven solutions

Wondershare Filmora is among the best video software for content creators such as YouTube Vloggers, social media influencers, movie creators, and more. It can work with both Windows and Mac. Due to its multiple features, everyone wants to have Filmora for editing their content. But not all features of this video editing software are free. However, you can [get Filmora for free](https://tools.techidaily.com/wondershare/filmora/download/)using Torrent.

So, if you are looking for a **Filmora** **torrent**, then don't worry. We have got you covered. We have discussed the setbacks and the methods to get Filmora for free in this article. Let's dive in.

* [Part 1: Risks of Using Illegal Filmora Torrent](#part1)
* [Part 2: Amazing Features of Filmora You Should Try in 2021](#part2)

---

## Part 1  Risks of Using Illegal Filmora Torrent You Should Know

Well, there are some drawbacks and multiple threats that your PC will have to face when you download Wondershare Filmora Torrent. Some of the disadvantages and drawbacks are listed below.

### 1\.  Lack of Assistance

One of the significant setbacks of using illegal means to get Filmora is that you will not receive any technical assistance from the developer because you have not genuinely purchased the software. Moreover, if an issue occurred in your version of Filmora, you cannot even report it and get technical assistance to fix it permanently.

### 2\.  Illegal

Using an application or software that you have not genuinely purchased is a crime everywhere. However, its punishment may vary depending on the countries or regions.

### 3\.  Lack of Updates

Getting Wondershare Filmora through Torrent will block all the communication with its server. Due to this, neither will you get the notifications about the updates, nor will you be able to update your application. In a nutshell, you will get stuck with the installed version of Filmora, which will get old with time.

### 41\.  Lagging

Downloading the Filmora X torrent means you're getting a crack version, which can never match the integrity and speed of the actual version itself. Since the software's code is modified not to need an activation key to unlock all the features, the software will experience lagging whenever you use it.

### 3\.  Virus

Getting software through illegal means comes with many setbacks, and the virus is one of them. The modified copy of Filmora is not as secure as the original one. For cracking the software, they modify the .exe file, making it vulnerable to multiple threats and viruses that can harm your PC.

## Part 2  New Features of Filmora You Should Try in 2022

You cannot simply neglect Wondershare Filmora when you are talking about software for video editing that comes with brand-new editing features. Filmora is among the top-rated video editing software. It comes with many helpful features for editing videos in multiple formats. Some of its notable features are:

### 1\.  AI Portrait

AI Portrait is one of the brand-new additions in Wondershare Filmora. It allows you to [remove the background of videos without using a Chroma key and green screen effect](https://tools.techidaily.com/wondershare/filmora/download/). You can also add glitch effects, noise, pixelated borders, segmentation video effects, and many more using AI Portrait on Wondershare Filmora.

[![Download Win Version](https://images.wondershare.com/filmora/guide/download-btn-win.jpg)](https://tools.techidaily.com/wondershare/filmora/download/)[Download Mac Version](https://images.wondershare.com/filmora/guide/download-btn-mac.jpg)](https://tools.techidaily.com/wondershare/filmora/download/)

This feature helps you change the settings of effects and customize it according to your needs. For example, if we are talking about the noise, you can change the Percentage, Edge Thickness, Edge Feather, and Alpha with the help of this tool.

This add-on works perfectly for single and real objects facing the camera. Fast movements, backlight, and multi-person portraits influence the output of the AI portrait. However, you need to purchase this feature to add it to the Wondershare Filmora.

![Filmora remove and change video background ](https://images.wondershare.com/filmora/article-images/add-new-video-background.jpg)

### 2\.  Auto-Reframe

Powered by AI technology, this feature detects the focal point of the video automatically. Auto Reframe allows you to always keep the main object or action of the video in the frame. You can manually change the focal point of the video or opt for an aspect ratio that meets your requirements with the help of Auto Reframe.

[![Download Win Version](https://images.wondershare.com/filmora/guide/download-btn-win.jpg)](https://tools.techidaily.com/wondershare/filmora/download/)[Download Mac Version](https://images.wondershare.com/filmora/guide/download-btn-mac.jpg)](https://tools.techidaily.com/wondershare/filmora/download/)

This feature also helps you select the focal point depending on the platform you want to share your video on. It allows you to adjust the video's speed (i.e., Auto, Slow, or Fast). You can also preview the video in real-time while reframing it.

For auto reframing the video, you need to import the media and then select auto-reframe from the Tools. After selecting the aspect ratio and adjusting the speed, analyze the video and export it in the required format.

![Filmora auto reframe feature](https://images.wondershare.com/filmora/article-images/filmora-auto-reframe-feature.jpg)

### 3\.  AR Stickers

Wondershare Filmora features a wide collection of AR stickers that you can use to emphasize reactions, enhance emotions, and add personality to the video. The face-tracking stickers are image-based filters with fun and attractive elements such as bears, koalas, pandas, cats, glasses, bunnies, and many more. For instance, applying the AR sticker named Heart eyes will automatically add hearts to the person's eyes and start moving with them.

AR stickers work great when tried on an object facing the camera. However, if more than one object is in the frame, the stickers will attach to any face it detects. Moreover, adding AR stickers is no complicated job. You can add them the same way as other filters. You can also delete the applied AR sticker if it looks dull or doesn't fit with your video by right-clicking on it and then selecting **Delete Effect**. However, by selecting delete effects, you will remove all the applied effects, i.e., other than AR stickers.

## Part 1  Risks of Using Illegal Filmora Torrent You Should Know

Well, there are some drawbacks and multiple threats that your PC will have to face when you download Wondershare Filmora Torrent. Some of the disadvantages and drawbacks are listed below.

### 1\.  Lack of Assistance

One of the significant setbacks of using illegal means to get Filmora is that you will not receive any technical assistance from the developer because you have not genuinely purchased the software. Moreover, if an issue occurred in your version of Filmora, you cannot even report it and get technical assistance to fix it permanently.

### 2\.  Illegal

Using an application or software that you have not genuinely purchased is a crime everywhere. However, its punishment may vary depending on the countries or regions.

### 3\.  Lack of Updates

Getting Wondershare Filmora through Torrent will block all the communication with its server. Due to this, neither will you get the notifications about the updates, nor will you be able to update your application. In a nutshell, you will get stuck with the installed version of Filmora, which will get old with time.

### 41\.  Lagging

Downloading the Filmora X torrent means you're getting a crack version, which can never match the integrity and speed of the actual version itself. Since the software's code is modified not to need an activation key to unlock all the features, the software will experience lagging whenever you use it.

### 3\.  Virus

Getting software through illegal means comes with many setbacks, and the virus is one of them. The modified copy of Filmora is not as secure as the original one. For cracking the software, they modify the .exe file, making it vulnerable to multiple threats and viruses that can harm your PC.

## Part 2  New Features of Filmora You Should Try in 2022

You cannot simply neglect Wondershare Filmora when you are talking about software for video editing that comes with brand-new editing features. Filmora is among the top-rated video editing software. It comes with many helpful features for editing videos in multiple formats. Some of its notable features are:

### 1\.  AI Portrait

AI Portrait is one of the brand-new additions in Wondershare Filmora. It allows you to [remove the background of videos without using a Chroma key and green screen effect](https://tools.techidaily.com/wondershare/filmora/download/). You can also add glitch effects, noise, pixelated borders, segmentation video effects, and many more using AI Portrait on Wondershare Filmora.

[![Download Win Version](https://images.wondershare.com/filmora/guide/download-btn-win.jpg)](https://tools.techidaily.com/wondershare/filmora/download/)[Download Mac Version](https://images.wondershare.com/filmora/guide/download-btn-mac.jpg)](https://tools.techidaily.com/wondershare/filmora/download/)

This feature helps you change the settings of effects and customize it according to your needs. For example, if we are talking about the noise, you can change the Percentage, Edge Thickness, Edge Feather, and Alpha with the help of this tool.

This add-on works perfectly for single and real objects facing the camera. Fast movements, backlight, and multi-person portraits influence the output of the AI portrait. However, you need to purchase this feature to add it to the Wondershare Filmora.

![Filmora remove and change video background ](https://images.wondershare.com/filmora/article-images/add-new-video-background.jpg)

### 2\.  Auto-Reframe

Powered by AI technology, this feature detects the focal point of the video automatically. Auto Reframe allows you to always keep the main object or action of the video in the frame. You can manually change the focal point of the video or opt for an aspect ratio that meets your requirements with the help of Auto Reframe.

[![Download Win Version](https://images.wondershare.com/filmora/guide/download-btn-win.jpg)](https://tools.techidaily.com/wondershare/filmora/download/)[Download Mac Version](https://images.wondershare.com/filmora/guide/download-btn-mac.jpg)](https://tools.techidaily.com/wondershare/filmora/download/)

This feature also helps you select the focal point depending on the platform you want to share your video on. It allows you to adjust the video's speed (i.e., Auto, Slow, or Fast). You can also preview the video in real-time while reframing it.

For auto reframing the video, you need to import the media and then select auto-reframe from the Tools. After selecting the aspect ratio and adjusting the speed, analyze the video and export it in the required format.

![Filmora auto reframe feature](https://images.wondershare.com/filmora/article-images/filmora-auto-reframe-feature.jpg)

### 3\.  AR Stickers

Wondershare Filmora features a wide collection of AR stickers that you can use to emphasize reactions, enhance emotions, and add personality to the video. The face-tracking stickers are image-based filters with fun and attractive elements such as bears, koalas, pandas, cats, glasses, bunnies, and many more. For instance, applying the AR sticker named Heart eyes will automatically add hearts to the person's eyes and start moving with them.

AR stickers work great when tried on an object facing the camera. However, if more than one object is in the frame, the stickers will attach to any face it detects. Moreover, adding AR stickers is no complicated job. You can add them the same way as other filters. You can also delete the applied AR sticker if it looks dull or doesn't fit with your video by right-clicking on it and then selecting **Delete Effect**.

## The Ultimate List of Android Apps Everyone Loves

# Best and Most Popular Android Apps of 2024 on Google Play

![author avatar](https://images.wondershare.com/filmora/article-images/richard-bennett.jpg)

##### Richard Bennett

 Mar 27, 2024• Proven solutions

It is hard to believe that in 2024 Google Play had just fifty apps since it currently offers 2.8 million applications that can be used for anything from photo and [video editing](https://tools.techidaily.com/wondershare/filmora/download/) to learning a new language.

This year Google Play had a difficult task of selecting the best app of 2024, as there are so many apps across different categories that are worthy of this award. On December 3rd Google Play announced its choice and also presented the best Android apps of 2024 that were selected by users. So without further ado let’s take a look at the best and most popular Android apps of 2024

## The Best App of 2024 Selected by Google Play: [Ablo](https://play.google.com/store/apps/details?id=live.ablo&hl=en)

Language barriers can prevent us from exploring the world and experiencing different cultures. So, it is no wonder that an app that enables its users to talk to people from around the globe in their mother tongue was chosen as the best app of 2024 by Google Play.

![ 
Ablo: Make new friends from all over the world ](https://images.wondershare.com/filmora/article-images/ablo-chat-app-best-app-google-play.jpg)

Ablo translates all chat messages in real-time which enables you to talk with all likeminded people you meet even if you don’t speak the same language.

The app also translates video calls live and allows you to have meaningful conversations with friends that come from different parts of the world. If you are traveling often and looking for an easy way to encounter the local culture or you just want to communicate with people whose language you don’t understand, then you should install Ablo and start making friends around the world.

## The Most Popular Apps of 2024 on Google Play

Smartphones bring entertainment to the palms of our hands and grant us instant access to information that makes our lives easier. Over the course of 2024 apps from a broad range of categories have sparked the interest of thousands of Android users. Here are some of the most popular apps of 2024 that can help you improve your productivity or make better fashion choices.

### 1\. [Peloton](https://play.google.com/store/apps/details?id=com.onepeloton.callisto&hl=en)

**Price:**Free, but offers in-app purchases

**Supported OS:**Requires Android 5.1 or up

**Category:**Health & Fitness

![InShot Video Editor - Glitch Video Effects ](https://images.wondershare.com/filmora/article-images/peloton-most-popular-app-android.jpg)

Leading a healthy lifestyle is much easier if you have the assistance of the world’s leading instructors. If you already own a Peloton bike or tread, then you can enjoy all the benefits of the Peloton app for free. Yoga, cardio or indoor cycling are just a few among numerous types of classes you can attend through this Android app. In addition, you can also broadcast your workouts through the Peloton’s Chromecast support and share your daily workout routines with thousands of followers. Even so, the app’s interface is somewhat outdated and the app crashes easily during workouts, which makes using Peloton frequently a bit difficult.

### 2\. [21 Buttons](https://play.google.com/store/apps/details?id=com.android21buttons&hl=en)

**Price:**Free

**Supported OS:**Requires Android 5.0 or up

**Category:**Social

![ 
21 Buttons: Fashion Social Network & Clothing Shop](https://images.wondershare.com/filmora/article-images/21-buttons-fashion-social-network-clothing-shop-app.jpg)

If you would like to keep track of the latest fashion trends and discover places where you can buy clothes and accessories worn by your favorite influencers, then you should install the 21 Buttons app on your phone. This social network for fashion enthusiasts can help you choose new outfits and save them in your public or private closets. What’s more, you can share the fashion choices with your followers and link to the stores where particular items can be purchased. This app also enables you to search for up and coming brands, since it is hard to find a fashion brand that isn’t featured on 21 Buttons.

### 3\. [Post-it®](https://play.google.com/store/apps/details?id=com.mmm.postit&hl=en)

**Price:**Free

**Supported OS:**Android 7.0 and up

**Category:**Productivity

![Most popular apps on Google Play - Post-it](https://images.wondershare.com/filmora/article-images/post-it-app-for-android.jpg)

Managing and organizing vast amounts of handwritten notes is a futile effort as sorting out hundreds of tiny pieces of paper is often impossible. Installing the Post-it app that captures handwritten notes and allows you to organize them in any way you want can help you perform your daily tasks more efficiently. Once you’ve created and organized your board you can share it with your colleagues or export it to Excel, PowerPoint or Trello. Post-it can capture more than 200 notes at the same time using your phone’s camera and use the Handwriting Recognition AI to transcribe them. Each not you create with this app can be easily edited or deleted.

### 4\. [Scripts by Drops – Learn to Write](https://play.google.com/store/apps/details?id=com.languagedrops.drops.scrips.learn.write.alphabet.letters.characters.language.japanese.korean.chinese&hl=en)

**Price:**Free, but offers in-app purchases

**Supported OS:**Requires Android 4.4 and up

**Category:**Education

![Scripts by Drops - Learn to write ](https://images.wondershare.com/filmora/article-images/scripts-by-drops-learn-to-write.jpg)

Learning a new language should be a fun process that is not going to take too much of your time. Scripts by Drops limits the total amount of time you can spend practicing a new language to just five minutes a day. Even though this may seem far from enough to master Chinese Hanzi or to learn Russian Cyrillic, this app will deliver the results you’re looking for as long as you keep using it every single day. Scripts by Drops employs visual learning techniques that help the app’s users connect letters and characters to their pronunciations. If you opt for one of the available subscription models you will have an unlimited amount of learning time at your disposal.

### 5\. [Boosted – Productivity and Time Tracker](https://play.google.com/store/apps/details?id=com.boostedproductivity.app&hl=en)

**Price:**Free

**Supported OS:**Requires Android 4.4 and up

**Category:**Productivity

![ 
Boosted - Productivity & Time Tracker](https://images.wondershare.com/filmora/article-images/boosted-productivity-time-tracker.jpg)

 Mar 27, 2024• Proven solutions

It is hard to believe that in 2024 Google Play had just fifty apps since it currently offers 2.8 million applications that can be used for anything from photo and [video editing](https://tools.techidaily.com/wondershare/filmora/download/) to learning a new language.

This year Google Play had a difficult task of selecting the best app of 2024, as there are so many apps across different categories that are worthy of this award. On December 3rd Google Play announced its choice and also presented the best Android apps of 2024 that were selected by users. So without further ado let’s take a look at the best and most popular Android apps of 2024

## The Best App of 2024 Selected by Google Play: [Ablo](https://play.google.com/store/apps/details?id=live.ablo&hl=en)

Language barriers can prevent us from exploring the world and experiencing different cultures. So, it is no wonder that an app that enables its users to talk to people from around the globe in their mother tongue was chosen as the best app of 2024 by Google Play.

![ 
Ablo: Make new friends from all over the world ](https://images.wondershare.com/filmora/article-images/ablo-chat-app-best-app-google-play.jpg)

Ablo translates all chat messages in real-time which enables you to talk with all likeminded people you meet even if you don’t speak the same language.

The app also translates video calls live and allows you to have meaningful conversations with friends that come from different parts of the world. If you are traveling often and looking for an easy way to encounter the local culture or you just want to communicate with people whose language you don’t understand, then you should install Ablo and start making friends around the world.

## The Most Popular Apps of 2024 on Google Play

Smartphones bring entertainment to the palms of our hands and grant us instant access to information that makes our lives easier. Over the course of 2024 apps from a broad range of categories have sparked the interest of thousands of Android users. Here are some of the most popular apps of 2024 that can help you improve your productivity or make better fashion choices.

### 1\. [Peloton](https://play.google.com/store/apps/details?id=com.onepeloton.callisto&hl=en)

**Price:**Free, but offers in-app purchases

**Supported OS:**Requires Android 5.1 or up

**Category:**Health & Fitness

![InShot Video Editor - Glitch Video Effects ](https://images.wondershare.com/filmora/article-images/peloton-most-popular-app-android.jpg)

Leading a healthy lifestyle is much easier if you have the assistance of the world’s leading instructors. If you already own a Peloton bike or tread, then you can enjoy all the benefits of the Peloton app for free. Yoga, cardio or indoor cycling are just a few among numerous types of classes you can attend through this Android app. In addition, you can also broadcast your workouts through the Peloton’s Chromecast support and share your daily workout routines with thousands of followers. Even so, the app’s interface is somewhat outdated and the app crashes easily during workouts, which makes using Peloton frequently a bit difficult.

### 2\. [21 Buttons](https://play.google.com/store/apps/details?id=com.android21buttons&hl=en)

**Price:**Free

**Supported OS:**Requires Android 5.0 or up

**Category:**Social

If you would like to keep track of the latest fashion trends and discover places where you can buy clothes and accessories worn by your favorite influencers, then you should install the 21 Buttons app on your phone. This social network for fashion enthusiasts can help you choose new outfits and save them in your public or private closets. What’s more, you can share the fashion choices with your followers and link to the stores where particular items can be purchased. This app also enables you to search for up and coming brands, since it is hard to find a fashion brand that isn’t featured on 21 Buttons.

### 3\. [Post-it®](https://play.google.com/store/apps/details?id=com.mmm.postit&hl=en)

**Price:**Free

**Supported OS:**Android 7.0 and up

**Category:**Productivity

![Most popular apps on Google Play - Post-it](https://images.wondershare.com/filmora/article-images/post-it-app-for-android.jpg)

Managing and organizing vast amounts of handwritten notes is a futile effort as sorting out hundreds of tiny pieces of paper is often impossible. Installing the Post-it app that captures handwritten notes and allows you to organize them in any way you want can help you perform your daily tasks more efficiently. Once you’ve created and organized your board you can share it with your colleagues or export it to Excel, PowerPoint or Trello. Post-it can capture more than 200 notes at the same time using your phone’s camera and use the Handwriting Recognition AI to transcribe them. Each not you create with this app can be easily edited or deleted.

Scripts by Drops limits the total amount of time you can spend practicing a new language to just five minutes a day. Even though this may seem far from enough to master Chinese Hanzi or to learn Russian Cyrillic, this app will deliver the results you’re looking for as long as you keep using it every single day. Scripts by Drops employs visual learning techniques that help the app’s users connect letters and characters to their pronunciations. If you opt for one of the available subscription models you will have an unlimited amount of learning time at your disposal.

 Mar 27, 2024• Proven solutions

It is hard to believe that in 2024 Google Play had just fifty apps since it currently offers 2.8 million applications that can be used for anything from photo and [video editing](https://tools.techidaily.com/wondershare/filmora/download/) to learning a new language.

This year Google Play had a difficult task of selecting the best app of 2024, as there are so many apps across different categories that are worthy of this award. On December 3rd Google Play announced its choice and also presented the best Android apps of 2024 that were selected by users. So without further ado let’s take a look at the best and most popular Android apps of 2024

## The Best App of 2024 Selected by Google Play: [Ablo](https://play.google.com/store/apps/details?id=live.ablo&hl=en)

Language barriers can prevent us from exploring the world and experiencing different cultures. So, it is no wonder that an app that enables its users to talk to people from around the globe in their mother tongue was chosen as the best app of 2024 by Google Play.

![ 
Ablo: Make new friends from all over the world ](https://images.wondershare.com/filmora/article-images/ablo-chat-app-best-app-google-play.jpg)

Ablo translates all chat messages in real-time which enables you to talk with all likeminded people you meet even if you don’t speak the same language.

The app also translates video calls live and allows you to have meaningful conversations with friends that come from different parts of the world. If you are traveling often and looking for an easy way to encounter the local culture or you just want to communicate with people whose language you don’t understand, then you should install Ablo and start making friends around the world.

## The Most Popular Apps of 2024 on Google Play

Smartphones bring entertainment to the palms of our hands and grant us instant access to information that makes our lives easier. Over the course of 2024 apps from a broad range of categories have sparked the interest of thousands of Android users. Here are some of the most popular apps of 2024 that can help you improve your productivity or make better fashion choices.

### 1\. [Peloton](https://play.google.com/store/apps/details?id=com.onepeloton.callisto&hl=en)

**Price:**Free, but offers in-app purchases

**Supported OS:**Requires Android 5.1 or up

**Category:**Health & Fitness

![InShot Video Editor - Glitch Video Effects ](https://images.wondershare.com/filmora/article-images/peloton-most-popular-app-android.jpg)

Leading a healthy lifestyle is much easier if you have the assistance of the world’s leading instructors. If you already own a Peloton bike or tread, then you can enjoy all the benefits of the Peloton app for free. Yoga, cardio or indoor cycling are just a few among numerous types of classes you can attend through this Android app. In addition, you can also broadcast your workouts through the Peloton’s Chromecast support and share your daily workout routines with thousands of followers. Even so, the app’s interface is somewhat outdated and the app crashes easily during workouts, which makes using Peloton frequently a bit difficult.

### 2\. [21 Buttons](https://play.google.com/store/apps/details?id=com.android21buttons&hl=en)

**Price:**Free

**Supported OS:**Requires Android 5.0 or up

**Category:**Social

![ 
21 Buttons: Fashion Social Network & Clothing Shop](https://images.wondershare.com/filmora/article-images/21-buttons-fashion-social-network-clothing-shop-app.jpg)

If you would like to keep track of the latest fashion trends and discover places where you can buy clothes and accessories worn by your favorite influencers, then you should install the 21 Buttons app on your phone. This social network for fashion enthusiasts can help you choose new outfits and save them in your public or private closets. What’s more, you can share the fashion choices with your followers and link to the stores where particular items can be purchased. This app also enables you to search for up and coming brands, since it is hard to find a fashion brand that isn’t featured on 21 Buttons.

### 3\. [Post-it®](https://play.google.com/store/apps/details?id=com.mmm.postit&hl=en)

**Price:**Free

**Supported OS:**Android 7.0 and up

**Category:**Productivity

![Most popular apps on Google Play - Post-it](https://images.wondershare.com/filmora/article-images/post-it-app-for-android.jpg)

Managing and organizing vast amounts of handwritten notes is a futile effort as sorting out hundreds of tiny pieces of paper is often impossible. Installing the Post-it app that captures handwritten notes and allows you to organize them in any way you want can help you perform your daily tasks more efficiently. Once you’ve created and organized your board you can share it with your colleagues or export it to Excel, PowerPoint or Trello. Post-it can capture more than 200 notes at the same time using your phone’s camera and use the Handwriting Recognition AI to transcribe them. Each not you create with this app can be easily edited or deleted.

### 4\. [Scripts by Drops – Learn to Write](https://play.google.com/store/apps/details?id=com.languagedrops.drops.scrips.learn.write.alphabet.letters.characters.language.japanese.korean.chinese&hl=en)

Learning a new language should be a fun process that is not going to take too much of your time. Scripts by Drops limits the total amount of time you can spend practicing a new language to just five minutes a day. Even though this may seem far from enough to master Chinese Hanzi or to learn Russian Cyrillic, this app will deliver the results you’re looking for as long as you keep using it every single day. Scripts by Drops employs visual learning techniques that help the app’s users connect letters and characters to their pronunciations. If you opt for one of the available subscription models you will have an unlimited amount of learning time at your disposal.
