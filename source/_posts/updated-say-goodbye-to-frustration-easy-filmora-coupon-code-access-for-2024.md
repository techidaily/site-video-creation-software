Developed by Apple, iMovie is one of the most popular video editing software on Mac. Free as VirtualDub, iMovie can conduct basic video editing and offer limited transitions and filters. If you only want to trim, [crop](https://tools.techidaily.com/wondershare/filmora/download/), split or [merge](https://tools.techidaily.com/wondershare/filmora/download/) video clips, iMovie is the one you can go after. If you are serious about video editing, it sure can not meet your needs.
