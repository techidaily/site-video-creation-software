![generated photos layout](https://images.wondershare.com/filmora/article-images/generated-photos-layout.jpg)

* Use the filters given in the left pane to define your character's physical attributes and click **Apply** from the bottom to get the results. You can customize the face from its head post, gender, age, hair, eye, and emotion aspects.
* Click your preferred character from the AI-generated faces, and then click **Download** from the page that opens next. Choose your preferred method to sign up, and then sign in to download the virtual face to your PC.

### 2\. Generated Photos: Anonymizer

**Website**: <https://generated.photos/anonymizer>

Anonymizer is another section from the Generated Photos portal that allows you to upload your image. Then it uses AI technology to generate similar virtual faces that you can download and use wherever needed.

However, sometimes the pictures that the website creates may not resemble your face as closely as you expect them to be, but that’s OK. Isn’t it? The main idea is to keep your privacy intact, and that’s what Generated Photos: Anonymizer does.

You can learn how to use this section by following the instructions given below:

* Use the URL given above to get to the Anonymizer’s web page and then click **Upload photo;**
* Select and upload your photo from your PC to the portal and wait while Anonymizer uses AI to generate similar faces.
* Click the photo that you want to use, and when the next page opens up, click Sign up or sign in to download the photo and use it wherever needed

### 3\. Generated Photos Face Generator

Website: [](https://generated.photos/face-generator)<https://generated.photos/face-generator>

This online face generator from Generated Photos allows you to create a unique realt-time face from scratch in one click. And if you don’t like the face generated, you can change the parameters such as gender, skin tone, hair, eye and head pose.

Generated Photos Face Generator tool is a good choice for people who don’t want to upload any photos online, and need to customize the face at maximum.

Below is a brief tutorial about how to generate a face with it step by step:

* Go to the website give above and then click the **Generate faces**
* Select the parameters accordingly based on your needs. You can generate the same face young or old with different emotions.

![generated photos face generator online](https://images.wondershare.com/filmora/article-images/generated-photos-face-generator-online.jpg)

You can then download the generated photo by signing up or logging in, but you need to pay to remove the watermark.

### 4\. Massless

**Website:** [https://massless.io/tool/face-maker-ai](https://massless.io/tool/face-maker-ai/)

Massless allows you to use its tools to sketch a portrait, and then it uses AI technology to generate a virtual face out of your drawing. However, because you can’t always be precise while sketching with the mouse, it would be good to have access to a digital drawing pad to create the faces with a pen. With Massless, you can explore your creativity to the full and draw beautiful faces to use them as your avatar.

You can follow the procedure given below to use Massless to draw virtual faces:

* Open a web browser, and visit the URL given above. Click any icons from the toolbox at the top (E.g., **Nose**).
* Draw a shape on its corresponding face area on the left (E.g., **Nose**), and wait while the portal automatically updates the photo on the right.
* Repeat the process to sketch other parts of the face, and click the More icon (with three vertical dots) from the top-right corner.
* Click **Download images** from the page that opens next to download the photo to your PC and use it wherever needed.

![massless online face generator](https://images.wondershare.com/filmora/article-images/massless-online-face-generator.jpg)

### 5\. This Person Does Not Exist

**Website:** <https://thispersondoesnotexist.com/>

This free online virtual face generator is probably the easiest and quickest. As you go to the website, it displays a random realistic image of a person that may not exist. If you don’t like the idea, you can change it with merely a single mouse click. Because the portal doesn’t have any Download button at the time of this writing, you must rely on the web browser’s default downloading process to get the image to your PC.

You can follow the instructions that are given below to switch between the images and download the one you like:

* Use your preferred web browser (Google Chrome here) to visit the URL provided above, and then notice the random image that appears on the page;
* Click **Another** from the box that appears at the bottom-right corner to change the image, repeat this process until you find a good photo for your avatar, and then right-click anywhere on the image.
* Click **Save image** from the context menu to save the photo. And then go to the default download folder to access the downloaded image, and use the picture wherever needed.

**Note:** Different browsers may have this feature with other names

![thispersondoesnotexist free online face generators](https://images.wondershare.com/filmora/article-images/thispersondoesnotexist-free-online-face-generators.jpg)

### 6\. BoredHumans

**Website**: <https://boredhumans.com/faces.php>

This web portal is identical to the previous one as it generates random virtual faces with merely one mouse click. Even this website doesn’t have any Download button to help you download the image. Therefore, you must use the browser’s built-in feature to obtain the photo you want to save to your PC.

You can learn how to use BoredHumans to generate virtual faces and download them to your computer by following the steps given below:

* Open a web browser (Google Chrome here) and visit the URL provided above, and then click **Generate Another Fake Human** if you don’t like the one that appears;
* Keep clicking the button until you find a face that can be used as your avatar. Alternatively, you can click the **Generate A Human** button to create a less realistic image of a random person.

![free online face generators boredhumans](https://images.wondershare.com/filmora/article-images/free-online-face-generators-boredhumans.jpg)

* Right-click the image and click **Save image** to download the photo to your PC; and then get to the default download location to access the photo and use it wherever needed.

### 7\. faceMaker

**Website**: <https://facemaker.uvrg.org/>

faceMaker allows you to generate virtual faces out of the fine details that you specify during the creation process. These details are adjusted using the sliders that affect the corresponding physical attributes of the avatars. For example, you can modify the lips, eye color, hair, face roundness, mouse depth, jaw shape, etc. using their respective sliders.

You can follow the steps that are given below to learn how to create a virtual face using faceMaker, and save it to your PC to use it as an avatar:

* Use your preferred web browser to visit the URL given above and click **Start** from the main page.
* Fill out the questionnaire by choosing your preferred options and agreeing to the term and conditions.
* Click **Start** and then click **Continue** on the next page. Use the sliders on the left and right panels to customize the face as needed, and once done, you can use any screen capturing tool to take a snapshot and remove the sliders by cropping the image, thus having only the virtual face.

![free online face generators facemaker](https://images.wondershare.com/filmora/article-images/free-online-face-generators-facemaker.jpg)

* Save the cropped photo on your PC, and then back on the webpage, click **Finished** from the bottom-right corner.

![facemaker online face generators face](https://images.wondershare.com/filmora/article-images/facemaker-online-face-generators-face.jpg)

* On the next page, choose the radio buttons according to your choice. Once done, click **Yes, submit now** from the bottom to submit the customized virtual face to the portal.

![download facemaker online face generators face](https://images.wondershare.com/filmora/article-images/download-facemaker-online-face-generators-face.jpg)

**Conclusion**

With all the cybercrime reports circulating everywhere nowadays, it is important to stay cautious about what you post on any social media website. To add an extra layer of security, you can avoid using your real photograph as a profile picture, and go with the fake faces instead. You can generate these virtual faces using any of the free online face generator websites, some of which even allow you to define the shape of a face quite minutely. Because the generated faces are not of any real human, they can be used as your avatar without any risk.

# Troubleshooting Tips for Final Cut Pro X

![author avatar](https://images.wondershare.com/filmora/article-images/benjamin-arango-author.jpg)

##### Benjamin Arango

 Mar 27, 2024• Proven solutions

Most of the time, Final Cut Pro X works great. But, when it doesn't, here are some things you can try to get your system back to normal in no time.

Here's the quick list:

* [Quit and restart Final Cut Pro](#part1)
* [Check your media](#part2)
* [Delete render files and re-render](#part3)
* [Create a new library](#part4)
* [Create a new user account](#part5)
* [Trash FCP X Preferences](#part6)
* [Remove and re-install Final Cut Pro](#part7)

#### 1 Quit and restart Final Cut Pro

Restarting Final Cut releases and refreshes memory so that if something was confusing your system, restarting Final Cut can fix it.

![restart fcp](https://images.wondershare.com/images/multimedia/video-editor/restart.png "restart fcp")

#### 2 Check your media

![check your media](https://images.wondershare.com/images/multimedia/video-editor/image-size.png "check your media")

Frequently, problems are caused by still images that are too big. Limit your digital photos to no more than 5,000 pixels on a side. Final Cut is a video editor, not a still image editor. Images that are too large cause problems.

Also, stock footage files are known to cause problems. Be sure to convert all stock footage to ProRes 422 before importing into Final Cut Pro X.

#### 3 Delete render files and re-render

Open your Project in the Timeline and choose File > Delete Project Render Files. Render files can become corrupt. Trashing them forces Final Cut to create new render files which often will fix the problem.

#### 4 Create a new library

Create a new library and a new project. Then, copy and paste sections of the old project into the new project. Test each section until you find the spot that doesn't work. At which point, you can remove or replace the bad media.

![Create a new library](https://images.wondershare.com/images/multimedia/video-editor/new-project.png "Create a new library")

#### 5 Create a new user account

![Create a new user account](https://images.wondershare.com/images/multimedia/video-editor/new-ccount.png "Create a new user account")

Open System Preferences > Accounts and create a new User Account. This resets all preferences for both Final Cut and the operating system back to factory defaults. The only problem with doing this is that a new user account can't access files stored in the Home directory of the old user account. For this reason, I always recommend storing all libraries on external hard drives, not the Home Directory.

#### 6 Trash FCP X Preferences

Trash Final Cut Pro X preference files. There are at least three preference files and, if you've had a crash, there can be more. Here are the steps:

* Go to the Finder.
* Hold down on the Option key and click on the Go menu. The Library folder inside your Home Directory now shows up as a selection inside this menu. (You could also type Shift+Command+G, or select Go > Go To Folder in the Finder; then, type \~/Library/ and click Go.)
* Open to the Library > Preferences folder.
* Trash com.apple.FinalCut.LSSharedFileList.plist
* Trash com.apple.FinalCut.plist
* Trash com.apple.FinalCut.UserDestinations.plist
* Trash any other files that start with "com.apple.finalcut".
* Empty the Trash.
* Restart Final Cut Pro X.

#### 7 Remove and reinstall Final Cut Pro

If all else fails, delete FCPX from the Applications folder and re-install it from the [Mac App Store](https://itunes.apple.com/us/app/final-cut-pro/id424389933?mt=12).

One of these techniques should fix your problem. If not, it's time to contact [Apple Support](http://www.apple.com/support/).

**\# Recommendation:**

This is a basic tutorial about Apple Final Cut Pro X, professional video editing software. However, if video editing is new to you, consider [Wondershare Filmora for Mac](https://tools.techidaily.com/wondershare/filmora/download/). This is a powerful but easy-to-use tool for users just starting out. Download the free trial version below.

![Installation3](https://images.wondershare.com/multimedia/installation3.png)

#### 2\. Importing Video

The next step is importing video. This can be done in two ways, by clicking the file folder icon at the top left you open a standard file browser to navigate to, and select your chosen video file, or alternatively you can simply drag you video into the main panel to import it.

![Importing Video1](https://images.wondershare.com/multimedia/importing-video1.png)

Whichever route you take, you will end up with your video file loaded in like this.

![Importing Video2](https://images.wondershare.com/multimedia/importing-video2.png)

Now you can edit the video as you need, Avidemux contains a wealth of features to enable the full spectrum of editing tasks to be completed. However, here we are going to look at the cropping tool, so on to the next step.

#### 3\. Editing Video

Avidemux has some idiosyncrasies in terms of operation, one of those is that to be able to edit any video, you have to choose your output format. Don’t worry though, this is easy, just use the dropdown at the side to choose the output format you want as can be seen here.

![Editing Video](https://images.wondershare.com/multimedia/editing-video.png)

Once that is set you are free to start editing your footage.

#### 4\. Cropping

It is important to understand how the editing process works in Avidemux, everything is accessed via the filters menu Video>Filters and from here you are faced with a new interface that enables you to choose the component you wish to use.

![Cropping1](https://images.wondershare.com/multimedia/cropping.png)

Selecting ‘Crop’ from the menu and pressing the green plus symbol at the bottom activated the crop tool and presents you with yet another view that allows you to adjust the crop to your tastes.

![Cropping2](https://images.wondershare.com/multimedia/cropping2.png)

#### 5\. Cropping controls

There are two options for cropping, you can use the Auto crop feature, which will detect any black lines and crop the footage between them, or if you are using the crop tool for something else, or just want to do it manually, you can set the crop via the left right top and bottom boxes. Values input here are the number of pixels from that edge the crop extends, as you are setting it, this is displayed with a green block signifying the area of the image that will be removed.

![Cropping controls1](https://images.wondershare.com/multimedia/cropping-controls1.png)

You can adjust this independently for all 4 edges as you wish.

![Cropping controls2](https://images.wondershare.com/multimedia/cropping-controls2.png)

Once you are happy with the crop, you click Ok and it takes you back to the familiar filter menu where you can use other components to perform more editing if you need.

#### 6\. Saving the crop

One of the most common points of confusion with Avidemux comes at this point, as your video will look no different to when you started, and many think they have done something wrong, but this is another part of Avidemux workflow. These filters can only be applied when the video is reencoded, and you do that through the file>save menu.

![Saving the crop1](https://images.wondershare.com/multimedia/saving-the-crop1.png)

Selecting this presents the familiar export dialogue and allows you to choose the name and destination of the file. Once that is done you click OK and you will see Avidemux processing your file and re-rendering it in this dialogue box.

![Saving the crop2](https://images.wondershare.com/multimedia/saving-the-crop2.png)

How long it takes will depend on a few factors, how many other effects have been added, how fast a processor your computer has, and how large and what resolution the video is. Format also plays a part in the process too, with some formats taking less time to encode than others. Once it has finished, you can view your video and see the crop in action.

As we can see, although there are a few aspects of the workflow that are a little unintuitive, cropping video in Avidemux is a straightforward process that anyone can accomplish with a bit of patience.

One of the key things to remember with Avidemux is that you apply all of your filters before re-encoding, this again is a question of patience and a bit of organization to ensure everything you wish to do is completed in order.

Avidemux is a great piece of software, it lacks the polish of some of its commercial rivals of course, but behind the sometimes clunky interface there is a very broad range of features that allow you to accomplish more or less any editing task you may want. In terms of free programs this is about as good as it gets, and the output is, without a doubt, great quality. For anyone looking for a free solution to video editing problems, and who do not mind a learning process Avidemux provides a useful tool.
