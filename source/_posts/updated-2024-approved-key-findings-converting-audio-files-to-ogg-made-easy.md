### 01What Does OGG Means?

OGG is a file format that was developed by the Xiph Foundation, specifically for encoding audio and video file types. It is freely available and open-source. This format can be used by anyone with the right skills and knowledge. Additionally, file formats like this can contain not only the audio data but also video, text (like subtitles), and metadata related to the audio. It is a credit to the word 'Jargon,' which is slang for slang used on the computer game Netrek.

### 02Is OGG Better Than MP3?

OGG (or Open Source Graphics) is a popular audio file format. These are often preferred over MP3 as the files are easily readable and can have equal quality thru conversions. For better understanding, let's have a look at other related details for both MP3 and OGG:-

**●** Both OGG & MP3 are compressed formats, but they have distinct differences. OGG files are smaller and less lossy, you will get higher quality with OGG files, and sometimes you can hear the difference even under close-to-same levels of compression.

**●** OGG is a file format that can only be developed by resource-rich companies. But it has huge benefits, such as being free, open, and owned by the public.

**●** OGG is an audio codec that uses a variable bit rate, which enables it to preserve bandwidth.

**●** MP3 is right up there with other formats when it comes to quality and size, but the OGG format compresses files into smaller sizes and maintains a better quality than the MP3 file.

**●** OGG files have a bit rate of several hundred Kbps, whereas MP3 format only reaches up to 320 Kbps. The difference, however, should not be too big of a concern.

01 [What is OGG?](#Part 1)

02 [Eight Online and Free OGG to MP4 Converter](#Part 2)

## Part 1 What is OGG?

### 01What Does OGG Means?

OGG is a file format that was developed by the Xiph Foundation, specifically for encoding audio and video file types. It is freely available and open-source. This format can be used by anyone with the right skills and knowledge. Additionally, file formats like this can contain not only the audio data but also video, text (like subtitles), and metadata related to the audio. It is a credit to the word 'Jargon,' which is slang for slang used on the computer game Netrek.

### 02Is OGG Better Than MP3?

OGG (or Open Source Graphics) is a popular audio file format. These are often preferred over MP3 as the files are easily readable and can have equal quality thru conversions. For better understanding, let's have a look at other related details for both MP3 and OGG:-

**●** Both OGG & MP3 are compressed formats, but they have distinct differences. OGG files are smaller and less lossy, you will get higher quality with OGG files, and sometimes you can hear the difference even under close-to-same levels of compression.

**●** OGG is a file format that can only be developed by resource-rich companies. But it has huge benefits, such as being free, open, and owned by the public.

**●** OGG is an audio codec that uses a variable bit rate, which enables it to preserve bandwidth.

**●** MP3 is right up there with other formats when it comes to quality and size, but the OGG format compresses files into smaller sizes and maintains a better quality than the MP3 file.

**●** OGG files have a bit rate of several hundred Kbps, whereas MP3 format only reaches up to 320 Kbps. The difference, however, should not be too big of a concern.

### 03How to Play OGG Files?

When you are looking forward to playing the OGG files, it is important to convert them. Most devices available do not support the file format, due to which you cannot play them directly. Maybe the operating system at which you are using the device may support it but if it is not, look out for converter tools.

### 04Which Other Formats OGG Can Be Converted into and Why

Different formats are available in which you can convert OGG like MP4, WEBM and AVI and so on. The reason behind doing the conversion is that devices do not allow users to play the content directly due to the lack of features in them.

In order to do so, you have to follow the steps mentioned below.

[![Download Filmora X Win Version](https://images.wondershare.com/filmora/guide/download-btn-win.jpg) ](https://tools.techidaily.com/wondershare/filmora/download/) [![Download Filmora X Mac Version](https://images.wondershare.com/filmora/guide/download-btn-mac.jpg) ](https://tools.techidaily.com/wondershare/filmora/download/)

![ add sound effects ](https://images.wondershare.com/filmora/guide/select-theme-music.jpg)

* The titles tab provides hundreds of titles and texts templates, including openers, titles, Lower 3rds, subtitles, and end credits. You can also use the Plain text template without animations and add some callouts.
* In the next step, add overlays or [transitions in your video](https://tools.techidaily.com/wondershare/filmora/download/), and if you have finished the editing, press Ctrl+S to save the project.

![ add transitions ](https://images.wondershare.com/filmora/guide/filters-filmora-win.jpg)

* Finally, click on the "Export" button and select the "Local" tab. Choose a name and file format for your video and tap "Export."

![save your video](https://images.wondershare.com/filmora/guide/go-to-export-panel.jpg)

## Part 2: Most Easy and Creative Features in Filmora (You Should Definitely Try)

Now you have the **Filmora free** version on your device. That means that you have now successfully gained access to multiple features of Wondershare Filmora for free.

Users generally do not have an idea of how to make the most out of their tool. Here, we have mentioned some of the fun and easy-to-use features offered by Filmora that you should definitely try as an aspiring content creator.

### 1. Filmora Green Screen

The Green Screen effect by Filmora is an advanced feature of the Overlays option. It enables users to combine two overlaid clips in such a way that the background of the lower layer can be visible on the top layer. It uses a color range in the top clip to make it shine through. You can get this effect by using a green background while shooting videos.

[![Download Filmora X Win Version](https://images.wondershare.com/filmora/guide/download-btn-win.jpg) ](https://tools.techidaily.com/wondershare/filmora/download/) [![Download Filmora X Mac Version](https://images.wondershare.com/filmora/guide/download-btn-mac.jpg) ](https://tools.techidaily.com/wondershare/filmora/download/)

### 2. Filmora Split Screen

The Split Screen feature in Wondershare Filmora allows you to display multiple clips on the screen at the same time. This feature comes in handy when you want to compare different angled shots or add two or more clips to your video. The effect helps users to add a specific style and class into your video.

Filmora currently offers around 30 split screen templates. You can add up to 6 different video clips in these presets at the same time. The default duration of the split screen is 5 seconds, but you can adjust it according to your requirements. You can add all kinds of borders, do a color correction, tuning and apply motion effects on your split-screen.

### 3. Filmora Beat Detection

**[Wondershare Filmora Video Editor](https://tools.techidaily.com/wondershare/filmora/download/)** offers a Beat Detection option for users, which marks audio beats from the inserted sound clip in your video automatically. The tool makes it easy to match your edits with the music, allowing a smooth clip. Analyzing and detecting the beats is entirely automatic.

It is an excellent tool for filming, even for people who are first-timers. You can change the highlight beat frequency, offset or add transitions in your beats. This will allow your videos to appear more in-sync and vivid.
