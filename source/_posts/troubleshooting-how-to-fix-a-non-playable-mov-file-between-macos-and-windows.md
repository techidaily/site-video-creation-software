## Possible 3 Reasons to MOV Won't Play Problem:

• **Player software not supporting codecs contained in MOV**: some players like QuickTime only supports MOV file encoded with MPEG-4 or H.264 video and AAC audio. If a H265 codec is contained, the player won't open MOV as a result. Therefore, QuickTime won't play MOV can be easily understood. In this case, one can simply convert the video codec into general supported h.264 ACC or install additional codec packs or just change a media player instead. Usually problems like .mov won't play in VLC, won't play on PC Windows, won't play on Mac iPhone Android can be categorized under this major reason.

For specific guide on codec pack for each player you can refer to MPC codec pack guide, VLC codec pack download guide and windows media player codec guide respectively.   
Codec conversion is another way to solve the problem directly but also requiring extra assistant from converters like WinX video converter or MacX converter. What 5KPlayer can do here is limited to you convert file to MP3 instantly if that is your aim.
