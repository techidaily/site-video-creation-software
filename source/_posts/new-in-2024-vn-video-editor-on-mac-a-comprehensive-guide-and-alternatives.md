### 02Is OGG Better Than MP3?

OGG (or Open Source Graphics) is a popular audio file format. These are often preferred over MP3 as the files are easily readable and can have equal quality thru conversions. For better understanding, let's have a look at other related details for both MP3 and OGG:-

**●** Both OGG & MP3 are compressed formats, but they have distinct differences. OGG files are smaller and less lossy, you will get higher quality with OGG files, and sometimes you can hear the difference even under close-to-same levels of compression.

**●** OGG is a file format that can only be developed by resource-rich companies. But it has huge benefits, such as being free, open, and owned by the public.

**●** OGG is an audio codec that uses a variable bit rate, which enables it to preserve bandwidth.

**●** MP3 is right up there with other formats when it comes to quality and size, but the OGG format compresses files into smaller sizes and maintains a better quality than the MP3 file.

**●** OGG files have a bit rate of several hundred Kbps, whereas MP3 format only reaches up to 320 Kbps. The difference, however, should not be too big of a concern.

### 03How to Play OGG Files?

When you are looking forward to playing the OGG files, it is important to convert them. Most devices available do not support the file format, due to which you cannot play them directly. Maybe the operating system at which you are using the device may support it but if it is not, look out for converter tools.

Different formats are available in which you can convert OGG like MP4, WEBM and AVI and so on. The reason behind doing the conversion is that devices do not allow users to play the content directly due to the lack of features in them.

It not only serves the purpose of highlighting the focus of the image, but can also help when you’re looking to get rid of an unpleasant or unwanted background. The blurred background is meant to keep your focal point at the absolute center of your audience’s attention.

The blurred background is meant to keep your focal point at the absolute center of your audience’s attention.

To create the Bokeh effect in Tadaa SLR:

2. Once image is imported, select the **Mask** tool, which you can use to select the portion of the image you’d like to keep in focus;
3. You may then adjust the aperture, range, gloss and highlights via the modification tools provided at the bottom of the screen.
4. Adjust to your liking and export!

## Part 3: Creating the Bokeh Effect Using the Portrait Mode Function on Your iPhone

If using a third-party app seems like too much effort, or you don’t find the app that achieves the exact blur to focus ratio you’re looking for, consider using the Portrait Mode feature available on newer iPhone models.

Portrait mode is a camera function that allows users to create the depth of field effect we know as Bokeh. When used, the focal image will be crisp and sharp, while the background will be blurred nicely so as to not cause a distraction to the focal point.

To achieve the Bokeh effect through Portrait Mode, you must:

1. Open up your camera app and along the bottom of your screen find and select **Portrait**, and select from a variety of portrait mode options, including Natural light, studio light, contour light, stage light, stage light mono, high key light mono;

![add bokeh effects with Portrait Mode on iPhone](https://images.wondershare.com/filmora/article-images/iphone-portrait-mode-option.jpg)

1. Portrait mode will then allow you to choose your focal point, and do the rest of the work when it comes to blurring the background to create the Bokeh effect;
2. The different modes offered will allow users to achieve different types of blur.

Note: If you want to add the bokeh effect to video on the desktop computer, you should try [Wondershare Filmora](https://tools.techidaily.com/wondershare/filmora/download/), which provides tilt-shift circle and tilt-shift linear effects for creating the bokeh effect, as well as some bokeh effect overlay. For more details, you can check [how to add bokeh effects to the video](https://tools.techidaily.com/wondershare/filmora/download/) with Filmora.

**Takeaway**

Using the Bokeh effect can add a layer to your photography that takes it to the next level. While there are a variety of tools you can use to achieve this, I have covered the 10 best apps for iOS and Android users to accomplish Bokeh. And if third-party apps aren’t for you, don’t forget that iPhone user can also use Portrait Mode to achieve a great Bokeh outcome.
