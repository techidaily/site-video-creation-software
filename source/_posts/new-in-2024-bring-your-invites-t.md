## Top 10 Best Free Video Editors for Ubuntu

Picking the right video editor might be difficult for some people, but that's where FOSS Ubuntu comes in. We've gathered a list of the finest **video editors for Ubuntu** for your benefit. We have tried and tested these apps. And based on our experience, we recomend:

| [1 - OpenShot](#1)  | [2 - OBS Studio](#2) | [3 - PiTiVi](#3)          | [4 - Kdenlive](#4) |
| ------------------- | -------------------- | ------------------------- | ------------------ |
| [5 - Shotcut](#5)   | [6 - Lightworks](#6) | [7 - HitFilm Express](#7) | [8 - VLC](#8)      |
| [9 - Cinelerra](#9) | [10 - Blender](#10)  | [](#)                    | [ ](#)             |

### 1\. [OpenShot](https://www.openshot.org/)

We are confident that you will not find a more user-friendly video editor than this one. OpenShot is most likely the best choice when you're new to video production. It is simple to use, but it also has several interesting features.

This editor comes with a plethora of titles and transitions and compatibility for the majority of video and picture formats. You also receive an excellent export option that allows you to save files in various formats. As already mentioned, the application is designed to meet the needs of beginning learners; yet, advanced users will not be dissatisfied because it supports high-quality video formats such as 4K.

OpenShot has several useful audio editing capabilities, including seeing waveforms on the timeline and even displaying the waveform as part of the film. It also allows you to [separate the sound from the video clip](https://tools.techidaily.com/wondershare/filmora/download/) and tune each sound channel separately.

### 2\. [OBS Studio](https://obsproject.com/)

OBS Studio is a free, open-source tool that can be downloaded and installed on Ubuntu and other operating systems such as Windows and Mac. Because it includes a fantastic [screen capturer](https://tools.techidaily.com/wondershare/filmora/download/), OBS Studio is becoming famous for making videos of Ubuntu or other computer programs. OBS Studio is a basic video editor that lets us blend photos, movies, and music easily.

OBS Studio can create movies in the following formats: Flv, Mkv, mp4, mov, ts, and m3u8\. Although the formats are not very open, they are compatible with internet video publishing sites. This editor allows us to modify video rather than merely broadcast it, albeit the editing functionality is not as robust as Kdenlive or Openshot.

OBS Studio also links with video streaming sites to create live videos, unlike other video editing software. This has made it a highly popular software among YouTubers and one that we can download on any Ubuntu version.

### 3\. [PiTiVi](https://www.pitivi.org/)

Like many others, this one lets you perform basic video editing activities such as trimming, cutting, snapping, splitting, and mixing. The program also supports several additional languages for those who aren't fluent in English. You should probably read the manual before using it since it contains a lot of valuable information on using this application.

In a word, the application provides a touch-capable, hardware-accelerated user experience. Limitless video/audio track layers, full undo/redo history, trimming, cutting, sound editing of several concurrent audio layers upon layer, volume keyframe curves, keyframe audio enhancements, and more are all supported.

Pitivi creates thumbnails and waveforms in the background to provide you with the best performance without interfering with your workflow. Pitivi may be found in most Ubuntu software repositories. If you want, you may also download pre-assembled kits.

### 4\. [Kdenlive](https://kdenlive.org/en/)

Kdenlive is, without a doubt, one of the best video editing applications for Ubuntu available right now! What sets it apart from other video editors is that it is completely free and includes several useful features. The MLT Framework, which is based on many other open-source projects, handles most of the video editing in Kdenlive, built on Qt and the KDE Frameworks libraries.

Adjustable layout compatibility, a clip list, a multitrack chronology, automatic backup, keyframe special effects, and transitioning are all included in this video editing program. Do you have a special file format or camcorder? Not an issue — Kdenlive works with practically anything.

It's also worth noting that Kdenlive runs on Mac OSX and FreeBSD. Proxy editing is another useful function. This handy function can produce low-quality duplicates of your source clips for quick editing and render them in full resolution.

### 5\. [Shotcut](https://shotcut.org/)

Another free, open-source, and cross-platform video editor is Shotcut. Unlike Kdenlive, beginner video editors would obtain a comprehensive understanding of Shotcut because of its user-friendly interface. It has indigenous timeline editing, video transitions and filters, and a multitrack timeline, among other things.

Keyframes for digital filters and 3-point editing are supported.

Furthermore, it allows for external monitoring.

JACK transport sync, audio blending throughout all channels, stereo, mono, and 5.1 surround sound capabilities are supported on the audio front. Shotcut is considered ideal for beginners, and if you are one, we would highly suggest getting this one for your Ubuntu.

### 6\. [Lightworks](https://lwks.com/)

Because the functions go beyond the world of inexperienced editors, this video editor for Ubuntu computers is suited for specialists in video editing. The award-winning non-linear editing (NLE) program can handle 4K, Blu-Ray, and even SD and HD footage. You'll also discover Low-Res [Proxy workflows](https://tools.techidaily.com/wondershare/filmora/download/) for 4K and drag-and-drop support alongside those capabilities.

### 7\. [HitFilm Express](https://fxhome.com/product/hitfilm-express)

Check out HitFilm Express from FXhome when you seek the greatest video editing software but don't want to spend a lot of money. This [free video editor](https://tools.techidaily.com/wondershare/filmora/download/) offers most of the same capabilities as top-tier production suites, featuring 4K video capability, 360-degree editing, and hundreds of special effects.

In reality, when it comes to editing capabilities, Hitfilm Express is extremely similar to Adobe Premiere Pro.

The major disadvantage of this program is that it consumes a lot of system resources, which means it won't run on many lightweight laptops. You'll have to pay extra for things like [360-degree](https://tools.techidaily.com/wondershare/filmora/download/) text, extra color grading facilities, and other aesthetic enhancements, among other things. Hitfilm Express is a video editor that is so strong and simple to use that it's difficult to believe it's free. It's a great option for any video creator on a shoestring budget.

### 8\. [VLC](https://www.videolan.org/vlc/)

### 9\. [Cinelerra](http://cinelerra.org/)

Cinelerra is a video editor for GNU/Ubuntu, first released in 1998\. It was the first non-linear video editor for GNU/Ubuntu that was functional with 64-bit platforms. Cinelerra was a huge hit in its early years since it was a comprehensive and free video editor that was practically unique in its field. However, as time went on, progress slowed, and many users abandoned the project.

Currently, work is ongoing, and new Ubuntu versions are being released in stages. Cinelerra includes a split editing panel that, like Gimp, allows for non-linear video editing. Like all other video editors, Cinelerra provides a variety of video effects and transitions for producing movies and slideshows. We can get Cinelerra from Sourceforge; once we install it, we should run the program using the./ command.

### 10\. [Blender](https://www.blender.org/)

Like Lightworks and KDenlive, this video editor is geared towards advanced users, but the greatest part is that it is free. It focuses on 3D animation rather than traditional video editing. It's widely used in 3D modeling, visual effects, animation, simulation, pipeline, and game development.

Blender has filters, transitions, [keyframes](https://tools.techidaily.com/wondershare/filmora/download/), adjustment layers, speed control, live preview, histogram displays, luma waveform, and chroma vectorscope for video production. Aside from that, it also allows you to mix, sync, and scrub audio files.

Because all of these functions might be a steep learning curve, it is a little challenging for inexperienced video producers. It is, without a doubt, the finest example of a free and open-source community project. Blender is a free program found in practically any software app store.

**Conclusion**

Well, there you have it – your best **Ubuntu Video Editor** tools list. Using Ubuntu does not preclude you from installing high-quality apps. Except for the [video editors](https://tools.techidaily.com/wondershare/filmora/download/) described above, there are many other Ubuntu applications available.

A few are geared for pros (such as Lightworks, HitFilm Express, and Blender), while others are designed for beginners (similar to Shotcut and OpenShot). Additionally, because most video editors are currently accessible on the google play store, you would be able to download and install them on your Ubuntu laptop.

### 9\. [Cinelerra](http://cinelerra.org/)

Cinelerra is a video editor for GNU/Ubuntu, first released in 1998\. It was the first non-linear video editor for GNU/Ubuntu that was functional with 64-bit platforms. Cinelerra was a huge hit in its early years since it was a comprehensive and free video editor that was practically unique in its field. However, as time went on, progress slowed, and many users abandoned the project.

Currently, work is ongoing, and new Ubuntu versions are being released in stages. Cinelerra includes a split editing panel that, like Gimp, allows for non-linear video editing. Like all other video editors, Cinelerra provides a variety of video effects and transitions for producing movies and slideshows. We can get Cinelerra from Sourceforge; once we install it, we should run the program using the./ command.

### 10\. [Blender](https://www.blender.org/)

Like Lightworks and KDenlive, this video editor is geared towards advanced users, but the greatest part is that it is free. It focuses on 3D animation rather than traditional video editing. It's widely used in 3D modeling, visual effects, animation, simulation, pipeline, and game development.

Blender has filters, transitions, [keyframes](https://tools.techidaily.com/wondershare/filmora/download/), adjustment layers, speed control, live preview, histogram displays, luma waveform, and chroma vectorscope for video production. Aside from that, it also allows you to mix, sync, and scrub audio files.

Because all of these functions might be a steep learning curve, it is a little challenging for inexperienced video producers. It is, without a doubt, the finest example of a free and open-source community project. Blender is a free program found in practically any software app store.

**Conclusion**

Well, there you have it – your best **Ubuntu Video Editor** tools list. Using Ubuntu does not preclude you from installing high-quality apps. Except for the [video editors](https://tools.techidaily.com/wondershare/filmora/download/) described above, there are many other Ubuntu applications available.

A few are geared for pros (such as Lightworks, HitFilm Express, and Blender), while others are designed for beginners (similar to Shotcut and OpenShot). Additionally, because most video editors are currently accessible on the google play store, you would be able to download and install them on your Ubuntu laptop.

## Top 10 Best Free Video Editors for Ubuntu

Picking the right video editor might be difficult for some people, but that's where FOSS Ubuntu comes in. We've gathered a list of the finest **video editors for Ubuntu** for your benefit. We have tried and tested these apps. And based on our experience, we recomend:

| [1 - OpenShot](#1)  | [2 - OBS Studio](#2) | [3 - PiTiVi](#3)          | [4 - Kdenlive](#4) |
| ------------------- | -------------------- | ------------------------- | ------------------ |
| [5 - Shotcut](#5)   | [6 - Lightworks](#6) | [7 - HitFilm Express](#7) | [8 - VLC](#8)      |
| [9 - Cinelerra](#9) | [10 - Blender](#10)  | [](#)                    | [ ](#)             |

### 1\. [OpenShot](https://www.openshot.org/)

We are confident that you will not find a more user-friendly video editor than this one. OpenShot is most likely the best choice when you're new to video production. It is simple to use, but it also has several interesting features.

This editor comes with a plethora of titles and transitions and compatibility for the majority of video and picture formats. You also receive an excellent export option that allows you to save files in various formats. As already mentioned, the application is designed to meet the needs of beginning learners; yet, advanced users will not be dissatisfied because it supports high-quality video formats such as 4K.

OpenShot has several useful audio editing capabilities, including seeing waveforms on the timeline and even displaying the waveform as part of the film. It also allows you to [separate the sound from the video clip](https://tools.techidaily.com/wondershare/filmora/download/) and tune each sound channel separately.

### 2\. [OBS Studio](https://obsproject.com/)

OBS Studio is a free, open-source tool that can be downloaded and installed on Ubuntu and other operating systems such as Windows and Mac. Because it includes a fantastic [screen capturer](https://tools.techidaily.com/wondershare/filmora/download/), OBS Studio is becoming famous for making videos of Ubuntu or other computer programs. OBS Studio is a basic video editor that lets us blend photos, movies, and music easily.

OBS Studio can create movies in the following formats: Flv, Mkv, mp4, mov, ts, and m3u8\. Although the formats are not very open, they are compatible with internet video publishing sites. This editor allows us to modify video rather than merely broadcast it, albeit the editing functionality is not as robust as Kdenlive or Openshot.

OBS Studio also links with video streaming sites to create live videos, unlike other video editing software. This has made it a highly popular software among YouTubers and one that we can download on any Ubuntu version.

### 3\. [PiTiVi](https://www.pitivi.org/)

Like many others, this one lets you perform basic video editing activities such as trimming, cutting, snapping, splitting, and mixing. The program also supports several additional languages for those who aren't fluent in English. You should probably read the manual before using it since it contains a lot of valuable information on using this application.

In a word, the application provides a touch-capable, hardware-accelerated user experience. Limitless video/audio track layers, full undo/redo history, trimming, cutting, sound editing of several concurrent audio layers upon layer, volume keyframe curves, keyframe audio enhancements, and more are all supported.

Pitivi creates thumbnails and waveforms in the background to provide you with the best performance without interfering with your workflow. Pitivi may be found in most Ubuntu software repositories. If you want, you may also download pre-assembled kits.

Kdenlive is, without a doubt, one of the best video editing applications for Ubuntu available right now! What sets it apart from other video editors is that it is completely free and includes several useful features. The MLT Framework, which is based on many other open-source projects, handles most of the video editing in Kdenlive, built on Qt and the KDE Frameworks libraries.

Adjustable layout compatibility, a clip list, a multitrack chronology, automatic backup, keyframe special effects, and transitioning are all included in this video editing program. Do you have a special file format or camcorder? Not an issue — Kdenlive works with practically anything.

It's also worth noting that Kdenlive runs on Mac OSX and FreeBSD. Proxy editing is another useful function. This handy function can produce low-quality duplicates of your source clips for quick editing and render them in full resolution.

### 5\. [Shotcut](https://shotcut.org/)

Another free, open-source, and cross-platform video editor is Shotcut. Unlike Kdenlive, beginner video editors would obtain a comprehensive understanding of Shotcut because of its user-friendly interface. It has indigenous timeline editing, video transitions and filters, and a multitrack timeline, among other things.

### 9\. [Cinelerra](http://cinelerra.org/)

Cinelerra is a video editor for GNU/Ubuntu, first released in 1998\. It was the first non-linear video editor for GNU/Ubuntu that was functional with 64-bit platforms. Cinelerra was a huge hit in its early years since it was a comprehensive and free video editor that was practically unique in its field. However, as time went on, progress slowed, and many users abandoned the project.

Currently, work is ongoing, and new Ubuntu versions are being released in stages. Cinelerra includes a split editing panel that, like Gimp, allows for non-linear video editing. Like all other video editors, Cinelerra provides a variety of video effects and transitions for producing movies and slideshows. We can get Cinelerra from Sourceforge; once we install it, we should run the program using the./ command.

### 10\. [Blender](https://www.blender.org/)

Like Lightworks and KDenlive, this video editor is geared towards advanced users, but the greatest part is that it is free. It focuses on 3D animation rather than traditional video editing. It's widely used in 3D modeling, visual effects, animation, simulation, pipeline, and game development.

Blender has filters, transitions, [keyframes](https://tools.techidaily.com/wondershare/filmora/download/), adjustment layers, speed control, live preview, histogram displays, luma waveform, and chroma vectorscope for video production. Aside from that, it also allows you to mix, sync, and scrub audio files.

Because all of these functions might be a steep learning curve, it is a little challenging for inexperienced video producers. It is, without a doubt, the finest example of a free and open-source community project. Blender is a free program found in practically any software app store.

**Conclusion**

Well, there you have it – your best **Ubuntu Video Editor** tools list. Using Ubuntu does not preclude you from installing high-quality apps. Except for the [video editors](https://tools.techidaily.com/wondershare/filmora/download/) described above, there are many other Ubuntu applications available.

A few are geared for pros (such as Lightworks, HitFilm Express, and Blender), while others are designed for beginners (similar to Shotcut and OpenShot). Additionally, because most video editors are currently accessible on the google play store, you would be able to download and install them on your Ubuntu laptop.
