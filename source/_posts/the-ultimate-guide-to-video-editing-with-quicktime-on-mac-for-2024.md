The Face Swap makes switching faces with your friends in real-time look easy because you just have to start recording a video, and the app will do all the work for you. What’s more, you can use this app to swap faces in photos, so you can become your favorite celebrity in just a few seconds. The [lite version](https://itunes.apple.com/in/app/face-swap-live-lite-switch/id1077478814?mt=8&ign-mpt=uo%3D8) of the app is also available if you don’t want to spend your money on this app until you’ve tried what it can do. However, the app’s file-sharing capabilities are far from perfect.

You can add your face over a single photo as many times as you want, swap faces across several photos, change faces with superstars, and much more if you decide to install this app on your Smartphone. The advanced face detection technology automatically switches the faces in all photos with utmost precision, so you can focus on discovering ways to make your images as entertaining as they can possibly be. The only downside is that you will have to upgrade to the premium version of the app in order to be able to use all of its features.
