## Part 1: What to Consider When Choosing an Online Video Editor

Each video editor listed below has its distinct features. Here are the factors to consider when choosing an online video editor.

#### 1. Pricing

Whereas some online video editors are absolutely free, to others payment is a must to access no watermark option. It may be financially draining to subscribe to a $49.99/month plan. Then, why not opt for the $9.99/month if you have to?

It’s critically important to weigh your financial strengths. However, the features included in the paid plans and the video purpose determine how much to spend.

#### 2. Features

The attractiveness and video theme are better actualized by the features you use. Can you spot “no watermark” indicated anywhere within the features? Whether your edited videos will show with editor labels or watermarks is determined by the online video editor’s features.

Choosing an online video editor with cloud-based storage full of royalty-free videos and templates helps save time and simplifies editing procedures.

#### 3. Ease of Use

Some online video editors are so complex that you’ve to tutorials and guides before starting to edit. You don't have to spend 2 hours editing a 10-minute video.

Before you can begin to use any video editor, consider evaluating the complexity of all features to use. How to import images and share edited videos to social media and websites should be given first priority during the evaluation process.

#### 4. Purpose of the Video

Creating and editing commercial videos require an online video editor with features designed with a business theme. You cannot choose an editor with watermarks and yet you are advertising a different product.

Tutorial videos are usually above 8 minutes and the voice should be as clear as possible. Some video editors and plans are limited to a 5-minute video.

## Part 1: What to Consider When Choosing an Online Video Editor

Each video editor listed below has its distinct features. Here are the factors to consider when choosing an online video editor.

#### 1. Pricing

Whereas some online video editors are absolutely free, to others payment is a must to access no watermark option. It may be financially draining to subscribe to a $49.99/month plan. Then, why not opt for the $9.99/month if you have to?

It’s critically important to weigh your financial strengths. However, the features included in the paid plans and the video purpose determine how much to spend.

#### 2. Features

The attractiveness and video theme are better actualized by the features you use. Can you spot “no watermark” indicated anywhere within the features? Whether your edited videos will show with editor labels or watermarks is determined by the online video editor’s features.

Choosing an online video editor with cloud-based storage full of royalty-free videos and templates helps save time and simplifies editing procedures.

#### 3. Ease of Use

Some online video editors are so complex that you’ve to tutorials and guides before starting to edit. You don't have to spend 2 hours editing a 10-minute video.

Before you can begin to use any video editor, consider evaluating the complexity of all features to use. How to import images and share edited videos to social media and websites should be given first priority during the evaluation process.

#### 4. Purpose of the Video

Creating and editing commercial videos require an online video editor with features designed with a business theme. You cannot choose an editor with watermarks and yet you are advertising a different product.

Tutorial videos are usually above 8 minutes and the voice should be as clear as possible. Some video editors and plans are limited to a 5-minute video.
