But of course, the resources are endless and in case we have some information, we can easily access the free video editing platforms which give us the opportunity to edit our videos without undesired logos on them. In this case, we will be discussing 6 video mergers without watermark, and the way we can use them – the tools and features they offer, and how we can get the best out of them.</p>
<ul>
<li><strong>Photos by Microsoft</strong></li>
</ul>
<p>If you are too lazy to get high-quality results using popular video editors, like Filmora, try Photos App. It is a built-in program that usually opens your images on Windows 10, but you can also use it for merging your videos. And guess what? Since it comes within the system, all the features, although limited, are absolutely free.</p>
<h3 id="How-to-Merge-Videos-on-Windows-using-Photos-App"><a href="#How-to-Merge-Videos-on-Windows-using-Photos-App" class="headerlink" title="How to Merge Videos on Windows using Photos App?"></a>How to Merge Videos on Windows using Photos App?</h3><p><img  
                     lazyload
                     src="/images/loading.svg"
                     data-src="https://images.wondershare.com/filmora/article-images/2023/03/merging-videos-photos-app.png"
                      alt="video-mergers-without-watermark.html"
                ></p>
<p>These are the steps to combine multiple clips in Windows 10 with Photos App.</p>
<p><strong>Step 1: Open Photos App</strong></p>
<p>Go to the ‘Start’ menu, find Photos App, and click to open it.</p>
<p><strong>Step 2: Make a New Project</strong></p>
<p>Click the ‘New video project’ (big blue box) under the ‘Video Projects’ tab. Alternatively, you can click the ‘New video’ button and select the ‘New video project’ option from the dropdown menu.</p>
<p><strong>Step 3: Add Clips</strong></p>
<p>Look for the text ‘Project library.’ Then click the ‘+ Add’ button. This will open a new window so you can select the clips you want to combine. Also, import videos one by one in a proper sequence because you cannot arrange them later.</p>
<p><strong>Step 4: Make a Storyboard</strong></p>
<p>After importing all the shots, you want to merge, click the ‘Place in storyboard’ button. This option will add all the chosen clips to your project’s storyboard.</p>
<ul>
<li><strong>Fastreel by Movavi</strong></li>
</ul>
<p><a class="link"   target="_blank" rel="noopener" href="https://www.fastreel.com/" >Fastreel <i class="fa-regular fa-arrow-up-right-from-square fa-sm"></i></a> is a free online video editor. It is extremely easy to use right away, without installing anything. So, on Fastreel, one can edit videos or use online templates in the browser itself. Actually, the first tool we see in the list of Fastreel tools is to merge a video; then, it can be used in order to compress, make, cut, and create a video. On fastreel, you can add a watermark to a video, if wanted - so, it is very voluntary. As for the merging of a video, when this tool is chosen, it’s pretty simple to understand the steps – you can just drop&#x2F;add multiple files right away.</p>
<p><img  
                     lazyload
                     src="/images/loading.svg"
                     data-src="https://images.wondershare.com/filmora/article-images/2022/01/video-mergers-without-watermark-1.jpg"
                      alt="video-mergers-without-watermark.html"
                ></p>
<p>The format must be either of the listed: MP4, MOV, MKV, AVI, and WMV, and the total size mustn’t exceed 500 MB. Then, in order to add some transitions, a style can be chosen from the drop-down menu, and after that, you should hit on Continue button to stitch the videos together. For the last step, you can export the result by selecting Download option.</p>
<p><img  
                     lazyload
                     src="/images/loading.svg"
                     data-src="https://images.wondershare.com/filmora/article-images/2022/01/video-mergers-without-watermark-2.jpg"
                      alt="video-mergers-without-watermark.html"
                ></p>
<ul>
<li><strong>Free Video Cutter Joiner</strong></li>
</ul>
<p><a class="link"   target="_blank" rel="noopener" href="https://www.freevideocutterjoiner.com/" >Free Video Cutter Joiner <i class="fa-regular fa-arrow-up-right-from-square fa-sm"></i></a> – the name already explains it all by itself! This is a free video merger which will not add watermark on your video. The software needs to be downloaded, and contributes to quickly cutting and joining videos. Free Video Cutter Joiner has no size limits – it can cut and merge videos with large file sizes without any trouble, and speed of it to do so is quite fast. It supports several file formats, such as AVI, MPEG, WMV, 3GP FLV, MP4, WMV, MOV, VOB, etc.</p>
<p>So, once downloaded, you will see how user-friendly and straightforward the software is: it shows two of its features right away – video cutter and video joiner. You choose which one you are about to use – so, in our case, video joiner.</p>
<p><img  
                     lazyload
                     src="/images/loading.svg"
                     data-src="https://images.wondershare.com/filmora/article-images/2022/01/video-mergers-without-watermark-3.jpg"
                      alt="video-mergers-without-watermark.html"
                ></p>
<p>Then, you should click the the “+” icon, which lets you add files from your PC.</p>
<p><img  
                     lazyload
                     src="/images/loading.svg"
                     data-src="https://images.wondershare.com/filmora/article-images/2022/01/video-mergers-without-watermark-4.jpg"
                      alt="video-mergers-without-watermark.html"
                ></p>
<p>Then, hit on the Join button, and choose Indirect Join. Hitting on Start Join will start merging all the uploaded videos, and, wait a little until the process has been completed.</p>
<p><img  
                     lazyload
                     src="/images/loading.svg"
                     data-src="https://images.wondershare.com/filmora/article-images/2022/01/video-mergers-without-watermark-5.jpg"
                      alt="video-mergers-without-watermark.html"
                ></p>
<ul>
<li><strong>Clideo</strong></li>
</ul>
<p><a class="link"   target="_blank" rel="noopener" href="https://clideo.com/" >Clideo <i class="fa-regular fa-arrow-up-right-from-square fa-sm"></i></a> is the online platform that declares that it makes it super easy to edit all your video files, images and GIFs, and is totally free. It gives us the opportunities to: merge, compress, resize, cut, make, crop, speed, rotate, add music to, loop, flip, reverse, mute, filter, and adjust the videos. Add subtitles, make memes, create slideshows, etc. Therefore, it’s pretty rich in its tools and features.</p>
<p>As for merging videos, much like Fastreel, Clideo is pretty straightforward. You just click on the mentioned tool, and then easily choose files you would like to combine – you can merge any amount of video clips there. Several files can be chosen at the same time, or they can be added one by one.</p>
<p><img  
                     lazyload
                     src="/images/loading.svg"
                     data-src="https://images.wondershare.com/filmora/article-images/2022/01/video-mergers-without-watermark-6.jpg"
                      alt="video-mergers-without-watermark.html"
                ></p>
<p>Then it will take you to the editor, where you can join the videos. It’s possible to rearrange the files, by using drag-and-drop until they’re in the desired order. You can also add images and set duration from them, add audio, change its length and volume. The last step is choosing the aspect ratio and clicking the Export button. You can watch the preview of your result and then click on Download if you are satisfied with the merged file.</p>
<p><img  
                     lazyload
                     src="/images/loading.svg"
                     data-src="https://images.wondershare.com/filmora/article-images/2022/01/video-mergers-without-watermark-7.jpg"
                      alt="video-mergers-without-watermark.html"
                ></p>
<ul>
<li><strong>Typito</strong></li>
</ul>
<p><a class="link"   target="_blank" rel="noopener" href="https://typito.com/" >Typito <i class="fa-regular fa-arrow-up-right-from-square fa-sm"></i></a> is a platform to merge videos online, as well as Fastreel and Clideo. It is free, and mostly aims to create combinations one can use to post on social network such as Instagram, Facebook, and Youtube. Typito supports a great many formats, some of them being MP4, AVI, FLV and WMV. You can edit your videos before merging them by trimming, cropping and resizing, and also add transition effects and music. It quickly combines footage, doesn’t watermark the videos, has brand kit of colors, fonts and style. It can also create collection of images, which is used for making Youtube compilation at most times.</p>
<p>To merge videos, you should choose the tool, then Get Started, and register and sign in first.</p>
<p><img  
                     lazyload
                     src="/images/loading.svg"
                     data-src="https://images.wondershare.com/filmora/article-images/2022/01/video-mergers-without-watermark-8.jpg"
                      alt="video-mergers-without-watermark.html"
                ></p>
<p>Then click on New Project, choose a video format (the platform offers you the list of the most popular ones), and it will take you to the editor, where you start off by adding media.</p>
<p><img  
                     lazyload
                     src="/images/loading.svg"
                     data-src="https://images.wondershare.com/filmora/article-images/2022/01/video-mergers-without-watermark-9.jpg"
                      alt="video-mergers-without-watermark.html"
                ></p>
<p>Drag and drop images or videos that you want to combine into a single video. You can also click to upload media files from your system or browse our Stock Media library for high-quality stock photos and video. Then, you can put your video clips in order, and work on it, if you want to use different tools, such as: edit, crop, trim, or resize them, as well as add text captions, images, and transitions. After you have previewed your video, you can click on the export button in the top right corner, and then, your merged video will be ready to be shared.</p>
<ul>
<li><strong>Online UniConverter</strong></li>
</ul>
<p>Online UniConverter is the next online platform giving us the chance to merge our videos without watermark. It is an online analogue of Wondershare UniConverter, and is a very powerful platform, where you can trim, split, rotate, adjust, and download videos in HD quality. UniConverter supports numerous video formats, including MP4, AVI, MOV, MP3, WEBM. Online UniConverter offers various transitions and aspect ratios to fit the screen.</p>
<p><img  
                     lazyload
                     src="/images/loading.svg"
                     data-src="https://images.wondershare.com/filmora/article-images/2022/01/video-mergers-without-watermark-10.jpg"
                      alt="video-mergers-without-watermark.html"
                ></p>
<p>The web-site has lots of tools and features to offer: in the description of it, it reads: video converter, video compressor, video editor, audio converter, audio compressor, audio cutter, GIF maker, YouTube thumbnail, and image resizer. Importing media to the online UniConverter is extremely easy, and combining videos turns out to be a quick process, too.</p>
<p><img  
                     lazyload
                     src="/images/loading.svg"
                     data-src="https://images.wondershare.com/filmora/article-images/2022/01/video-mergers-without-watermark-11.jpg"
                      alt="video-mergers-without-watermark.html"
                ></p>
<p>Anyway, if you want to combine a lot of files and the size of them all exceeds 100 MB, you will not be able to use Online Uniconverter for that. It supports the video no more than 100 MB and suggests using Wondershare UniConverter (originally Wondershare Video Converter Ultimate) for Desktop.</p>
<ul>
<li><strong>Wondershare Filmora</strong></li>
</ul>
<p>Last but not least – <a class="link"   target="_blank" rel="noopener" href="https://tools.techidaily.com/wondershare/filmora/download/" >Filmora Video Editor <i class="fa-regular fa-arrow-up-right-from-square fa-sm"></i></a> !

<p>So, in this article, we introduced some online platforms and software for you to use if you would like to merge videos and combine them into one. These are: Fastreel, Free Video Cutter Joiner, Clideo, Typito, Online UniConverter, Wondershare Filmora. It’s up to you which one you would like to choose to merge your videos or edit them in any other way, but you can try either of them and choose to your own liking – even so, of course, there are some other video mergers worth considering, that we might mention in the coming articles. Before then, enjoy with free video editors, without watermark!</p>
<p>If you are too lazy to get high-quality results using popular video editors, like Filmora, try Photos App. It is a built-in program that usually opens your images on Windows 10, but you can also use it for merging your videos. And guess what? Since it comes within the system, all the features, although limited, are absolutely free.</p>
<h3 id="How-to-Merge-Videos-on-Windows-using-Photos-App-1"><a href="#How-to-Merge-Videos-on-Windows-using-Photos-App-1" class="headerlink" title="How to Merge Videos on Windows using Photos App?"></a>How to Merge Videos on Windows using Photos App?</h3><p><img  
                     lazyload
                     src="/images/loading.svg"
                     data-src="https://images.wondershare.com/filmora/article-images/2023/03/merging-videos-photos-app.png"
                      alt="video-mergers-without-watermark.html"
                ></p>
<p>These are the steps to combine multiple clips in Windows 10 with Photos App.</p>
<p><strong>Step 1: Open Photos App</strong></p>
<p>Go to the ‘Start’ menu, find Photos App, and click to open it.</p>
<p><strong>Step 2: Make a New Project</strong></p>
<p>Click the ‘New video project’ (big blue box) under the ‘Video Projects’ tab. Alternatively, you can click the ‘New video’ button and select the ‘New video project’ option from the dropdown menu.</p>
<p><strong>Step 3: Add Clips</strong></p>
<p>Look for the text ‘Project library.’ Then click the ‘+ Add’ button. This will open a new window so you can select the clips you want to combine. Also, import videos one by one in a proper sequence because you cannot arrange them later.</p>
<p><strong>Step 4: Make a Storyboard</strong></p>
<p>After importing all the shots, you want to merge, click the ‘Place in storyboard’ button. This option will add all the chosen clips to your project’s storyboard.</p>
<ul>
<li><strong>Fastreel by Movavi</strong></li>
</ul>
<p><a class="link"   target="_blank" rel="noopener" href="https://www.fastreel.com/" >Fastreel <i class="fa-regular fa-arrow-up-right-from-square fa-sm"></i></a> is a free online video editor. It is extremely easy to use right away, without installing anything. So, on Fastreel, one can edit videos or use online templates in the browser itself. Actually, the first tool we see in the list of Fastreel tools is to merge a video; then, it can be used in order to compress, make, cut, and create a video. On fastreel, you can add a watermark to a video, if wanted - so, it is very voluntary. As for the merging of a video, when this tool is chosen, it’s pretty simple to understand the steps – you can just drop&#x2F;add multiple files right away.</p>
<p><img  
                     lazyload
                     src="/images/loading.svg"
                     data-src="https://images.wondershare.com/filmora/article-images/2022/01/video-mergers-without-watermark-1.jpg"
                      alt="video-mergers-without-watermark.html"
                ></p>
<p>The format must be either of the listed: MP4, MOV, MKV, AVI, and WMV, and the total size mustn’t exceed 500 MB. Then, in order to add some transitions, a style can be chosen from the drop-down menu, and after that, you should hit on Continue button to stitch the videos together. For the last step, you can export the result by selecting Download option.</p>
<p><img  
                     lazyload
                     src="/images/loading.svg"
                     data-src="https://images.wondershare.com/filmora/article-images/2022/01/video-mergers-without-watermark-2.jpg"
                      alt="video-mergers-without-watermark.html"
                ></p>
<ul>
<li><strong>Free Video Cutter Joiner</strong></li>
</ul>
<p><a class="link"   target="_blank" rel="noopener" href="https://www.freevideocutterjoiner.com/" >Free Video Cutter Joiner <i class="fa-regular fa-arrow-up-right-from-square fa-sm"></i></a> – the name already explains it all by itself! This is a free video merger which will not add watermark on your video. The software needs to be downloaded, and contributes to quickly cutting and joining videos. Free Video Cutter Joiner has no size limits – it can cut and merge videos with large file sizes without any trouble, and speed of it to do so is quite fast. It supports several file formats, such as AVI, MPEG, WMV, 3GP FLV, MP4, WMV, MOV, VOB, etc.</p>
<p>So, once downloaded, you will see how user-friendly and straightforward the software is: it shows two of its features right away – video cutter and video joiner. You choose which one you are about to use – so, in our case, video joiner.</p>
<p><img  
                     lazyload
                     src="/images/loading.svg"
                     data-src="https://images.wondershare.com/filmora/article-images/2022/01/video-mergers-without-watermark-3.jpg"
                      alt="video-mergers-without-watermark.html"
                ></p>
<p>Then, you should click the the “+” icon, which lets you add files from your PC.</p>
<p><img  
                     lazyload
                     src="/images/loading.svg"

                      alt="video-mergers-without-watermark.html"
                ></p>
<p>Then, hit on the Join button, and choose Indirect Join. Hitting on Start Join will start merging all the uploaded videos, and, wait a little until the process has been completed.</p>
<p><img  
                     lazyload
                     src="/images/loading.svg"

                      alt="video-mergers-without-watermark.html"
                ></p>
<ul>
<li><strong>Clideo</strong></li>
</ul>
<p><a class="link"   target="_blank" rel="noopener" href="https://clideo.com/" >Clideo <i class="fa-regular fa-arrow-up-right-from-square fa-sm"></i></a> is the online platform that declares that it makes it super easy to edit all your video files, images and GIFs, and is totally free. It gives us the opportunities to: merge, compress, resize, cut, make, crop, speed, rotate, add music to, loop, flip, reverse, mute, filter, and adjust the videos. Add subtitles, make memes, create slideshows, etc. Therefore, it’s pretty rich in its tools and features.</p>
<p>As for merging videos, much like Fastreel, Clideo is pretty straightforward. You just click on the mentioned tool, and then easily choose files you would like to combine – you can merge any amount of video clips there. Several files can be chosen at the same time, or they can be added one by one.</p>
<p><img  
                     lazyload
                     src="/images/loading.svg"
                     data-src="https://images.wondershare.com/filmora/article-images/2022/01/video-mergers-without-watermark-6.jpg"
                      alt="video-mergers-without-watermark.html"
                ></p>
<p>Then it will take you to the editor, where you can join the videos. It’s possible to rearrange the files, by using drag-and-drop until they’re in the desired order. You can also add images and set duration from them, add audio, change its length and volume. The last step is choosing the aspect ratio and clicking the Export button. You can watch the preview of your result and then click on Download if you are satisfied with the merged file.</p>
<p><img  
                     lazyload

                      alt="video-mergers-without-watermark.html"
                ></p>
<ul>
<li><strong>Typito</strong></li>
</ul>
<p><a class="link"   target="_blank" rel="noopener" href="https://typito.com/" >Typito <i class="fa-regular fa-arrow-up-right-from-square fa-sm"></i></a> is a platform to merge videos online, as well as Fastreel and Clideo. It is free, and mostly aims to create combinations one can use to post on social network such as Instagram, Facebook, and Youtube. Typito supports a great many formats, some of them being MP4, AVI, FLV and WMV. You can edit your videos before merging them by trimming, cropping and resizing, and also add transition effects and music. It quickly combines footage, doesn’t watermark the videos, has brand kit of colors, fonts and style. It can also create collection of images, which is used for making Youtube compilation at most times.</p>
<p>To merge videos, you should choose the tool, then Get Started, and register and sign in first.</p>
<p><img  
                     lazyload
                     src="/images/loading.svg"

                      alt="video-mergers-without-watermark.html"
                ></p>
<p>Then click on New Project, choose a video format (the platform offers you the list of the most popular ones), and it will take you to the editor, where you start off by adding media.</p>
<p><img  
                     lazyload
                     src="/images/loading.svg"
                     data-src="https://images.wondershare.com/filmora/article-images/2022/01/video-mergers-without-watermark-9.jpg"
                      alt="video-mergers-without-watermark.html"
                ></p>
<p>Drag and drop images or videos that you want to combine into a single video. You can also click to upload media files from your system or browse our Stock Media library for high-quality stock photos and video. Then, you can put your video clips in order, and work on it, if you want to use different tools, such as: edit, crop, trim, or resize them, as well as add text captions, images, and transitions. After you have previewed your video, you can click on the export button in the top right corner, and then, your merged video will be ready to be shared.</p>
<ul>
<li><strong>Online UniConverter</strong></li>
</ul>
<p>Online UniConverter is the next online platform giving us the chance to merge our videos without watermark. It is an online analogue of Wondershare UniConverter, and is a very powerful platform, where you can trim, split, rotate, adjust, and download videos in HD quality. UniConverter supports numerous video formats, including MP4, AVI, MOV, MP3, WEBM. Online UniConverter offers various transitions and aspect ratios to fit the screen.</p>
<p><img  
                     lazyload
                     src="/images/loading.svg"
                     data-src="https://images.wondershare.com/filmora/article-images/2022/01/video-mergers-without-watermark-10.jpg"
                      alt="video-mergers-without-watermark.html"
                ></p>
<p>The web-site has lots of tools and features to offer: in the description of it, it reads: video converter, video compressor, video editor, audio converter, audio compressor, audio cutter, GIF maker, YouTube thumbnail, and image resizer. Importing media to the online UniConverter is extremely easy, and combining videos turns out to be a quick process, too.</p>
<p><img  
                     lazyload
                     src="/images/loading.svg"

                      alt="video-mergers-without-watermark.html"
                ></p>
<p>Anyway, if you want to combine a lot of files and the size of them all exceeds 100 MB, you will not be able to use Online Uniconverter for that. It supports the video no more than 100 MB and suggests using Wondershare UniConverter (originally Wondershare Video Converter Ultimate) for Desktop.</p>

<p>So, in this article, we introduced some online platforms and software for you to use if you would like to merge videos and combine them into one. These are: Fastreel, Free Video Cutter Joiner, Clideo, Typito, Online UniConverter, Wondershare Filmora. It’s up to you which one you would like to choose to merge your videos or edit them in any other way, but you can try either of them and choose to your own liking – even so, of course, there are some other video mergers worth considering, that we might mention in the coming articles. Before then, enjoy with free video editors, without watermark!</p>
<p>If you are too lazy to get high-quality results using popular video editors, like Filmora, try Photos App. It is a built-in program that usually opens your images on Windows 10, but you can also use it for merging your videos. And guess what? Since it comes within the system, all the features, although limited, are absolutely free.</p>
<h3 id="How-to-Merge-Videos-on-Windows-using-Photos-App-2"><a href="#How-to-Merge-Videos-on-Windows-using-Photos-App-2" class="headerlink" title="How to Merge Videos on Windows using Photos App?"></a>How to Merge Videos on Windows using Photos App?</h3><p><img  
                     lazyload
                     src="/images/loading.svg"
                     data-src="https://images.wondershare.com/filmora/article-images/2023/03/merging-videos-photos-app.png"
                      alt="video-mergers-without-watermark.html"
                ></p>
<p>These are the steps to combine multiple clips in Windows 10 with Photos App.</p>
<p><strong>Step 1: Open Photos App</strong></p>
<p>Go to the ‘Start’ menu, find Photos App, and click to open it.</p>
<p><strong>Step 2: Make a New Project</strong></p>
<p>Click the ‘New video project’ (big blue box) under the ‘Video Projects’ tab. Alternatively, you can click the ‘New video’ button and select the ‘New video project’ option from the dropdown menu.</p>
<p><strong>Step 3: Add Clips</strong></p>
<p>Look for the text ‘Project library.’ Then click the ‘+ Add’ button. This will open a new window so you can select the clips you want to combine. Also, import videos one by one in a proper sequence because you cannot arrange them later.</p>
<p><strong>Step 4: Make a Storyboard</strong></p>
<p>After importing all the shots, you want to merge, click the ‘Place in storyboard’ button. This option will add all the chosen clips to your project’s storyboard.</p>
<ul>
<li><strong>Fastreel by Movavi</strong></li>
</ul>
<p><a class="link"   target="_blank" rel="noopener" href="https://www.fastreel.com/" >Fastreel <i class="fa-regular fa-arrow-up-right-from-square fa-sm"></i></a> is a free online video editor. It is extremely easy to use right away, without installing anything. So, on Fastreel, one can edit videos or use online templates in the browser itself. Actually, the first tool we see in the list of Fastreel tools is to merge a video; then, it can be used in order to compress, make, cut, and create a video. On fastreel, you can add a watermark to a video, if wanted - so, it is very voluntary. As for the merging of a video, when this tool is chosen, it’s pretty simple to understand the steps – you can just drop&#x2F;add multiple files right away.</p>
<p><img  
                     lazyload
                     src="/images/loading.svg"
                     data-src="https://images.wondershare.com/filmora/article-images/2022/01/video-mergers-without-watermark-1.jpg"
                      alt="video-mergers-without-watermark.html"
                ></p>
<p>The format must be either of the listed: MP4, MOV, MKV, AVI, and WMV, and the total size mustn’t exceed 500 MB. Then, in order to add some transitions, a style can be chosen from the drop-down menu, and after that, you should hit on Continue button to stitch the videos together. For the last step, you can export the result by selecting Download option.</p>
<p><img  
                     lazyload
                     src="/images/loading.svg"
                     data-src="https://images.wondershare.com/filmora/article-images/2022/01/video-mergers-without-watermark-2.jpg"
                      alt="video-mergers-without-watermark.html"
                ></p>
<ul>
<li><strong>Free Video Cutter Joiner</strong></li>
</ul>
<p><a class="link"   target="_blank" rel="noopener" href="https://www.freevideocutterjoiner.com/" >Free Video Cutter Joiner <i class="fa-regular fa-arrow-up-right-from-square fa-sm"></i></a> – the name already explains it all by itself! This is a free video merger which will not add watermark on your video. The software needs to be downloaded, and contributes to quickly cutting and joining videos. Free Video Cutter Joiner has no size limits – it can cut and merge videos with large file sizes without any trouble, and speed of it to do so is quite fast. It supports several file formats, such as AVI, MPEG, WMV, 3GP FLV, MP4, WMV, MOV, VOB, etc.</p>
<p>So, once downloaded, you will see how user-friendly and straightforward the software is: it shows two of its features right away – video cutter and video joiner. You choose which one you are about to use – so, in our case, video joiner.</p>
<p><img  
                     lazyload
                     src="/images/loading.svg"
                     data-src="https://images.wondershare.com/filmora/article-images/2022/01/video-mergers-without-watermark-3.jpg"
                      alt="video-mergers-without-watermark.html"
                ></p>
<p>Then, you should click the the “+” icon, which lets you add files from your PC.</p>
<p><img  
                     lazyload
                     src="/images/loading.svg"

                      alt="video-mergers-without-watermark.html"
                ></p>
<p>Then, hit on the Join button, and choose Indirect Join. Hitting on Start Join will start merging all the uploaded videos, and, wait a little until the process has been completed.</p>
<p><img  
                     lazyload
                     src="/images/loading.svg"

                      alt="video-mergers-without-watermark.html"
                ></p>
<ul>
<li><strong>Clideo</strong></li>
</ul>
<p><a class="link"   target="_blank" rel="noopener" href="https://clideo.com/" >Clideo <i class="fa-regular fa-arrow-up-right-from-square fa-sm"></i></a> is the online platform that declares that it makes it super easy to edit all your video files, images and GIFs, and is totally free. It gives us the opportunities to: merge, compress, resize, cut, make, crop, speed, rotate, add music to, loop, flip, reverse, mute, filter, and adjust the videos. Add subtitles, make memes, create slideshows, etc. Therefore, it’s pretty rich in its tools and features.</p>
<p>As for merging videos, much like Fastreel, Clideo is pretty straightforward. You just click on the mentioned tool, and then easily choose files you would like to combine – you can merge any amount of video clips there. Several files can be chosen at the same time, or they can be added one by one.</p>
<p><img  
                     lazyload
                     src="/images/loading.svg"

                      alt="video-mergers-without-watermark.html"
                ></p>
<p>Then it will take you to the editor, where you can join the videos. It’s possible to rearrange the files, by using drag-and-drop until they’re in the desired order. You can also add images and set duration from them, add audio, change its length and volume. The last step is choosing the aspect ratio and clicking the Export button. You can watch the preview of your result and then click on Download if you are satisfied with the merged file.</p>

                     lazyload

                ></p>
<ul>
<li><strong>Typito</strong></li>
</ul>
<p><a class="link"   target="_blank" rel="noopener" href="https://typito.com/" >Typito <i class="fa-regular fa-arrow-up-right-from-square fa-sm"></i></a> is a platform to merge videos online, as well as Fastreel and Clideo. It is free, and mostly aims to create combinations one can use to post on social network such as Instagram, Facebook, and Youtube. Typito supports a great many formats, some of them being MP4, AVI, FLV and WMV. You can edit your videos before merging them by trimming, cropping and resizing, and also add transition effects and music. It quickly combines footage, doesn’t watermark the videos, has brand kit of colors, fonts and style. It can also create collection of images, which is used for making Youtube compilation at most times.</p>
<p>To merge videos, you should choose the tool, then Get Started, and register and sign in first.</p>
<p><img  
                     lazyload
                     src="/images/loading.svg"

                      alt="video-mergers-without-watermark.html"
                ></p>
<p>Then click on New Project, choose a video format (the platform offers you the list of the most popular ones), and it will take you to the editor, where you start off by adding media.</p>
<p><img  
                     lazyload
                     src="/images/loading.svg"

                      alt="video-mergers-without-watermark.html"
                ></p>
<p>Drag and drop images or videos that you want to combine into a single video. You can also click to upload media files from your system or browse our Stock Media library for high-quality stock photos and video. Then, you can put your video clips in order, and work on it, if you want to use different tools, such as: edit, crop, trim, or resize them, as well as add text captions, images, and transitions. After you have previewed your video, you can click on the export button in the top right corner, and then, your merged video will be ready to be shared.</p>
<ul>
<li><strong>Online UniConverter</strong></li>
</ul>
<p>Online UniConverter is the next online platform giving us the chance to merge our videos without watermark. It is an online analogue of Wondershare UniConverter, and is a very powerful platform, where you can trim, split, rotate, adjust, and download videos in HD quality. UniConverter supports numerous video formats, including MP4, AVI, MOV, MP3, WEBM. Online UniConverter offers various transitions and aspect ratios to fit the screen.</p>
<p><img  
                     lazyload
                     src="/images/loading.svg"
                     data-src="https://images.wondershare.com/filmora/article-images/2022/01/video-mergers-without-watermark-10.jpg"
                      alt="video-mergers-without-watermark.html"
                ></p>
<p>The web-site has lots of tools and features to offer: in the description of it, it reads: video converter, video compressor, video editor, audio converter, audio compressor, audio cutter, GIF maker, YouTube thumbnail, and image resizer. Importing media to the online UniConverter is extremely easy, and combining videos turns out to be a quick process, too.</p>
<p><img  
                     lazyload
                     src="/images/loading.svg"

                      alt="video-mergers-without-watermark.html"
                ></p>
<p>Anyway, if you want to combine a lot of files and the size of them all exceeds 100 MB, you will not be able to use Online Uniconverter for that. It supports the video no more than 100 MB and suggests using Wondershare UniConverter (originally Wondershare Video Converter Ultimate) for Desktop.</p>

<p>Last but not least – <a class="link"   target="_blank" rel="noopener" href="https://tools.techidaily.com/wondershare/filmora/download/" >Filmora Video Editor <i class="fa-regular fa-arrow-up-right-from-square fa-sm"></i></a> !

<h3 id="How-to-Merge-Videos-on-Windows-using-Photos-App-3"><a href="#How-to-Merge-Videos-on-Windows-using-Photos-App-3" class="headerlink" title="How to Merge Videos on Windows using Photos App?"></a>How to Merge Videos on Windows using Photos App?</h3><p><img

<p>These are the steps to combine multiple clips in Windows 10 with Photos App.</p>
<p><strong>Step 1: Open Photos App</strong></p>
<p>Go to the ‘Start’ menu, find Photos App, and click to open it.</p>
<p><strong>Step 2: Make a New Project</strong></p>
<p>Click the ‘New video project’ (big blue box) under the ‘Video Projects’ tab. Alternatively, you can click the ‘New video’ button and select the ‘New video project’ option from the dropdown menu.</p>
<p><strong>Step 3: Add Clips</strong></p>
<p>Look for the text ‘Project library.’ Then click the ‘+ Add’ button. This will open a new window so you can select the clips you want to combine. Also, import videos one by one in a proper sequence because you cannot arrange them later.</p>
<p><strong>Step 4: Make a Storyboard</strong></p>
<p>After importing all the shots, you want to merge, click the ‘Place in storyboard’ button. This option will add all the chosen clips to your project’s storyboard.</p>

<li><strong>Fastreel by Movavi</strong></li>
</ul>
<p><a class="link"   target="_blank" rel="noopener" href="https://www.fastreel.com/" >Fastreel <i class="fa-regular fa-arrow-up-right-from-square fa-sm"></i></a> is a free online video editor. It is extremely easy to use right away, without installing anything. So, on Fastreel, one can edit videos or use online templates in the browser itself. Actually, the first tool we see in the list of Fastreel tools is to merge a video; then, it can be used in order to compress, make, cut, and create a video. On fastreel, you can add a watermark to a video, if wanted - so, it is very voluntary. As for the merging of a video, when this tool is chosen, it’s pretty simple to understand the steps – you can just drop&#x2F;add multiple files right away.</p>
<p><img  
                     lazyload
                     src="/images/loading.svg"

                      alt="video-mergers-without-watermark.html"
                ></p>
<p>The format must be either of the listed: MP4, MOV, MKV, AVI, and WMV, and the total size mustn’t exceed 500 MB. Then, in order to add some transitions, a style can be chosen from the drop-down menu, and after that, you should hit on Continue button to stitch the videos together. For the last step, you can export the result by selecting Download option.</p>
<p><img  
                     lazyload

<li><strong>Free Video Cutter Joiner</strong></li>
</ul>
<p><a class="link"   target="_blank" rel="noopener" href="https://www.freevideocutterjoiner.com/" >Free Video Cutter Joiner <i class="fa-regular fa-arrow-up-right-from-square fa-sm"></i></a> – the name already explains it all by itself! This is a free video merger which will not add watermark on your video. The software needs to be downloaded, and contributes to quickly cutting and joining videos. Free Video Cutter Joiner has no size limits – it can cut and merge videos with large file sizes without any trouble, and speed of it to do so is quite fast. It supports several file formats, such as AVI, MPEG, WMV, 3GP FLV, MP4, WMV, MOV, VOB, etc.</p>
<p>So, once downloaded, you will see how user-friendly and straightforward the software is: it shows two of its features right away – video cutter and video joiner. You choose which one you are about to use – so, in our case, video joiner.</p>
<p><img

                      alt="video-mergers-without-watermark.html"
                ></p>
<p>Then, you should click the the “+” icon, which lets you add files from your PC.</p>
<p><img

                ></p>
<p>Then, hit on the Join button, and choose Indirect Join. Hitting on Start Join will start merging all the uploaded videos, and, wait a little until the process has been completed.</p>
<p><img  
                     lazyload

                ></p>
<ul>
<li><strong>Clideo</strong></li>
</ul>
<p><a class="link"   target="_blank" rel="noopener" href="https://clideo.com/" >Clideo <i class="fa-regular fa-arrow-up-right-from-square fa-sm"></i></a> is the online platform that declares that it makes it super easy to edit all your video files, images and GIFs, and is totally free. It gives us the opportunities to: merge, compress, resize, cut, make, crop, speed, rotate, add music to, loop, flip, reverse, mute, filter, and adjust the videos. Add subtitles, make memes, create slideshows, etc. Therefore, it’s pretty rich in its tools and features.</p>
<p>As for merging videos, much like Fastreel, Clideo is pretty straightforward. You just click on the mentioned tool, and then easily choose files you would like to combine – you can merge any amount of video clips there. Several files can be chosen at the same time, or they can be added one by one.</p>
<p><img  
                     lazyload
                     src="/images/loading.svg"

                      alt="video-mergers-without-watermark.html"
                ></p>
<p>Then it will take you to the editor, where you can join the videos. It’s possible to rearrange the files, by using drag-and-drop until they’re in the desired order. You can also add images and set duration from them, add audio, change its length and volume. The last step is choosing the aspect ratio and clicking the Export button. You can watch the preview of your result and then click on Download if you are satisfied with the merged file.</p>

                     lazyload

<ul>
<li><strong>Typito</strong></li>
</ul>
<p><a class="link"   target="_blank" rel="noopener" href="https://typito.com/" >Typito <i class="fa-regular fa-arrow-up-right-from-square fa-sm"></i></a> is a platform to merge videos online, as well as Fastreel and Clideo. It is free, and mostly aims to create combinations one can use to post on social network such as Instagram, Facebook, and Youtube. Typito supports a great many formats, some of them being MP4, AVI, FLV and WMV. You can edit your videos before merging them by trimming, cropping and resizing, and also add transition effects and music. It quickly combines footage, doesn’t watermark the videos, has brand kit of colors, fonts and style. It can also create collection of images, which is used for making Youtube compilation at most times.</p>
<p>To merge videos, you should choose the tool, then Get Started, and register and sign in first.</p>
<p><img  
                     lazyload
                     src="/images/loading.svg"

                      alt="video-mergers-without-watermark.html"
                ></p>
<p>Then click on New Project, choose a video format (the platform offers you the list of the most popular ones), and it will take you to the editor, where you start off by adding media.</p>
<p><img  
                     lazyload
                     src="/images/loading.svg"

                      alt="video-mergers-without-watermark.html"
                ></p>
<p>Drag and drop images or videos that you want to combine into a single video. You can also click to upload media files from your system or browse our Stock Media library for high-quality stock photos and video. Then, you can put your video clips in order, and work on it, if you want to use different tools, such as: edit, crop, trim, or resize them, as well as add text captions, images, and transitions. After you have previewed your video, you can click on the export button in the top right corner, and then, your merged video will be ready to be shared.</p>
<ul>
<li><strong>Online UniConverter</strong></li>
</ul>
<p>Online UniConverter is the next online platform giving us the chance to merge our videos without watermark. It is an online analogue of Wondershare UniConverter, and is a very powerful platform, where you can trim, split, rotate, adjust, and download videos in HD quality. UniConverter supports numerous video formats, including MP4, AVI, MOV, MP3, WEBM. Online UniConverter offers various transitions and aspect ratios to fit the screen.</p>
<p><img  
                     lazyload
                     src="/images/loading.svg"
                     data-src="https://images.wondershare.com/filmora/article-images/2022/01/video-mergers-without-watermark-10.jpg"
                      alt="video-mergers-without-watermark.html"
                ></p>
<p>The web-site has lots of tools and features to offer: in the description of it, it reads: video converter, video compressor, video editor, audio converter, audio compressor, audio cutter, GIF maker, YouTube thumbnail, and image resizer. Importing media to the online UniConverter is extremely easy, and combining videos turns out to be a quick process, too.</p>
<p><img  
                     lazyload
                     src="/images/loading.svg"

                      alt="video-mergers-without-watermark.html"
                ></p>
<p>Anyway, if you want to combine a lot of files and the size of them all exceeds 100 MB, you will not be able to use Online Uniconverter for that. It supports the video no more than 100 MB and suggests using Wondershare UniConverter (originally Wondershare Video Converter Ultimate) for Desktop.</p>

<p>There are many choices of software for video editing, but there is one that has been dominating the market for years – this is Final Cut Pro. Final Cut Pro, which was created by Apple, and took on a completely different path from other professional software.</p>
<p>The unique thing about Final Cut Pro is that it allows you to create video files easily and even edit them on the Mac using Final Cut Pro software alone, without any outside help. Before buying Final cut pro, you may want to have a <a class="link"   target="_blank" rel="noopener" href="https://tools.techidaily.com/wondershare/filmora/download/" >90-day free trial of FCPX. <i class="fa-regular fa-arrow-up-right-from-square fa-sm"></i></a></p>
<p>The Mac App Store has made editing software more affordable. When Apple first acquired the Final Cut, it sold for $2,500, but now you can get a full version of the program from their store for only a cent shy of $300—an incredible deal.</p>
<h2 id="Part-1-What-is-in-Apple’s-Pro-Apps-Bundle-for-Education"><a href="#Part-1-What-is-in-Apple’s-Pro-Apps-Bundle-for-Education" class="headerlink" title="Part 1: What is in Apple’s Pro Apps Bundle for Education?"></a><strong>Part 1: What is in Apple’s Pro Apps Bundle for Education?</strong></h2><p>The Pro Apps Bundle includes five industry-leading professional software from Apple. These powerful creative tools are best for musicians, video editors, and anyone looking to create the best content.</p>
<p>Plus, this bundle is also available to students, educators, faculty members at colleges or universities, and employees of any K-12 school district. Apple’s Pro Apps Bundle for Education includes Final Cut Pro, Logic Studio, Motion, MainStage, and Compressor.</p>
<p><img  
                     lazyload
                     src="/images/loading.svg"
                     data-src="https://images.wondershare.com/filmora/images/final-cut-pro/pro-apps.png"
                      alt="pro-apps"
                ></p>
<p> Apple has set pricing for its Pro Apps Bundle for Education at $199.99. The bundle includes full versions of each software. There’s no time limit to ownership, and it doesn’t ask for a subscription or membership fee, unlike other subscription-based tools and software like Adobe Premiere Pro or Adobe Photoshop.</p>
<p>Apple’s Pro Apps Bundle for Education at $199.99 is totally worth getting if you plan to use Final Cut Pro and want Logic Studio and Mainstage 3 for free. If you’re thinking about purchasing Final Cut Pro or Logic Studio separately, be prepared to pay $299.99 and $199.99, respectively. MainStage is more affordable at $29.99. Motion and Compressor aren’t sold separately as they come bundled with Final Cut Pro.</p>
<p><strong>So, exactly how much are you saving here?</strong></p>
<p>If you need Final Cut Pro for work, we suggest you buy Pro Apps Bundle for Education, as you’ll be saving $100. You’ll also get Logic Pro and Mainstage for free. In total, you’ll be saving <strong>$330</strong>—an unbeatable deal if you ask me. I don’t anyone offers that kind of deal.</p>
<p>If you’re a musician or composer and have no use for Final Cut Pro, you can buy Logic Studio for $199.99—that’s your decision. But, you need to purchase Mainstage for $29.99, in case you need it. Nonetheless, we still recommend you get the Apple’s Pro Apps Bundle for Education at $199.99.</p>
<p>For beginners who don’t actually need those many apps can always go with a <strong>cheaper yet maybe better editor, Filmora</strong>. Click and have a try!</p>

<p>There are many choices of software for video editing, but there is one that has been dominating the market for years – this is Final Cut Pro. Final Cut Pro, which was created by Apple, and took on a completely different path from other professional software.</p>
<p>The unique thing about Final Cut Pro is that it allows you to create video files easily and even edit them on the Mac using Final Cut Pro software alone, without any outside help. Before buying Final cut pro, you may want to have a <a class="link"   target="_blank" rel="noopener" href="https://tools.techidaily.com/wondershare/filmora/download/" >90-day free trial of FCPX. <i class="fa-regular fa-arrow-up-right-from-square fa-sm"></i></a></p>
<p>The Mac App Store has made editing software more affordable. When Apple first acquired the Final Cut, it sold for $2,500, but now you can get a full version of the program from their store for only a cent shy of $300—an incredible deal.</p>
<h2 id="Part-1-What-is-in-Apple’s-Pro-Apps-Bundle-for-Education-1"><a href="#Part-1-What-is-in-Apple’s-Pro-Apps-Bundle-for-Education-1" class="headerlink" title="Part 1: What is in Apple’s Pro Apps Bundle for Education?"></a><strong>Part 1: What is in Apple’s Pro Apps Bundle for Education?</strong></h2><p>The Pro Apps Bundle includes five industry-leading professional software from Apple. These powerful creative tools are best for musicians, video editors, and anyone looking to create the best content.</p>
<p>Plus, this bundle is also available to students, educators, faculty members at colleges or universities, and employees of any K-12 school district. Apple’s Pro Apps Bundle for Education includes Final Cut Pro, Logic Studio, Motion, MainStage, and Compressor.</p>

<p> Apple has set pricing for its Pro Apps Bundle for Education at $199.99. The bundle includes full versions of each software. There’s no time limit to ownership, and it doesn’t ask for a subscription or membership fee, unlike other subscription-based tools and software like Adobe Premiere Pro or Adobe Photoshop.</p>
<p>Apple’s Pro Apps Bundle for Education at $199.99 is totally worth getting if you plan to use Final Cut Pro and want Logic Studio and Mainstage 3 for free. If you’re thinking about purchasing Final Cut Pro or Logic Studio separately, be prepared to pay $299.99 and $199.99, respectively. MainStage is more affordable at $29.99. Motion and Compressor aren’t sold separately as they come bundled with Final Cut Pro.</p>
<p><strong>So, exactly how much are you saving here?</strong></p>
<p>If you need Final Cut Pro for work, we suggest you buy Pro Apps Bundle for Education, as you’ll be saving $100. You’ll also get Logic Pro and Mainstage for free. In total, you’ll be saving <strong>$330</strong>—an unbeatable deal if you ask me. I don’t anyone offers that kind of deal.</p>
<p>If you’re a musician or composer and have no use for Final Cut Pro, you can buy Logic Studio for $199.99—that’s your decision. But, you need to purchase Mainstage for $29.99, in case you need it. Nonetheless, we still recommend you get the Apple’s Pro Apps Bundle for Education at $199.99.</p>

<p>There are many choices of software for video editing, but there is one that has been dominating the market for years – this is Final Cut Pro. Final Cut Pro, which was created by Apple, and took on a completely different path from other professional software.</p>
<p>The unique thing about Final Cut Pro is that it allows you to create video files easily and even edit them on the Mac using Final Cut Pro software alone, without any outside help. Before buying Final cut pro, you may want to have a <a class="link"   target="_blank" rel="noopener" href="https://tools.techidaily.com/wondershare/filmora/download/" >90-day free trial of FCPX. <i class="fa-regular fa-arrow-up-right-from-square fa-sm"></i></a></p>
<p>The Mac App Store has made editing software more affordable. When Apple first acquired the Final Cut, it sold for $2,500, but now you can get a full version of the program from their store for only a cent shy of $300—an incredible deal.</p>
<h2 id="Part-1-What-is-in-Apple’s-Pro-Apps-Bundle-for-Education-3"><a href="#Part-1-What-is-in-Apple’s-Pro-Apps-Bundle-for-Education-3" class="headerlink" title="Part 1: What is in Apple’s Pro Apps Bundle for Education?"></a><strong>Part 1: What is in Apple’s Pro Apps Bundle for Education?</strong></h2><p>The Pro Apps Bundle includes five industry-leading professional software from Apple. These powerful creative tools are best for musicians, video editors, and anyone looking to create the best content.</p>
<p>Plus, this bundle is also available to students, educators, faculty members at colleges or universities, and employees of any K-12 school district. Apple’s Pro Apps Bundle for Education includes Final Cut Pro, Logic Studio, Motion, MainStage, and Compressor.</p>

                ></p>
<p> Apple has set pricing for its Pro Apps Bundle for Education at $199.99. The bundle includes full versions of each software. There’s no time limit to ownership, and it doesn’t ask for a subscription or membership fee, unlike other subscription-based tools and software like Adobe Premiere Pro or Adobe Photoshop.</p>
<p>Apple’s Pro Apps Bundle for Education at $199.99 is totally worth getting if you plan to use Final Cut Pro and want Logic Studio and Mainstage 3 for free. If you’re thinking about purchasing Final Cut Pro or Logic Studio separately, be prepared to pay $299.99 and $199.99, respectively. MainStage is more affordable at $29.99. Motion and Compressor aren’t sold separately as they come bundled with Final Cut Pro.</p>
<p><strong>So, exactly how much are you saving here?</strong></p>
<p>If you need Final Cut Pro for work, we suggest you buy Pro Apps Bundle for Education, as you’ll be saving $100. You’ll also get Logic Pro and Mainstage for free. In total, you’ll be saving <strong>$330</strong>—an unbeatable deal if you ask me. I don’t anyone offers that kind of deal.</p>
<p>If you’re a musician or composer and have no use for Final Cut Pro, you can buy Logic Studio for $199.99—that’s your decision. But, you need to purchase Mainstage for $29.99, in case you need it. Nonetheless, we still recommend you get the Apple’s Pro Apps Bundle for Education at $199.99.</p>
