Just like 5KPlayer, VLC for Windows 10 handles mainstream HD/FHD movie codecs like H.264/H.265, and WebM unimpeded. Yet for media file management, this HD movie player isn't as intuitive as 5KPlayer due to the lack of a "play list mode", but it's just as convenient if you want to add subtitles to the movies.

Old versions of VLC interface running on Windows 7/8 have been regarded as outdated. Recently this HD player developer made an overhaul for VLC for Windows 10 UI - much better-looking â€“ however, just like other Windows Store APPs, stability issues remain ostentatious, with VLC not playing DVD and [VLC audio delay errors](https://tools.techidaily.com/5kplayer/video-music-player/) jumping out quite often.

**NO. 3 Ace Player HD: HD Movie Player with Torrent Support**

Now that bit torrent websites remain an effective (yet not advisable method) to get 1080p UHD/Full HD movies/content, there are a good amount of [torrent players](https://tools.techidaily.com/5kplayer/video-music-player/) out there, and Ace Player HD is one of them with HD support.

But stability is poor, with Softonic also referring to it as "less stable" - and that - for an HD movie player with backdoors to movie torrent, this is not hard to imagine.
