### **Wiki: What is H.265/HEVC Codec Mac?**

HEVC (High Efficiency Video Coding), also known as H.265 and MPEG-H Part 2, is a video compression standard created by ITU and ISO standardization bodies to act as the successor to AVC/H.264\. The main purpose to invent HEVC video codec is to significantly improve the video compression ratio to make a video contain more details with half size. That is to say, a 1GB video using HEVC coding method can be compressed to roughly 500MB without losing quality. HEVC encoding has largely helped smooth high-res video [4K streaming](https://tools.techidaily.com/5kplayer/airplay/) even in congested network environment and also allows us to download more 4K 8K contents and watch them on ultra HD displays.

Because of the higher quality and better compression rates, Apple also adopts HEVC in macOS High Sierra, iOS 11 and tvOS 11 to help save storage space and offer crystal-clear images. However, the disappointment is that Mac shipped with OS lower than macOS High Sierra can't encode or decode any HEVC videos. That's why we need H.265/HEVC codec Mac to turn QuickTime player into a professional [H.265/HEVC player Mac](https://tools.techidaily.com/5kplayer/video-music-player/) to help play highly-compressed HEVC videos.

#### **Further Reading: HEVC (H.265) vs. AVC (H.264)**

HEVC is the successor to AVC (H.264) while the HEVC video compression rate is much larger than H.264\. The HEVC standard enables a video to be compressed into a file that is half the size of a H.264/AVC file. Namely, when the size of a HEVC video and a H.264 video is the same, the HEVC video will surely offers much better visual quality than the AVC (H.264) video as the HEVC file will contain more details.

H.264 (AVC) and H.265 (HEVC) are both important to 4K high-res videos, so no matter you want to play a 4K video encoded with H.264 or H.265, a professional [4K video player](https://tools.techidaily.com/5kplayer/video-music-player/) is imperative.
