## 1\. Where and How to Download GOM Player Codec Pack?

Searching for specific GOM Player codec ac3, GOM Player codec MKV one by one is quite frustrating, why can't we get GOM Player with full codec download and solve the problem at once to avoid "Find Codec" dialog? Yes you can. But GOM official site provides limited codec for download like XVD videos in .xvd or vg2\. To get other codecs, you can download and install complete 3rd party [codec pack](https://tools.techidaily.com/5kplayer/video-music-player/) for GOM Player like CCCP, K-lite etc from their official sites. 

Note: We and GOM & Company do not officially endorse or recommend the installation of any additional codecs/codec pack, and cannot be held responsible for any problems or damages that arise from installing 3rd-party codecs. No matter for codec installation or codec pack download, there is always some unpredictable risks for which you shall be held responsible.

## 2\. How to Convert the Video File to the Supported Ones like MP3 MP4?

We suggest using [WinX Video Converter Deluxe](https://tools.techidaily.com/winxdvd/winxvideo-ai/). Through our test, this converter is by far the most stable and fast solution on the market. With built-in 4K QGC QSV encode, MultiCore processing and a reasonable price, this converter for GOM Player codec issue is a great one to turn to and is free for a 5min conversion to any codec format.

## 3\. Best GOM Player Alternative Player

The media player we suggest here is 5KPlayer. Indeed file codecs overlap can somehow trouble the playback of certain files, but it won't be a big trouble if you use only one player – 5KPlayer. This great multi media player includes almost all popular and less popular codecs for almost all media files so that you do not need to search for additional codec installation, perfectly standalone and one-stop on its own.
