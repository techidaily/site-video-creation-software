Those new to the Final Cut Pro or Pro X programs will be finding it a little challenging to [add effects](https://tools.techidaily.com/wondershare/filmora/download/) or edit videos. It’s a complex film editing software that takes a while to use. With our help, however, we can have you mastering the Ken Burns effect in Final Cut Pro. Do you want to know how to make ken burns effect in final cut pro? Listen closely.

* [**Part 1: How to Make Ken Burns Effect Final Cut Pro**](#Make-Ken-Burns-Effect)
* [**Part 2: How to Zoom in Final Cut Pro Using Keyframing**](#Zoom-in-Final-Cut-Pro-Keyframing)

## Part 1: How to Make Ken Burns Effect Final Cut Pro

To make a Ken Burns Effect, Final Cut Pro X (or a Ken Burns Effect on Final Cut, since they are both extensions of one another) simply follow our guide.

First, let’s talk about what Ken Burns is and why he has an effect named after him in Final Cut programs!

### What is the Ken Burns Effect

[Ken Burns](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Ken%5FBurns%5Feffect) is a world-famous American documentary filmmaker. He is well known for producing documentaries that take a candid if somewhat old-world-feeling look into different worlds. He has covered Baseball, the Civil War, and other fascinating times and places. Arguably, he is best known for using archival footage as film footage. How does he do this? By using the Ken Burns Effect, of course.

The Ken Burns Effect in Final Cut Pro X allows the editor to zoom in and out, slow pan, and scroll across archive photography and still film. This will enable you to substitute whole parts of the program you are making with photographs if you haven’t taken enough footage. It is commonly used in editing, particularly when making things like [wedding videos](https://tools.techidaily.com/wondershare/filmora/download/), which often feature lots of photos of the happy couple.

Anyway, let’s look at how you implement the Ken Burns Effect in Final Cut Pro.

### Steps to Making the Ken Burns Effect Final Cut Pro

Now that we know what is Ken Burns Effect. Let’s go over the steps to making the Ken Burns Effect in Final Cut Pro.

**Step 1** – Import your video. From your timeline workspace, select the clip, or highlight the section of the clip, that you want to apply the Ken Burns Effect to.

![import media](https://images.wondershare.com/filmora/filmorapro/import-media-final-cut-pro.JPG)

**Step 2** – Enter into the viewer mode to do this. From here, select the pop-up menu from the list of options at the bottom of the screen.

**Step 3** – Hold down both the shift key and the letter C. This is the fast way to cut out what you need. You can always stick to the right-click to cut a clip if you are more comfortable with this.

**Step 4** – scroll down until you find the Ken Burns Effect option in the control panel. The effect should now appear on your page, in the area you selected.

### Ken Burns Customization

You can also customize the ken burns effects in Final Cut.

**Step 1** – To transform from the Ken Burns Effect into customization mode, drag the green box in the viewer.

**Step 2** – Adjust the green box’s size, shape, and height until you are happy with where it is placed.

![customize ken burns effects](https://images.wondershare.com/filmora/filmorapro/customize-ken-burns-effects-box.JPG)

**Step 3** – Checking what you have already put in place using the preview option is a good idea at this stage. You can edit mistakes out later, but when you are trying to edit for speed, it is best to get it right the first time around!

**Step 4** – Adjust the viewer to accommodate any changes you need to make – don’t click the done button until you are sure. That being said, you can always back-step should you mis-click. You can also just start over with the effect customization if you messed up.

## Part 2: How to Zoom in Final Cut Pro Using Keyframing

Now that we know how to open and apply the Ken Burns Effect in Final Cut Pro. Let’s examine how we zoom in Final Cut Pro using keyframing. Keyframing, of course, involves [basic animation](https://tools.techidaily.com/wondershare/filmora/download/) that allows movement to be added to a still frame. So how do you use the Ken Burns Effect in Final Cut Pro X in conjunction with keyframing? Let’s talk you through it.

You can use keyframing to zoom and pan. We will talk you through how you use it to zoom in, and you should be able to work out the rest from there.

**Step 1** – Set the playhead at the start of the chosen clip. This is where you want the zoom effect to start from.

**Step 2** – Click to select the effects menu. It should be at the bottom of the screen.

**Step 3** – Seek out the scale and position tools. You can use these to size your animation, decide how much of a zoom you like, and how fast it will go.

![scale and position](https://images.wondershare.com/filmora/filmorapro/scale-and-position-final-cut.jpg)

**Step 4** – Follow keyframe > size > position and ensure your clip is covered as you need it. You can always come back to this step a few times if you don’t get it immediately right.

**Step 5** – Set the playhead where you want the clip and animation to end. Remember – if you zoom or pan too fast, you might glitch in your footage. Do it on time for the best results.

**As a Pro Tip**: you will be baled to view all keyframes on your clip if you select show video animation from your timeline.

## The Ken Burns Conclusion

The Ken Burns Effect is famous for a reason. It allows you to fill up space if you don’t have footage for certain things. It can be used to depict ancient battles without the use of CGI.

The Ken Burns Effect, Final Cut Pro (X) technique lets filmmakers go to places that they wouldn’t otherwise get to. It is excellent for both glimpsing into the past, and for flashing forward into imagined futures. Best of all, it lets you go there when you aren’t a big-budget Hollywood film producer. We love anything that saves a buck or two while we edit.

**Step 3** – Checking what you have already put in place using the preview option is a good idea at this stage. You can edit mistakes out later, but when you are trying to edit for speed, it is best to get it right the first time around!

**Step 4** – Adjust the viewer to accommodate any changes you need to make – don’t click the done button until you are sure. That being said, you can always back-step should you mis-click. You can also just start over with the effect customization if you messed up.

## Part 2: How to Zoom in Final Cut Pro Using Keyframing

Now that we know how to open and apply the Ken Burns Effect in Final Cut Pro. Let’s examine how we zoom in Final Cut Pro using keyframing. Keyframing, of course, involves [basic animation](https://tools.techidaily.com/wondershare/filmora/download/) that allows movement to be added to a still frame. So how do you use the Ken Burns Effect in Final Cut Pro X in conjunction with keyframing? Let’s talk you through it.

You can use keyframing to zoom and pan. We will talk you through how you use it to zoom in, and you should be able to work out the rest from there.

**Step 1** – Set the playhead at the start of the chosen clip. This is where you want the zoom effect to start from.

**Step 2** – Click to select the effects menu. It should be at the bottom of the screen.

**Step 3** – Seek out the scale and position tools. You can use these to size your animation, decide how much of a zoom you like, and how fast it will go.

![scale and position](https://images.wondershare.com/filmora/filmorapro/scale-and-position-final-cut.jpg)

**Step 4** – Follow keyframe > size > position and ensure your clip is covered as you need it. You can always come back to this step a few times if you don’t get it immediately right.

**Step 5** – Set the playhead where you want the clip and animation to end. Remember – if you zoom or pan too fast, you might glitch in your footage. Do it on time for the best results.

**As a Pro Tip**: you will be baled to view all keyframes on your clip if you select show video animation from your timeline.

## The Ken Burns Conclusion

The Ken Burns Effect is famous for a reason. It allows you to fill up space if you don’t have footage for certain things. It can be used to depict ancient battles without the use of CGI.

The Ken Burns Effect, Final Cut Pro (X) technique lets filmmakers go to places that they wouldn’t otherwise get to. It is excellent for both glimpsing into the past, and for flashing forward into imagined futures. Best of all, it lets you go there when you aren’t a big-budget Hollywood film producer. We love anything that saves a buck or two while we edit.

## Part 1: Getting Filmora for Free via Taking the Mission to Export 3 Videos

Another method is for users who have already installed Filmora on their devices. If you are using Filmora, you do not need to crack it in order to get **Filmora free**. You can earn the Filmora license by doing the mission of exporting three videos in total from the software. The method is quite simple and easy, but the mission is only available for Filmora 10.2 and above versions for a limited time. And the mission may be taken down sometime.

In order to do so, you have to follow the steps mentioned below.

[![Download Filmora X Win Version](https://images.wondershare.com/filmora/guide/download-btn-win.jpg) ](https://tools.techidaily.com/wondershare/filmora/download/) [![Download Filmora X Mac Version](https://images.wondershare.com/filmora/guide/download-btn-mac.jpg) ](https://tools.techidaily.com/wondershare/filmora/download/)

* To begin with, you need to download and install Filmora, and then launch Filmora and then click New Project to create a new project. Then you will see a pop-up window as shown below:

![ Filmora mission ](https://images.wondershare.com/filmora/article-images/get-filmora-for-free-take-mission.jpg)

Wondershare Filmora provides a 7-day license for users without Filmora subscription, and a perpetual effects pack for users already subscribed to it. Click the Take the Mission button to continue, and you will see the progress under the right corner.

![ complete Filmora mission ](https://images.wondershare.com/filmora/article-images/complete-mission-to-get-filmora-for-free.jpg)

Now, it’s time to import, edit and export video footage with Filmora. There are several ways to import media to Filmora, and the direct way is drag and drop the photo and video into the Project media library, and then place them in order in the timeline.

![ import  import your media files to Filmora  ](https://images.wondershare.com/filmora/guide/import-media-file-to-filmora-1.jpg)

* If you need to cut out some clips from the footage, you can trim, split, or crop it easily. Right-click the footage in the timeline, and you will find the most commonly used editing tools.
* You can follow the software layout to add audio, titles, transitions, effects, elements accordingly. If you wish to [add sound to your video](https://tools.techidaily.com/wondershare/filmora/download/), go to "Audio" tab, find the proper music track or sound effect for your footage, and then drag it to the soundtrack in the timeline.

![ add sound effects ](https://images.wondershare.com/filmora/guide/select-theme-music.jpg)

* The titles tab provides hundreds of titles and texts templates, including openers, titles, Lower 3rds, subtitles, and end credits. You can also use the Plain text template without animations and add some callouts.
* In the next step, add overlays or [transitions in your video](https://tools.techidaily.com/wondershare/filmora/download/), and if you have finished the editing, press Ctrl+S to save the project.

![ add transitions ](https://images.wondershare.com/filmora/guide/filters-filmora-win.jpg)

* Finally, click on the "Export" button and select the "Local" tab. Choose a name and file format for your video and tap "Export."

![save your video](https://images.wondershare.com/filmora/guide/go-to-export-panel.jpg)

Once you are done with compiling one video, follow the same steps as mentioned above twice more so that you have exported three videos in total from Filmora. You can see your progress in the gift box in the right corner. Click Claim Your Rewards and you will a pop-up window as shown below.

![ claim your Filmora license](https://images.wondershare.com/filmora/article-images/claim-free-filmora-license.jpg)

Now, click the **Claim your Free 7-day License** button, by doing so, you will get the Filmora License, i.e., your Filmora version is now full and free.

Once you have acquired the **Filmora free** license, you can go back and import the previous projects, edit again and remove the watermark.

Launch Filmora again, and then find the project you just made in the Start window and open it. Or you can click New Project to enter the main interface, click File - Open Recent, find the project. Log in with your Wondershare ID and click on the "Export" button. Your video will now be exported without a watermark.

This method is quite easy to get the **Filmora free** version. But as it said before, it is a 7-day limited license, how about if you want it to be longer? No worries, read on and you will find out how.

## Part 2: Most Easy and Creative Features in Filmora (You Should Definitely Try)

Now you have the **Filmora free** version on your device. That means that you have now successfully gained access to multiple features of Wondershare Filmora for free. Filmora offers its users several unique and creative features that can be used to make your videos top-notch. Mastering these tools requires lots of practice, but the end result is definitely worth it all.

Users generally do not have an idea of how to make the most out of their tool. Here, we have mentioned some of the fun and easy-to-use features offered by Filmora that you should definitely try as an aspiring content creator.

### 1. Filmora Green Screen

The Green Screen effect by Filmora is an advanced feature of the Overlays option. It enables users to combine two overlaid clips in such a way that the background of the lower layer can be visible on the top layer. It uses a color range in the top clip to make it shine through. You can get this effect by using a green background while shooting videos.

[![Download Filmora X Win Version](https://images.wondershare.com/filmora/guide/download-btn-win.jpg) ](https://tools.techidaily.com/wondershare/filmora/download/) [![Download Filmora X Mac Version](https://images.wondershare.com/filmora/guide/download-btn-mac.jpg) ](https://tools.techidaily.com/wondershare/filmora/download/)

The Green Screen effect can be used to place subjects over a number of different backgrounds. You can make a green screen on Filmora by simply clicking on the chroma key. It also offers spill removal, color correction, filters, and transition effects to use on your green screen.

### 2. Filmora Split Screen

The Split Screen feature in Wondershare Filmora allows you to display multiple clips on the screen at the same time. This feature comes in handy when you want to compare different angled shots or add two or more clips to your video. The effect helps users to add a specific style and class into your video.

Filmora currently offers around 30 split screen templates. You can add up to 6 different video clips in these presets at the same time. The default duration of the split screen is 5 seconds, but you can adjust it according to your requirements. You can add all kinds of borders, do a color correction, tuning and apply motion effects on your split-screen.

### 3. Filmora Beat Detection

**[Wondershare Filmora Video Editor](https://tools.techidaily.com/wondershare/filmora/download/)** offers a Beat Detection option for users, which marks audio beats from the inserted sound clip in your video automatically. The tool makes it easy to match your edits with the music, allowing a smooth clip. Analyzing and detecting the beats is entirely automatic. Using Filmora, syncing your video to the music is now relatively easy and quick. Even the customization of beat markers doesn't take long. It is an excellent tool for filming, even for people who are first-timers. You can change the highlight beat frequency, offset or add transitions in your beats. This will allow your videos to appear more in-sync and vivid.

#### Conclusion

You can now go on and spread the news. Wondershare Filmora can now be downloaded and used for free without paying any extra money. Using the methods mentioned above, you can get **Filmora free download** on your device without any crack or spending a dollar. Also, try the wonderful features of Filmora to get the most out of your videos and photos.
