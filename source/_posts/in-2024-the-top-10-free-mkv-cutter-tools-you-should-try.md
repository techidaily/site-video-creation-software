Before you start working on your new reaction video, you need to make sure that you have all the media files you want you to use in your project. You can then simply import them into iMovie, and place footage of yourself reacting to a video to the timeline. Afterward, you should place the actual video to which you are reacting above or below the video file that contains the footage of your reaction, depending on which video clip you want to use as a background video.

However, the overlaid video is not going to be automatically visible in the preview screen, so you should just click on the Video Overlay Settings and pick the Picture in Picture option.

When ready, you should export your reaction video and upload it to your channel.

You can then repeat the same process to select Audio Output Capture option, in order to record the audio from the video youâ€™re reacting to. Afterward, you should head over to the Add menu once more and add the Video Capture Device to the Sources tab.

The video containing your reaction should be below the video you are commenting on so that the second video can be treated as an overlay. Click on the Event Pan/Crop button and readjust the size and the on-screen location of the video youâ€™re reacting to. When done, you can proceed to sync both videos so that your reactions correspond with the events in the other video.

Letâ€™s take a look at what the top 5 reaction video makers have to offer.

### 1\. [Filmora](https://tools.techidaily.com/wondershare/filmora/download/)

[![Download Filmora9 Win Version](https://images.wondershare.com/filmora/guide/download-btn-win.jpg) ](https://tools.techidaily.com/wondershare/filmora/download/) [![Download Filmora9 Mac Version](https://images.wondershare.com/filmora/guide/download-btn-mac.jpg) ](https://tools.techidaily.com/wondershare/filmora/download/)

Filmora grants you access to all the tools you are going to need while creating a reaction video Its screen recorder tool enables you to capture your computerâ€™s screen and the webcam footage simultaneously so that you can record the video to which you are recording as well as your reaction at the same time. Watch the video below to explore how Daniel record and make a reaction video with Filmora.

Optionally, you can capture your computerâ€™s screen and your reaction separately and then use Filmora to sync these two video files. The first thing you will have to do if you decide to use this method of creating a reaction video is to create a project and import all footage into it. You should then place the footage on two separate video tracks on the timeline, and readjust the size of each video in the preview window.

Filmora lets you remove the background of the video clips you donâ€™t want to include in the final cut with the human segmentation effect under AI Portrait. This feature allows you to [separate people from the video background](https://tools.techidaily.com/wondershare/filmora/download/), and replace them with a new one. And then you can blend the reaction video with the original one fluently. After you complete the video editing process you can export your project to your YouTube or Vimeo account directly from Filmora.

In order to start making a reaction video with VSDC, you must first record your reaction to the video and make sure that the video youâ€™re reacting to is saved on your computerâ€™s hard drive. You should then create a new project in VSDC, specify the resolution for the entire project and proceed to import all media files youâ€™re going to need during the video editing process, by selecting the Video option from the Add Object menu.

Place the files on the editorâ€™s timeline so that they are positioned one above the other. The reaction video should occupy the full screen, and you can use the preview window to adjust the size of the reaction video. You should than readjust the on-screen position and the size of the video youâ€™re reacting to, before proceeding to preview the resulting video.

The process of making a reaction video in iMovie isnâ€™t much different from the process of making any other type of video. Before you start working on your new reaction video, you need to make sure that you have all the media files you want you to use in your project. You can then simply import them into iMovie, and place footage of yourself reacting to a video to the timeline. Afterward, you should place the actual video to which you are reacting above or below the video file that contains the footage of your reaction, depending on which video clip you want to use as a background video.

However, the overlaid video is not going to be automatically visible in the preview screen, so you should just click on the Video Overlay Settings and pick the Picture in Picture option. As soon as you select this option the overlay video will become visible in the preview window, where you can adjust its size and position. When ready, you should export your reaction video and upload it to your channel.

After you launch OBS, you should select the For Recording option, and this reaction video maker will optimize the project settings automatically. Once the OBSâ€™ main window loads, you just have to specify the sources from which you want to record the footage. Simply right-click anywhere within the Sources tab, select the Add option and choose the Display Capture setting from the submenu.

You can then repeat the same process to select Audio Output Capture option, in order to record the audio from the video youâ€™re reacting to. Afterward, you should head over to the Add menu once more and add the Video Capture Device to the Sources tab. Optionally, you can readjust the size of each video source in the Preview Window, and hit the Start Recording button.

* Free for PC and Mac users
* Enables users to specify the format of the output video
* Captures videos in HD resolution

**Price:** Freemium

**Compatibility:** Windows

Both the video of your reaction and the video to which you are reacting must be recorded before you start editing them in Sony Vegas Pro. Making a reaction video with this video editing software is a relatively easy task that only requires you to position your footage correctly on the timeline.

The video containing your reaction should be below the video you are commenting on so that the second video can be treated as an overlay. Click on the Event Pan/Crop button and readjust the size and the on-screen location of the video youâ€™re reacting to. When done, you can proceed to sync both videos so that your reactions correspond with the events in the other video. Donâ€™t forget to preview the reaction video youâ€™ve created before exporting it.

**Pros**

* Offers professional video editing tools
* Grants users full control over the footage
* Intuitive and modernly designed interface
* Supports a broad range of output file formats

**Cons**

* Aimed only at professional video editors

Among all these above, if you want to go for a free one, I'll say you should go for **OBS.**

If you want to go for a paid one but don't want to pay too much for it, I'll suggest you go for **Filmora**, which provides you several ways to create a reaction video easily on Windows and Mac.
