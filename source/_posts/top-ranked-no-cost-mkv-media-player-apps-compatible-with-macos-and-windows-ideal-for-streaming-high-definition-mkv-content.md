MKV is a very popular container to store audio, video, images and subtitles. The specialized nature of the best MKV player is to play MKV files without the need of converting them so as to let you watch these files in their original quality. DearMob Inc. has released a new MKV player for Mac/PC, namely [5KPlayer](https://tools.techidaily.com/5kplayer/products/), which has soon become one of the strongest competitors of MPlayerX and VLC, whose reputation as the best MKV players, are fully acquainted by Mac and Windows users. But which one would you vote as the best MKV player?

**A brief Introduction of This New Best MKV Player**

As a Mac/ Windows user, you surely have heard enough about MPlayerX and VLC. Here is a brief introduction of this newly added best MKV player - 5KPlayer for you to know more about it.

 5KPlayer is the best MKV player for playing MKV video files on PC and Mac easily with high quality. Apart from playing MKV files, it can also play a variety of video formats such as AVI, MP4, M2TS, M4V, MPEG-4, MOV, WMV, etc. and nearly all audio formats like MP3, AAC, OGG, WMA, FLAC, etc. thanks to its tremendous video playback capacity.

And this best MKV Player is very easy to operate.

## Comparing the Main Qualities of Best 3 MKV Players

When it comes to MKV player, VLC or MPlayerX will jump into the recommendation, those MKV players are undoubtedly the best two MKV players you would choose. However, 5KPlayer now is also a professional [free MKV video player](https://tools.techidaily.com/5kplayer/video-music-player/) which is widely recognized due to its cutting edge advantage of better playing full HD and ultra HD MKV files than MPlayerX and VLC. Now, let's compare them in three different aspects for your reference.

**Best MKV Players – Main Interface**

Like VLC, 5KPlayer does have a straightforward main interface but MPlayerX does not. MPlayerX strives for simple interface, but it overlooked that some users would prefer a manageable window of control than staring at a playing window and monkeying with every button. But compared to VLC whose interface is too complicated, the style of 5KPlayer is more attractive and user-friendly. It lists every function with the related icon: Play music, video, listen to online radio, and download videos from online video sites, and stream media with the function of [AirPlay](https://tools.techidaily.com/5kplayer/airplay/).

**Best MKV Players – Playback Settings**

Compared to 5KPlayer, MPlayerX doesn't have a playlist, saying the playlist is unnecessary if it can go straight to the next episode or next video as long as they are in the same folder. But for some users who got used to checking the play history and jumping between chapters should want that list to look through and 5KPlayer can be the best MKV player that is available to choose chapter when playing.  
 Like MPlayerX and VLC, 5Kplayer can also switch the subtitle track and audio track, and you can set it right on the interface and in the "preference" outside of the playback window. And more interesting, it supports rotating the MKV video right to left, left to right and upside down.

**Best MKV Players – Image Quality**

5KPlayer supports progressive scan which has the advantage of making every motion appear smoother and more realistic. With progressive scan there is no necessity in intentional blurring of videos. To put it this way, if a user wants to watch a movie with .mkv extension, and he wants to bring out the best image quality of this original MKV movie, correctly installing the 5KPlayer on your Mac OS and Windows is indeed the best choice.
