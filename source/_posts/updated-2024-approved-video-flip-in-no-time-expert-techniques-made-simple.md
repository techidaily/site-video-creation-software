Then double click the video in the timeline to access the editing panel. In the window that appears, switch to Video tab and you will find Transform option located on the top.

Click on the Transform to expand the four options including Rotate, Flip, Scale and Position.

* **Flip:** Flip video horizontally, i.e. flip video left to right; flip video vertically that is fliping video upside down
* You can combine Rotate and Flip feature to flip video vertically and rotate 90°clockwise or flip video vertically and rotate 90°counterclockwise.

Besides, you can also change the video position and the video scale. This is the step of flips the whole part of the video.

#### 3. Flip Only a Part of the Video

Sometimes, you may just need to flip parts of your video file, e.g. only 1 minute instead of the whole video. In this case, you need to [split your video into separate files](https://tools.techidaily.com/wondershare/filmora/download/), and then repeat step 2 to flip them individually.

To do it, just move the playhead to the position you want to split, and click the "Scissors" icon in the menu bar.
