**Step 4.** Name it. It would be better to add some descriptions for easy understanding.   
 Notice: Please name your video with a recognizable name and descriptions as you may have different videos to bookmark.

**Step 5.** Click on "Add bookmark" to save the part.

### Other Bookmark Video Players Free Download

Besides 5KPlayer, there are also many other well-known media players that own the ability. BTW, including 5KPlayer, all of them allow you to restart the playback where you left off last time with a resume playback feature.

**1\. PotPlayer**  
**How to:** Open a video with PotPlayer > right-click on the video and choose Playback > Chapter/Bookmark > Add Bookmark.   
**Cons:** You can’t add any descriptions to your bookmarks.

**How to:** Open a video with VLC > click on Playback on the top bar > Custom Bookmarks > click on Manage or you can simply tap the Ctrl+B to pop up the Edit Bookmarks window > in the new popup window, just click on the Create button to add bookmarks to your video.

**4\. KMPlayer**  
**How to:** Play a video with KMPlayer > right-click on the playing window and choose Bookmarks/Chapter > choose Add to bookmarks.
