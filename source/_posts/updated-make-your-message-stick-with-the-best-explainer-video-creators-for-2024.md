All types of vistas change as time passes. Consequently, an outdoor scene looks differently throughout different parts of the day, which makes it impossible to capture the full extent of its beauty by snapping a single photo or recording a short video of it.

That is why you must utilize the **time-lapse technique** to depict the passage of time at a particular shooting location and create a sequence in your video that suggests that a certain amount of time has passed by. So in this article, we will take you through some of the **best time-lapse video editing software** you can find on the market in 2024.

## Best Time-Lapse Video Post-Production Software in 2024

There are two different recording methods you can use to create time-lapse videos. You can either **record videos or take photos at a precisely set interval**, but regardless of the approach you choose, you must have the right equipment for the job.

This means that you must have a time-lapse tripod that ensures the smooth movement of your camera, an intervalometer, and a camera setup capable of taking pictures or recording videos over an extended period of time.

Most importantly, you must have access to a [video editor](https://tools.techidaily.com/wondershare/filmora/download/) that enables you to process the footage and control its playback rate. Let's take a look at the best post-production software products that allow its users to create stunning time-lapses video.

#### 1. [Filmora](https://tools.techidaily.com/wondershare/filmora/download/): Best Time-lapse Software for Beginners \[Windows & Mac\]

**Price:**  Freemium

**Compatibility:**  Windows, macOS

[![Download Win Version](https://images.wondershare.com/filmora/guide/download-btn-win.jpg)](https://tools.techidaily.com/wondershare/filmora/download/)[![Download Mac Version](https://images.wondershare.com/filmora/guide/download-btn-mac.jpg)](https://tools.techidaily.com/wondershare/filmora/download/)

Mac and PC users can create time-lapse videos with Filmora effortlessly, even though the actual steps you will need to take throughout the process depend on the type of footage you're using to create a time-lapse. If you decide to make a time-lapse out of still images, you must ensure that you have enough footage since the video you're producing must have 24 or 30 frames per second. That's why you need **30 or 24 photos** for each second of your time-lapse video, and you must arrange all of these images on the editor's timeline before you begin adjusting their duration.

![ Filmora Timelapse video making](https://images.wondershare.com/filmora/article-images/make-timelapse-video-from-photos-in-filmora-1.jpg)

Select all timeline photos placed in the timeline panel, right-click to access the   **Duration setting**, and then **set the input duration of each picture to 0.01 seconds**.

Click OK to continue, and you'll find that the duration of all timelapse photos has changed to a brief second. Click the playback button in the Preview window, and you'll see the time-lapse video is made already.

If you are working with video files, you should **double the playback rate** to create the time-lapse effect. The results you will get largely depend on the quality of the footage you've recorded. You must do everything in your power to capture the photos or videos properly before you start the video editing process.

#### 2. [iMovie](https://www.apple.com/imovie/): Best Free Time-lapse Software for Mac

**Price:**  Free

**Compatibility:**  macOS and iOS

iMovie may not be the most advanced video editing software for Mac computers, but that doesn't mean that you can't use iMovie to create time-lapse videos. In fact, all you have to do to make a time-lapse video with this software is to arrange the photos on the editor's timeline and change their duration to **0.1** seconds from the **Clip Information panel**.

However, if you do this, your time-lapse video will play only **10 frames per second**, so to [speed it up](https://tools.techidaily.com/wondershare/filmora/download/), you first have to export the video you've created in this manner and then import it back into iMovie.

Afterward, you can select the **Custom option** from the **Speed menu** that lets you select the playback speed of a video clip. Making a time-lapse video in iMovie is a slow process that requires a lot of patience, especially if you are working with a large number of photos or video clips.

**Price:**  Free

**Compatibility:**  Windows

This open-source video editor is commonly used for batch-processing of **AVI video files** and sets of **BMP image files**. Even though VirtualDub doesn't offer a lot of video editing tools, its batch-processing capabilities make it a perfect choice for all PC users who want to create time-lapse videos.

Nonetheless, the process of making a time-lapse in VirtualDub is highly technical as you'll need to make sure that all the images you want to use in the video are the **same size**. Besides, you'll have to set up the **video's [frame rate](https://tools.techidaily.com/wondershare/filmora/download/), [aspect ratio](https://tools.techidaily.com/wondershare/filmora/download/), and compression manually**, before you can apply it to all files you imported into the video editor. That's why you first need to familiarize yourself with VirtualDub and then start using it to make time-lapse videos.

GoPro's Quik video editor features all the tools you're going to need to organize large quantities of video and photo files and create time-lapse videos. The software also enables you to add **panning effects** to your time-lapses that simulate the camera movement.

**Price:**  $299.99

Controlling the playback speed of the files you import into a project in FCPX is simple, since you just have to place the photos or videos on the timeline and select them. Afterward, you should head over to the **Retime** submenu that is located in the **Modify drop-down menu** and select one of the **Custom Speed, Blade Speed or Fast** options.

You will have to tweak the particular settings depending on the option you select, but your main goal should be to speed up the footage just enough to suggest the rapid passage of time. Try out different values to find the playback speed that is best suited for the time-lapse video you're working on.

#### 6. [Adobe Premiere Pro](https://www.adobe.com/products/premiere.html) : Best Professional Video Editing Software for Time-lapse Video on Windows

**Price:**  $20.99 per month as a single app

 Mar 27, 2024• Proven solutions

All types of vistas change as time passes. Consequently, an outdoor scene looks differently throughout different parts of the day, which makes it impossible to capture the full extent of its beauty by snapping a single photo or recording a short video of it.

That is why you must utilize the **time-lapse technique** to depict the passage of time at a particular shooting location and create a sequence in your video that suggests that a certain amount of time has passed by. So in this article, we will take you through some of the **best time-lapse video editing software** you can find on the market in 2024.

## Best Time-Lapse Video Post-Production Software in 2024

There are two different recording methods you can use to create time-lapse videos. You can either **record videos or take photos at a precisely set interval**, but regardless of the approach you choose, you must have the right equipment for the job.

This means that you must have a time-lapse tripod that ensures the smooth movement of your camera, an intervalometer, and a camera setup capable of taking pictures or recording videos over an extended period of time.

Most importantly, you must have access to a [video editor](https://tools.techidaily.com/wondershare/filmora/download/) that enables you to process the footage and control its playback rate. Let's take a look at the best post-production software products that allow its users to create stunning time-lapses video.

Mac and PC users can create time-lapse videos with Filmora effortlessly, even though the actual steps you will need to take throughout the process depend on the type of footage you're using to create a time-lapse. If you decide to make a time-lapse out of still images, you must ensure that you have enough footage since the video you're producing must have 24 or 30 frames per second. That's why you need **30 or 24 photos** for each second of your time-lapse video, and you must arrange all of these images on the editor's timeline before you begin adjusting their duration.

![ Filmora Timelapse video making](https://images.wondershare.com/filmora/article-images/make-timelapse-video-from-photos-in-filmora-1.jpg)
