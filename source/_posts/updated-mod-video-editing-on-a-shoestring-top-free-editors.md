The size of the videos you capture with your Smartphone or digital camera can sometimes be just too large for online use. Videos recorded in Full HD or **4K resolutions** can take hours to upload to any of the video file hosting services and they often exceed the **video** **size limitations on social media networks.**

PC owners who often upload video content to their social media accounts or run a YouTube channel can **easily compress their footage on Windows 10**.
