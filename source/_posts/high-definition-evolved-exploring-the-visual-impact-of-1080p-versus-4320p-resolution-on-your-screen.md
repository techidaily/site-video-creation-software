## 1080p vs. 4320p Video: Is 8K Really A Better Choice?

 _Posted by [Kaylee Wood](https://www.quora.com/profile/Amanda-Hu-21) | Last update: April 28, 2020_

Confused about 1080p & 4320p resolution videos? This article details on everything you need to know about 1080p full HD videos and 4320p, aka 8K Quad UHD videos. If you're hesitating to purchase a better expensive monitor. Read on, and you'll find these thoughts rather insane.

#### **Let's get started from the 1080p VS. 4320p comparison:**

#### a. 1080p VS. 4320p Video –Sharpness:

From the aspect of data, 1080p means 1920 x 1080p = 2073600 pixels; 4320p means: 7680 x 4320p = 33177600 pixels, that's a damn 15 time increase! But, have you ever thought about real experience –bigger file sizes for higher levels of detail means you being able to all the better make out the pores and poxes on one's face while they're on TV, and that would be awful. As human eyes can tell only so much detail, 4320p video is way beyond our visual ability. And how many of us are willing to face a 4320 monitor as large as a TV set on their desk? Though, more resolution means more potential in all sorts of areas, that's for speculators.

#### b. 1080p VS. 4320p Video – Universalization:

**1\. 1080p VS. 4320p Video sources;**  
Unlike 1080p video, 4320p videos are really limited to a few test video clips, while 1080p videos and movies are everywhere, online or contained in Blu-ray discs. 

**2\. 1080p VS. 4320p Video –net speed and bandwidth;**  
At least for now, the best internet speed and bandwidth cannot yet meet the 4320p video requirement for a smooth view. 

#### c. 1080p VS. 4320p Resolution –Hardware & Software

**1\. 1080p VS. 4320p Video –Hardware**  
For both Mac and Windows computers, 4320p videos require much more than the average level of computer specs, which can easily deal with 1080p videos.   
**Mac:** 5120-by-2880 resolution with a 3.3GHz quad-core Intel Core i5 processor and an AMD Radeon R9 M290 graphics processor with 2GB of GDDR5 memory  
**Windows:** Intel Core 4th Generation i7-4790, 12GB DDR3, 1TB HDD, NVIDIA GeForce GT 720 1GB DDR3.  
Therefore, before miring yourself in massive expenses, think about whether you've got that much money to burn. And FYI, if you want a 4320p monitor for gaming, forget it. That can be even demanding!

**2\. 1080p VS. 4320p Video – Software:**   
A lot more media players like WMP, can play 1080p videos but fall short in 4320p video playback support. In case that you seriously mean to find a media player that can handle 1080p & 4320p videos, we would suggest you [5KPlayer](https://tools.techidaily.com/5kplayer/products/). The combination of functions –download, play and [AirPlay](https://tools.techidaily.com/5kplayer/airplay/) makes 5KPlayer nothing short of a rarity with a lovely UI. And above all, it's totally free!

From the comparisons you can see that we're not here intended to make you feel better, but 8K res really gets a long way ahead as it's still in its infancy. Every new technique rolling out does not necessarily mean that we all should grab a piece of it, but we can begin preparing something cost-free like 5KPlayer that connects now and the future seamlessly, which for sure enables you to free download and play both 1080p&4320p videos from [over 300 online websites](https://tools.techidaily.com/5kplayer/youtube-download/) and can AirPlay the 1080p & 4320p movie videos [from your Mac/Windows to HDTV](https://tools.techidaily.com/5kplayer/airplay/).
