<p>Video content is becoming increasingly popular; with the proliferation of online content, practically every product now needs its mini-documentary or video clip. Experienced filmmakers and VFX artists used to be the only ones who could get smooth footage. Those days, however, are over.</p>
<p>Adobe After Effects is an excellent tool for smoothing out video footage, in addition to being a great blending and motion animation software; although it’s usually preferable to maintain your film as seamless as possible on location, it’s not the end of the world if you take a seat to edit your video and decide it’s too shaky. In truth, there are several options available to you. In After Effects, there are three options for stabilizing footage. What are they – and how to use <strong>After Effects to</strong> <strong>stabilize footage</strong>? Let’s find out!</p>

In this part, I will show you how to apply Warp Stabilizer to a layer, adjust the effect’s essential parameters, and demonstrate how they work briefly.</p>
<p><strong>Step 1:</strong> The Warp Stabilizer is the most excellent built-in choice for After Effects. This may be found under the Distort tools section of the Effects &amp; Presets panel. You may also go to the effects tab and look for “<strong>Warp</strong>“ in the search box.</p>

                ></p>
<p><strong>Step 2:</strong> When you’ve identified <strong>Warp Stabilizer</strong>, you’ll have to add it to the layer you want to stabilize. You may accomplish this in one of three different ways.

<p><strong>Step 3:</strong> Once you apply the warp stabilizer, it will start immediately. So now, all you have to do is lay back and let the stabilizer do its job.</p>
<p>(Note: The procedure should take no more than a few minutes, and a blue bar will appear across your composition window, indicating that the warp stabilizer is evaluating the film. The composition panel would then display an orange bar, indicating that the effect is applied).</p>

<p>However, as with any good program, third-party plugins could only help you take your work to the next level by adding new features or streamlining your process.</p>
<p>It should be unsurprising that After Effects has many plugins for a program that is over 30 years old. Here are the best stabilization plugins for smoother video in AE:</p>

<p>You would believe that making planets in 3D is simple —create a circle, add textures, and you’re done! Getting a world to ‘look’ properly, on the other hand, might be more complicated than it appears.</p>
<p>For example, how can the line between night and day be altered in a model of a populated planet such that cities may be visible at night but not during the day?</p>
<p>Although Orb doesn’t work for every planetary picture, this would function for 90% of them and is a helpful previs tool. This is particularly true when used in conjunction with other After Effects plugins or paired with a 3D lens from a 3D program, which may be brought into After Effects with background plates for things like spacecraft.</p>

<p><strong>Conclusion</strong></p>
<p>Shaky video footage would be the last thing any video creator wants unless it’s done intentionally for artistic or creative reasons. As a result, they employ methods and equipment to keep the camera safe from any undesired movement.</p>

<p>Video content is becoming increasingly popular; with the proliferation of online content, practically every product now needs its mini-documentary or video clip. Experienced filmmakers and VFX artists used to be the only ones who could get smooth footage. Those days, however, are over.</p>
<p>Adobe After Effects is an excellent tool for smoothing out video footage, in addition to being a great blending and motion animation software; although it’s usually preferable to maintain your film as seamless as possible on location, it’s not the end of the world if you take a seat to edit your video and decide it’s too shaky. In truth, there are several options available to you. In After Effects, there are three options for stabilizing footage. What are they – and how to use <strong>After Effects to</strong> <strong>stabilize footage</strong>? Let’s find out!</p>

In this part, I will show you how to apply Warp Stabilizer to a layer, adjust the effect’s essential parameters, and demonstrate how they work briefly.</p>
<p><strong>Step 1:</strong> The Warp Stabilizer is the most excellent built-in choice for After Effects. This may be found under the Distort tools section of the Effects &amp; Presets panel. You may also go to the effects tab and look for “<strong>Warp</strong>“ in the search box.</p>

<p><strong>Step 2:</strong> When you’ve identified <strong>Warp Stabilizer</strong>, you’ll have to add it to the layer you want to stabilize. You may accomplish this in one of three different ways. You may either drag and drop the filter into the chosen layer in the composing window, place it on the desired layer in the timeline, or double-tap on the effect while selecting your choice footage layer.</p>

<p><strong>Step 2:</strong> When you’ve identified <strong>Warp Stabilizer</strong>, you’ll have to add it to the layer you want to stabilize. You may accomplish this in one of three different ways. You may either drag and drop the filter into the chosen layer in the composing window, place it on the desired layer in the timeline, or double-tap on the effect while selecting your choice footage layer.</p>

<p><strong>Step 3:</strong> Once you apply the warp stabilizer, it will start immediately. So now, all you have to do is lay back and let the stabilizer do its job.</p>
<p>(Note: The procedure should take no more than a few minutes, and a blue bar will appear across your composition window, indicating that the warp stabilizer is evaluating the film. The composition panel would then display an orange bar, indicating that the effect is applied).</p>
<p><strong>Step 4:</strong> After stabilization, use the spacebar to begin a RAM peek. Choose the layer you added to and click to display the drop-down menu or go to the Effects Control panel whenever you need to tweak the stabilizing effect.</p>

<p><strong>Step 1:</strong> The tracker panel is most likely open by default in your edition of After Effects, but if it isn’t, go to <strong>Window</strong> in the top menu to open it. Once you’ve arrived here, scroll to the bottom until you locate <strong>Tracker</strong> and double-check that it has a checkbox beside it.</p>

<p>Although Orb doesn’t work for every planetary picture, this would function for 90% of them and is a helpful previs tool. This is particularly true when used in conjunction with other After Effects plugins or paired with a 3D lens from a 3D program, which may be brought into After Effects with background plates for things like spacecraft.</p>

<p><strong>Conclusion</strong></p>
<p>Shaky video footage would be the last thing any video creator wants unless it’s done intentionally for artistic or creative reasons. As a result, they employ methods and equipment to keep the camera safe from any undesired movement.</p>
<p>However, occasionally those tools aren’t available, and the outcome is questionable. That is why we decided to compile this article to add to the knowledge of our readers how they can use <strong>After Effects to</strong> <strong>stabilize videos</strong> to enhance their video content!</p>

<p>Video content is becoming increasingly popular; with the proliferation of online content, practically every product now needs its mini-documentary or video clip. Experienced filmmakers and VFX artists used to be the only ones who could get smooth footage. Those days, however, are over.</p>
<p>Adobe After Effects is an excellent tool for smoothing out video footage, in addition to being a great blending and motion animation software; although it’s usually preferable to maintain your film as seamless as possible on location, it’s not the end of the world if you take a seat to edit your video and decide it’s too shaky. In truth, there are several options available to you. In After Effects, there are three options for stabilizing footage. What are they – and how to use <strong>After Effects to</strong> <strong>stabilize footage</strong>? Let’s find out!</p>

In this part, I will show you how to apply Warp Stabilizer to a layer, adjust the effect’s essential parameters, and demonstrate how they work briefly.</p>
<p><strong>Step 1:</strong> The Warp Stabilizer is the most excellent built-in choice for After Effects. This may be found under the Distort tools section of the Effects &amp; Presets panel. You may also go to the effects tab and look for “<strong>Warp</strong>“ in the search box.</p>

<p>When you’re learning from a seasoned expert, it’s easy to feel left behind as they go through tools and features you’ve never heard of. On the other hand, the Totally Exposed channel puts such concerns to rest with one-of-a-kind lessons in which we learn with Neil, a novice who has never used FCP X before.</p>
<p>Importing, basic terminologies, cutting clips, and adding music, as well as adding effects, titles, and exporting the finished material, are all covered in this video. It’s more of a trawling movie than a fast instruction at over one hour long. However, it’s ideal for novice users who want to take things a little more slowly and absorb knowledge over time.</p>
<p><strong>Why recommend this channle?</strong></p>
<p>• Extensive yet still very well-paced for beginners.</p>
<p>• Amazing teaching skills.</p>
<p>However, all the video tutorials are quite long because FCPX is powerful but not easy to get started with. You can always choose Wondershare Filmora to boost your editing.</p>

<p>FCP.co is dedicated to all things video on the Mac, focusing on Final Cut Pro X video editing techniques and lessons. They’re continuously updated on the latest FCPX third-party plugins and filters (including many free effects). Unlike Apple’s FCPX user forum, this one is quite active and updated frequently.</p>
<h3 id="2-Apple-Support-Center"><a href="#2-Apple-Support-Center" class="headerlink" title="2.Apple Support Center"></a>2.<a class="link"   target="_blank" rel="noopener" href="https://www.apple.com/final-cut-pro/resources/" >Apple Support Center <i class="fa-regular fa-arrow-up-right-from-square fa-sm"></i></a></h3><p><img

                ></p>
<p>On Apple’s official website, the FCPX support community is active. If you have a specific query regarding the application, this is an excellent resource. The emphasis here is less on editing style, and skill since most content focuses on more technical FCPX software&#x2F;hardware concerns. It’s worth mentioning that if you contribute to the community by assisting other users with their problems rather than just asking questions, your editing karma will skyrocket!</p>

<p>FCPX.tv, with its motto “all things Final Cut Pro X,” is a one-stop shop for the most up-to-date advice and news on this software. An endless list of Final Cut Pro X requests (for future versions and upgrades), FCPX editing lessons, and documentation of known FCPX issues are just a few of the highlights. If you’re an FCPX power editor, this is a must-visit website.</p>

Buying Final Cut Pro lessons gives you the feel of having a personal trainer working alongside you. You can enroll in FCPX paid courses on Udemy and Coursera. Often a certificate of completion is available for download at the end of the course.</p>
<p>However, if you are a beginner, we won’t recommend you buy paid courses. There is unlimited free content related to Final Cut Pro available on YouTube and other websites that you can access without spending a penny.</p>
<p>When you have to spend too much money and energy on an editing tool, consider if it’s really worth it. Rather, you can always choose a much easier yet still powerful editor like Filmora to save your time for better editing.</p>

<p>When you’re learning from a seasoned expert, it’s easy to feel left behind as they go through tools and features you’ve never heard of. On the other hand, the Totally Exposed channel puts such concerns to rest with one-of-a-kind lessons in which we learn with Neil, a novice who has never used FCP X before.</p>
<p>Importing, basic terminologies, cutting clips, and adding music, as well as adding effects, titles, and exporting the finished material, are all covered in this video. It’s more of a trawling movie than a fast instruction at over one hour long. However, it’s ideal for novice users who want to take things a little more slowly and absorb knowledge over time.</p>
<p><strong>Why recommend this channle?</strong></p>
<p>• Extensive yet still very well-paced for beginners.</p>
<p>• Amazing teaching skills.</p>
<p>However, all the video tutorials are quite long because FCPX is powerful but not easy to get started with. You can always choose Wondershare Filmora to boost your editing.</p>

Often a certificate of completion is available for download at the end of the course.</p>
<p>However, if you are a beginner, we won’t recommend you buy paid courses. There is unlimited free content related to Final Cut Pro available on YouTube and other websites that you can access without spending a penny.</p>
<p>When you have to spend too much money and energy on an editing tool, consider if it’s really worth it. Rather, you can always choose a much easier yet still powerful editor like Filmora to save your time for better editing.</p>

<p>When you’re learning from a seasoned expert, it’s easy to feel left behind as they go through tools and features you’ve never heard of. On the other hand, the Totally Exposed channel puts such concerns to rest with one-of-a-kind lessons in which we learn with Neil, a novice who has never used FCP X before.</p>
<p>Importing, basic terminologies, cutting clips, and adding music, as well as adding effects, titles, and exporting the finished material, are all covered in this video. It’s more of a trawling movie than a fast instruction at over one hour long. However, it’s ideal for novice users who want to take things a little more slowly and absorb knowledge over time.</p>
<p><strong>Why recommend this channle?</strong></p>
<p>• Extensive yet still very well-paced for beginners.</p>
<p>• Amazing teaching skills.</p>
<p>However, all the video tutorials are quite long because FCPX is powerful but not easy to get started with. You can always choose Wondershare Filmora to boost your editing.</p>

<p>On Apple’s official website, the FCPX support community is active. If you have a specific query regarding the application, this is an excellent resource. The emphasis here is less on editing style, and skill since most content focuses on more technical FCPX software&#x2F;hardware concerns. It’s worth mentioning that if you contribute to the community by assisting other users with their problems rather than just asking questions, your editing karma will skyrocket!</p>

<p>Did you know your Mac device comes with a built-in speech-to-text feature? So whether you use a laptop or desktop, you can generate text from your voice through your device’s microphone. Officially known as Dictation, the app allows you to transcribe text anywhere you can type it. So, for example, you can use Apple Dictation for your messaging and word processing apps.</p>
<p>The feature has been available since macOS Sierra as a free built-in feature. Earlier versions of Apple Dictation relied on its voice recognition software. However, it now relies on Siri for users of macOS Catalina onwards.</p>
<p>Typically, the app allows you to transcribe thirty seconds and below of audio. However, you can enable Enhanced dictation for longer transcription times. According to most users, the app is suitable for getting the first draft of your assignment, which you can manually edit later.</p>
<p>Follow these steps to enable Apple Dictation on your Mac:</p>
<ol>
<li>Tap the Apple logo on the top-left toolbar of your screen and select <strong>System Preferences</strong> from the resulting menu.</li>
<li>Click on the <strong>Keyboard</strong> option from the system preferences screen.</li>
<li>Once there, click on the <strong>Dictation</strong> option located at the top of the menu.</li>
<li>Select <strong>On</strong> to activate the app in its default mode. In addition, you can check the <strong>Use Enhanced Dictation</strong> box to enable additional functions such as offline use and text commands like bold and italics.</li>
<li>Finally, select your language from the dropdown menu and choose a shortcut key.</li>
</ol>
<p>Please note that you need to speak your punctuation loudly when using Apple Dictation. Otherwise, the app will consider them as regular words.</p>

                ></p>
<p>Another option to consider is speech-to-text Microsoft Word Mac. The app is free to use and relies on Microsoft Azure Speech Services to transcribe text. Below are the requirements to use speech-to-text word mac.</p>
<ul>
<li>An external microphone for your Mac desktop, or you can use your built-in microphone for your MacBook. This is because speech-to-text on Microsoft word mac only allows input with a microphone rather than an audio file upload.</li>
<li>An active Office 365 subscription. Please note you need to log in to your account for the app to function.</li>
<li>Insider builds 16.32 (19120802) and above.</li>
<li>An active internet connection.</li>
</ul>
<p>Once you have everything set up, follow these steps to use speech-to-text on Word.</p>

<p>Dragon Dictate is arguably the best dictation software currently on the market. According to most users, its accuracy and feature sets are next to none. For example, the Smart Format Rules learn how you represent dates, numbers, and abbreviations, resulting in less editing work for you. The Dragon Dictate app is free to download from the Apple Store.</p>
<p>Dragon for Mac users reports a dictation accuracy of nearly 99%, which is excellent in the speech-to-text software category. All of Nuance’s Dragon products use deep learning technology to capture your accent and cadence. As such, the app gets better at transcribing your text as you continue using it. In addition, dragon for Mac professional allows you to transcribe audio clips from uploaded files. For example, you can import audio from your iPhone to your Dragon Dictate workspace and transcribe it hassle-free.</p>
<p>Unfortunately, you cannot get a stand-alone dragon app for Mac. This is because Nuance discontinued its development in 2018. In addition, Microsoft’s acquisition of the company in 2021 proves that the decision is permanent. However, you can still use the Windows version of Dragon through Parallels, which allows you to run macOS and Windows simultaneously. In addition, this method also works for M1 Macs.</p>
