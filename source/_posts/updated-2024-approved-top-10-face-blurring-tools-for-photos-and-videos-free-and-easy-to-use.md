Even though iMovie offers a rich selection of video editing options, unfortunately, there are no options that enable you to blur or pixelate a face.

This is by no means an elegant solution since adding a monochrome rectangle over a video can completely ruin its visual appeal. Using iMovie to conceal faces in videos is only a good option if, for whatever reason, you can't install any other app that grants you more control over the process of blurring faces in videos.

Often a certificate of completion is available for download at the end of the course.

However, if you are a beginner, we won't recommend you buy paid courses. There is unlimited free content related to Final Cut Pro available on YouTube and other websites that you can access without spending a penny.

If you are looking for the best websites to learn Final Cut Pro basics, then you can visit the following web pages:

### 1.[FCP.co](https://fcp.co/)

![the-best-fcpx-tutorial-fcp-co](https://images.wondershare.com/filmora/images/final-cut-pro/the-best-fcpx-tutorial-6.jpg)

FCP.co is dedicated to all things video on the Mac, focusing on Final Cut Pro X video editing techniques and lessons. They're continuously updated on the latest FCPX third-party plugins and filters (including many free effects). Unlike Apple's FCPX user forum, this one is quite active and updated frequently.

### 2.[Apple Support Center](https://www.apple.com/final-cut-pro/resources/)

![the-best-fcpx-tutorial-apple-support-center](https://images.wondershare.com/filmora/images/final-cut-pro/the-best-fcpx-tutorial-7.jpg)

On Apple's official website, the FCPX support community is active. If you have a specific query regarding the application, this is an excellent resource. The emphasis here is less on editing style, and skill since most content focuses on more technical FCPX software/hardware concerns. It's worth mentioning that if you contribute to the community by assisting other users with their problems rather than just asking questions, your editing karma will skyrocket!

### 3.[Reddit](https://www.reddit.com/r/finalcutpro/)

![the-best-fcpx-tutorial-reddit](https://images.wondershare.com/filmora/images/final-cut-pro/the-best-fcpx-tutorial-8.jpg)

If you want to ask a specific question related to Final Cut Pro, you can post it on Reddit. The active community on Reddit will answer it. You can also read the questions posted by other users to increase your knowledge.

![the-best-fcpx-tutorial-fcpx-tv](https://images.wondershare.com/filmora/images/final-cut-pro/the-best-fcpx-tutorial-9.jpg)

FCPX.tv, with its motto "all things Final Cut Pro X," is a one-stop shop for the most up-to-date advice and news on this software. An endless list of Final Cut Pro X requests (for future versions and upgrades), FCPX editing lessons, and documentation of known FCPX issues are just a few of the highlights. If you're an FCPX power editor, this is a must-visit website.

## Part3: Is Paid Class of FCPX Worth For Beginners?

The last thing you want to do with your hectic schedule is sitting through hours of aimless video lessons. Buying Final Cut Pro lessons gives you the feel of having a personal trainer working alongside you. You can enroll in FCPX paid courses on Udemy and Coursera. Often a certificate of completion is available for download at the end of the course.

However, if you are a beginner, we won't recommend you buy paid courses. There is unlimited free content related to Final Cut Pro available on YouTube and other websites that you can access without spending a penny.

When you have to spend too much money and energy on an editing tool, consider if it's really worth it. Rather, you can always choose a much easier yet still powerful editor like Filmora to save your time for better editing.

Importing, basic terminologies, cutting clips, and adding music, as well as adding effects, titles, and exporting the finished material, are all covered in this video.

**Why recommend this channle?**

• Extensive yet still very well-paced for beginners.

• Amazing teaching skills.

However, all the video tutorials are quite long because FCPX is powerful but not easy to get started with. You can always choose Wondershare Filmora to boost your editing.

If you record them in a dim setting, you may find that your movies are excessively dark or of low quality. Recording in low-light conditions may result in a too gloomy video to see clearly and may potentially degrade video quality.

In such cases, utilizing video brightening software on an iPhone or Android might be one of the greatest ways to brighten a video. In addition, we've compiled a list of **Video Brightening Editor App** programs for you on this page. Carefully read the information below to learn more about their characteristics, supported operating systems, and more!

## Part 1: Best Video Editing Apps to Edit Brightness on iPhone and Android

Brightness is important in a clip, whether you realize it or not. Viewers would not sit through a dark video in which they can't see anything. You need the right amount of brightness in your film to make it more engaging and eye-catching. And the apps we've looked at below can help you do just that.

### 1\. [Filmora](https://tools.techidaily.com/wondershare/filmora/download/)

Filmora is a video brightening editing tool made specifically for cellphones. It's simple to use, and even beginners can use it to edit films. Filmora enhances the video's brightness, making it crisper and more vivid.

This application's features include capturing clips, cutting them, adding background music, applying overlays and effects, and more. This popular program also supports Ultra HD resolution. Filmora includes several powerful tools that enable you to put even the most unique and creative ideas into action.

You may make movies, work on music videos, and share the finished products with your pals. This software saves you time while still providing entertainment!

To brighten a video, simply get the app on your phone and install it. Launch the app and select the "+" button to add the video you wish to modify. By clicking on the 5-second mark in the menu settings, you may alter the video's brightness. Click on the "Export" button to save the altered video for later use.

### 2\. [Capcut](https://www.capcut.net/)

Split-screen, vintage, humorous, dreamy, party, and so on are just a few of the various effects available. Those effects add new components to your video, giving it the appearance of being professionally edited. You'll discover sub-categories of effects inside each of these categories, allowing you to fine-tune your changes to obtain the precise one that's suitable for that clip.

To brighten a video, simply tap on the "+" feature in the new Project tab. Import your video. Head over to the Edit section and apply Brightness from the Adjustment section.

### 3\. iMovie

For iPhone and iPad owners, iMovie is the app of choice. YouTubers who wish to edit videos on their phones often use the iOS video editing software. It combines a user-friendly interface with fast performance, ensuring that visual content is never compromised while using a free video editor.

It offers 4K and multi-track editing, a variety of filters, and the ability to incorporate free music that adapts to the duration of a film. To master the iMovie learning curve, you don't need to be an expert in video processing. iMovie's theme library is one of the most prominent features. Each choice includes music, transitions, and text overlays, allowing you to save time and effort when editing.

### 4\. [InShot](https://inshot.com/)

InShot provides all of the options you'll need to improve the quality of your recordings with the brighten video software. Because this is an all-encompassing software, it gives a lot of flexibility and features.

Thanks to many handy features, this video brightness editor tool will make your video editing experience pleasurable and productive. Select the New option from the video menu to alter the brightness.

Next, from your Android phone's gallery, choose the video you would like to brighten up. Now click on the green circle with the checkmark and then on the Filter choice whenever a new screen appears. Change the brightness of the clip using the Brightness function from the filter by moving the sliders.

### 5\. [Videoleap](https://videoleapapp.com/)
