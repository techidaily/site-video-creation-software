**No.2 VLC Media Player -- Robust Open Source MKV Player** 

VLC Media Player is a well-known multi formats video player. Normally this MKV media player shouldn't have problems of playing MKV files as it natively support MKV video playback without installing codec.

However, sometimes when VLC meets H.265 coded MKV files, then [VLC can't play MKV](https://tools.techidaily.com/5kplayer/video-music-player/)and often result in MKV player crashes. In solving this problem, the simplest way is to switch VLC Media Player with the best VLC alternative 5KPlayer, but if you a stubborn VLC fan, you might as well try to convert H.265 to H.264, and then you should be able to play MKV files with VLC trouble free.

**No. 3 Media Player Classic -- MKV Video Player for Windows**

Media Player Classic Home Cinema is another most downloaded MKV file player on Windows. But unfortunately the latest Media Player Classic for Windows 10 has troubles to get embedded MKV subtitles to display when viewing MKV files. Not just MKV playback, problems like video no sound, no image and MPC green screen are also constantly happening in playing other media files. Of course, the main cause of these problem is due to the lack of MKV codec of Media Player Classic, you can download and install Media Player Classic codec pack on your computer and probably reinstall MPC again to try to solve these problems.

### Wiki - What Is MKV?

To find a suitable MKV player, you may need learning some basis of this format: \*.mkv is a filename extension for the Matroska multimedia container format. It is an open standard, future-oriented video file format that is getting more and more popular for high definition videos on the internet, and Matroska has also become a universal format to store high-def multimedia content, such as HD movies and TV shows, attributing to its capability of encapsulating various video, audio, images, subtitle tracks and more into a single file, thus generating MKV files, MKA, MKS, MK3D files respectively and at the same time requiring professional MKV media player to play successfully.

 However, most Windows and Android devices don't natively support MKV files, even some big name media players like VLC Media Player fails thereon, and Windows Media Player can't play MKV video without [MKV Codec for WMP](https://tools.techidaily.com/5kplayer/video-music-player/). Therefore, if you want to play MKV files successfully without messing up with tedious codecs, you need to install a third-party MKV file player.
