That’s why in this article we are going to take you through some of the best free online glitch effect generators you can use to edit photos and videos.

* Powerful text editing tools
* Allows users to upload their fonts
* Offers a broad range of text templates

**Cons**

Once the new page loads, you just have to insert the text into the text boxes and click on the GO button. EPHOTO 360 will then generate the image containing the text you entered.

The Amount, Seed, Iterations, and Quality sliders allow you to fine-tune the glitch effect so that it fits the image you are editing.
