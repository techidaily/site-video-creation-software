It features the drag-n-drop functions and offers almost all the classic video editing functions including trim, rotate, split, combine as well as adding music track, filters, and themes. The windows movie maker is simple yet the function is limited. After you editing one or two vlog videos with it, you will find that.

However,   **Windows Movie Maker** has been discontinued, and it is no longer available for download, but if you are using an older version of the Windows 7 operating system, you can still edit your videos with this iconic PC-based software.

Windows Movie Maker never had much to offer to skilled video editors, so if you take vlogging seriously, you won’t spend too much time editing your videos with it.

![ Windows10 Photos Story Remix feature ](https://images.wondershare.com/filmora/article-images/story-remix.jpg)

**What we like:**

Totally free for windows users and the automatic video creation feature is interesting

**What we don’t like:**

Video Editing Features are limited

Only for Windows users

#### 2. [iMovie](https://www.apple.com/imovie/)

**Price:** Free

**Compatibility:** MacOS and iOS

iMovie is a free video editing software for vloggers who using Mac to edit vidoes. It is equipped with an array of fantastic and practical video editing features, iMovie is an idea video editing tool for anyone. Comes with every new iMac, it's free of charge and provides a wide range of effects and tools sets, thus it's always considered as an essential tool for any Mac user to enhance their vologs.

Despite a somewhat limited scope of video editing features iMovie provides, the software is still powerful enough to enable you to edit footage captured in resolutions up to **4K** . Additionally, you can [create titles](https://tools.techidaily.com/wondershare/filmora/download/), [apply visual effects and filters](https://tools.techidaily.com/wondershare/filmora/download/) to video clips, or even record your own voiceovers. iMovie’s file sharing capabilities are perfectly suited for vlogging as you can upload a video to your YouTube channel or Facebook account directly from the software.

**What we like:**

Totally free for Mac users and you can also use it on iPhone or iPad to edit vlog videos

**What we don’t like:**

Limited features and effects

Only for Mac or iOS users

#### 3. [VSDC Free Video Editor](http://www.videosoftdev.com/free-video-editor)

**Price:** Free

**Compatibility:** Windows

This non-linear editor seems to be a perfect solution for both established and aspiring vloggers because it offers a lot of video editing tools that are incredibly easy to use. Moreover, the software supports nearly all common image and[video file formats](https://tools.techidaily.com/wondershare/filmora/download/) , which means that you can record your vlog entries with any digital camera. The best part is that VSDC enables its users to export videos in HD and 4K resolutions directly to YouTube. The only downside is that you can **only install this vlog editor on a PC computer.**

**What we like:**

Anyone without previous knowledge can use this tool

**What we don’t like:**

Sometimes errors appear when opening the software

#### 4. [GoPro Quik Desktop app](https://itunes.apple.com/us/app/quik-gopro-video-editor/id694164275?mt=8)

**Price:** Free

**Compatibility:** Windows and MacOS

If you're traveling around the world and spend a lot of time on the road shooting videos with a GoPro action camera, then you can try using the Quik desktop app to edit your vlog videos. The Quik video editor is perfectly optimized for editing footage captured with different models of GoPro cameras, but the amount of video editing options the app provides can be a bit underwhelming for professionals. This is a great option if the laptop you carry with you on your journeys doesn’t have enough processing power to run a more powerful video editing software. However, if you rarely use GoPro cameras to record your footage, then this video editing app won’t have a lot to offer you.

**What we like:**

It offers cloud storage

**What we don’t like:**

Some good features are paid and expensive

#### 5. [DaVinci Resolve](https://www.blackmagicdesign.com/products/davinciresolve)

**Price:** Free and premium version

**Compatibility:**  Windows and MacOS

Tools like Filmora and Adobe Premiere are full of great features, but these blessings come with a price. That’s why people love working on DaVinci, as most of its features are free. The good thing is that you can do all sorts of video editing using this software. While this editor is awesome for vlogs, it is already under significant usage in the Hollywood industry.

Although this software has a premium version with additional features, I have found everything I looked for in the free version. That includes color grading, animations, text, and effects. Moreover, it has a customizable and easy interface. But to be honest, you will find it a bit tricky at first. Also, you might need to watch some YouTube tutorials to get started with DaVinci Resolve.

**What we like:**

Complete video production tool with audio post-production options

**What we don’t like:**

4K video editing requires a premium version

#### 6. [VN Video Editor](https://www.vlognow.me/)

**Price:** Free

**Compatibility:** iOS, Android, Mac, and Windows OS

Not many people have heard this name, but VN Video Editor is the best tool for cross-platform operating systems, including iOS and Android. You can also download this tool on your Mac and Windows.

Another fantastic thing about this software is that it’s free and doesn’t even leave a visible watermark on the edited stuff. Furthermore, it doesn’t demand any heavy system requirements whether you’re using it on a smartphone or computer.

You can use this tool on an Apple laptop or computer by downloading this tool from the Apps Store. However, the problem is that you can’t directly download VN Video Editor on your Windows PC. You have to go through a bit of struggle to use it on your system. First, you need to download BluesSacks and then search and install VN Video Editor through Google Play. Here’s a video for your reference.

So, is this struggle worth doing it? Let’s be realistic! I won’t tell you that you can edit an entire Christopher Nolan movie with it, but as a vlogging tool, this has almost everything you will need to make cool videos.

**What we like:**

No watermark and easy to use

**What we don’t like**

No direct download link

Not meant for professional editors

#### 7. [VideoPad](https://www.nchsoftware.com/videopad/index.html)

**Price:**  Free and premium version

**Compatibility:**  Mac and Windows OS

Despite being an old tool, VideoPad is still known to be an excellent pick if you’re looking for free editing software for vlogging. It has a simple interface and is extremely easy to use. Anyone with a bit of interest and knowledge can start editing videos without learning from tutorials.

In my experience, this software is almost similar to Filmora regarding easiness. However, compared to Filmora, it lacks some essential presets. Besides, the interface looks old. But it doesn’t mean that this tool lacks some modern traits.

Furthermore, the editor allows you to export videos in multiple formats, making it great for YouTube videos.

**What we like:**

The free version includes lots of exciting features

Affordable upgrade

**What we don’t like:**

Unable to export mp4 and limited audio tracks in free version

#### 8\. [VideoProc Vlogger](https://www.videoproc.com/video-editing-software/)

A few more features of VideoProc Vlogger include fisheye removal, time-lapse, split screen, green screen, text addition, voice recording, audio extractor, and more.

**What we like:**

Free tech – support

Minor issues with clips splitting

#### 3. [Adobe Premiere Pro](https://www.adobe.com/products/premiere/free-trial-download.html)

**Compatibility:** Windows and MacOS

Adobe Premiere is one of the best video editing apps ever created, if not the best, so if you’re looking for a reliable video editor with plenty of advanced video editing features, this is probably your best choice. The seemingly endless collection of tools, visual effects, and animation features will ensure that each video you edit in Adobe Premiere Pro meets the highest professional standards.

Vloggers in need of a powerful video editing app that is capable of performing even the most demanding video editing tasks will benefit from purchasing Adobe Premiere Pro as a single app or as a part of some other Creative Cloud plan.

It also supports many[third-party plug-ins](https://tools.techidaily.com/wondershare/filmora/download/) for additional features.

A broad spectrum of video editing options grants you the creative freedom to visualize any idea, regardless of how complex that idea may be. However, if you are new to Final Cut Pro, you will   **need a lot of practice in order to be able to utilize its capabilities entirely.**

![final cut pro](https://images.wondershare.com/images/multimedia/video-editor/final-cut-pro-x.jpg "final cut pro")

#### 4. [GoPro Quik Desktop app](https://itunes.apple.com/us/app/quik-gopro-video-editor/id694164275?mt=8)

**Price:** Free

**Compatibility:** Windows and MacOS

If you're traveling around the world and spend a lot of time on the road shooting videos with a GoPro action camera, then you can try using the Quik desktop app to edit your vlog videos. The Quik video editor is perfectly optimized for editing footage captured with different models of GoPro cameras, but the amount of video editing options the app provides can be a bit underwhelming for professionals. This is a great option if the laptop you carry with you on your journeys doesn’t have enough processing power to run a more powerful video editing software.

**What we don’t like:**

Some good features are paid and expensive

#### 5. [DaVinci Resolve](https://www.blackmagicdesign.com/products/davinciresolve)

**Price:** Free and premium version

**Compatibility:**  Windows and MacOS

Tools like Filmora and Adobe Premiere are full of great features, but these blessings come with a price. That’s why people love working on DaVinci, as most of its features are free. The good thing is that you can do all sorts of video editing using this software. While this editor is awesome for vlogs, it is already under significant usage in the Hollywood industry.

Although this software has a premium version with additional features, I have found everything I looked for in the free version. That includes color grading, animations, text, and effects. Moreover, it has a customizable and easy interface. But to be honest, you will find it a bit tricky at first. Also, you might need to watch some YouTube tutorials to get started with DaVinci Resolve.

**What we like:**

Complete video production tool with audio post-production options

**What we don’t like:**

4K video editing requires a premium version

#### 6. [VN Video Editor](https://www.vlognow.me/)

**Price:** Free

**Compatibility:** iOS, Android, Mac, and Windows OS

Another fantastic thing about this software is that it’s free and doesn’t even leave a visible watermark on the edited stuff. Furthermore, it doesn’t demand any heavy system requirements whether you’re using it on a smartphone or computer.

You can use this tool on an Apple laptop or computer by downloading this tool from the Apps Store. However, the problem is that you can’t directly download VN Video Editor on your Windows PC. You have to go through a bit of struggle to use it on your system. First, you need to download BluesSacks and then search and install VN Video Editor through Google Play. Here’s a video for your reference.

So, is this struggle worth doing it? Let’s be realistic! I won’t tell you that you can edit an entire Christopher Nolan movie with it, but as a vlogging tool, this has almost everything you will need to make cool videos.

**What we like:**

No watermark and easy to use

In my experience, this software is almost similar to Filmora regarding easiness. However, compared to Filmora, it lacks some essential presets. Besides, the interface looks old. But it doesn’t mean that this tool lacks some modern traits.

Furthermore, the editor allows you to export videos in multiple formats, making it great for YouTube videos.

**What we like:**

Unable to export mp4 and limited audio tracks in free version

## Say Goodbye to Typing: Best Mac Speech-to-Text Apps You Can Use Right Away [Free & No Download Necessary]

Do you struggle to meet deadlines for your text assignments? If you do, then you are in luck. Speech recognition technology is the best way to beat this challenge. Whether you are a student or a corporate professional, several speech-to-text apps can be used to guarantee that you meet your deadlines. For example, Mac owners can use dragon for Mac to complete typing assignments in half the time.

Below are the best speech-to-text apps on Mac you might have missed since the beginning of 2022\. Some of the apps in the list are in-built into your device, while others may require you to download additional software. Regardless, all of those listed below are free to use on your Mac device. Keep reading to find out more.

## Part1: Top 1 Built-in Mac Dictation Feature

![top 1](https://images.wondershare.com/filmora/article-images/2022/08/dragon-for-mac-1.jpg)

Did you know your Mac device comes with a built-in speech-to-text feature? So whether you use a laptop or desktop, you can generate text from your voice through your device's microphone. Officially known as Dictation, the app allows you to transcribe text anywhere you can type it. So, for example, you can use Apple Dictation for your messaging and word processing apps.

The feature has been available since macOS Sierra as a free built-in feature. Earlier versions of Apple Dictation relied on its voice recognition software. However, it now relies on Siri for users of macOS Catalina onwards.

Typically, the app allows you to transcribe thirty seconds and below of audio. However, you can enable Enhanced dictation for longer transcription times. According to most users, the app is suitable for getting the first draft of your assignment, which you can manually edit later.

Follow these steps to enable Apple Dictation on your Mac:

1. Tap the Apple logo on the top-left toolbar of your screen and select **System Preferences** from the resulting menu.
2. Click on the **Keyboard** option from the system preferences screen.
3. Once there, click on the **Dictation** option located at the top of the menu.
4. Select **On** to activate the app in its default mode. In addition, you can check the **Use Enhanced Dictation** box to enable additional functions such as offline use and text commands like bold and italics.
5. Finally, select your language from the dropdown menu and choose a shortcut key.

Please note that you need to speak your punctuation loudly when using Apple Dictation. Otherwise, the app will consider them as regular words.

## Part2: Top 2 Microsoft Word \[Free & No Download\]

![top 2](https://images.wondershare.com/filmora/article-images/2022/08/dragon-for-mac-2.jpg)

Another option to consider is speech-to-text Microsoft Word Mac. The app is free to use and relies on Microsoft Azure Speech Services to transcribe text. Below are the requirements to use speech-to-text word mac.

* An external microphone for your Mac desktop, or you can use your built-in microphone for your MacBook. This is because speech-to-text on Microsoft word mac only allows input with a microphone rather than an audio file upload.
* An active Office 365 subscription. Please note you need to log in to your account for the app to function.
* Insider builds 16.32 (19120802) and above.
* An active internet connection.

Once you have everything set up, follow these steps to use speech-to-text on Word.

1. Launch Microsoft Word from your desktop.
2. Click on the **Dictate** button from the top menu of your Word document, and wait for the red dot to appear. The button features a microphone for easy identification.
3. Once the dot appears, start speaking to transcribe your text. Ensure you are in a quiet environment for the best results. In addition, speak louder when transcribing punctuations.
4. Click on the Dictate button to finish the transcription.

## Part3: Top 3 Google docs

![top 3](https://images.wondershare.com/filmora/article-images/2022/08/dragon-for-mac-3.jpg)

Google Docs is arguably the market's most accurate free speech-to-text service. In addition, it allows you to transcribe your voice to text and format documents with your voice. However, you can only use the service through the Chrome browser.

Follow these steps to activate Google Docs voice typing on your Mac device:

1. Launch the **Chrome** browser on your macOS and select **Docs** from the app menu. Please note you will need an active Google account to use the service.
2. Open a new document and click on the **Tools** tab from the top menu.
3. Select **Voice Typing** from the menu to access speech-to-text on Google Docs.
4. Tap the microphone to start transcribing, and tap it again to finish.

Google Docs speech-to-text is available in 71 languages. In addition, it supports simple commands such as 'create a bulleted list,' which are unavailable on other speech-to-text apps. As such, it is one of the market's most popular voice typing apps.

## Part5: Top 5 Dragon for Mac

![top 5](https://images.wondershare.com/filmora/article-images/2022/08/dragon-for-mac-5.jpg)

Dragon Dictate is arguably the best dictation software currently on the market. According to most users, its accuracy and feature sets are next to none. For example, the Smart Format Rules learn how you represent dates, numbers, and abbreviations, resulting in less editing work for you. The Dragon Dictate app is free to download from the Apple Store.

Dragon for Mac users reports a dictation accuracy of nearly 99%, which is excellent in the speech-to-text software category. All of Nuance's Dragon products use deep learning technology to capture your accent and cadence. As such, the app gets better at transcribing your text as you continue using it. In addition, dragon for Mac professional allows you to transcribe audio clips from uploaded files. For example, you can import audio from your iPhone to your Dragon Dictate workspace and transcribe it hassle-free.

Unfortunately, you cannot get a stand-alone dragon app for Mac. This is because Nuance discontinued its development in 2018\. In addition, Microsoft's acquisition of the company in 2021 proves that the decision is permanent. However, you can still use the Windows version of Dragon through Parallels, which allows you to run macOS and Windows simultaneously. In addition, this method also works for M1 Macs.

## Part6: FAQs

### Is there a difference between voice recognition and speech-to-text?

Voice recognition software allows your device to capture your accent and tone and then stores that data for different functions, such as user logins and speech-to-text functionality. For example, Siri will ask you to repeat a sentence several times as one of the setup steps.

### Which is the best external device for the speech-to-text service?

Most users report better speech-to-text accuracy when using headsets compared to using an external microphone. This is because the microphone is much closer to your mouth, so your voice is less affected by external noise.

### Can speech-to-text apps automatically translate a transcribed text?

Yes, they can. Apps such as Google's Speech to Text include a translation feature in their functionality. However, you will need the Google Chrome browser to access Speech to text. This is because the service is only available to active google account holders.

### How much faster is speech to text faster than typing?

A 2017 Stanford study states that speech to text is about[three times faster than typing](https://dl.acm.org/doi/10.1145/3161187). In addition, it found that speech-to-text apps can transcribe over 150 words per minute, while professional transcriptionists range between 50 to 80 words per minute.
