## Apple's Finest: Top Video Editing Software for Mac Users

Apple is widely known for its iPhone, iPad, and Macitonsh computer around the world, but do you know that it also provides some fantastic video editing software for creators? In this article, we've compiled a list of the best **Apple** **video** **editing** software on the market right now, including free, freemium, and premium solutions.

With these apps, you can modify videos on your smartphones or computers easily. And if you've invested in an iPhone 13 Pro or iPhone 13 Pro Max that can capture video in the high-resolution ProRes standard, you'll find reliable software to make the most of your video. We'll go over which applications are excellent for specific chores and provide statistics to help you discover the best match. Let's get started!

## Apple Apps for Video Editing You Should Try

In today's world, photos and videos are an integral part of everyone's life. Mobile phones, laptops, and cameras may all be used to capture them. But, it might not be easy to organize and decorate them according to one's unique preferences. Fortunately, there are several tools available to help Apple users with these tasks.

In the following part, I will introduce 5 best apple video editing software, including its unique features listed.

### 1\. Photos

**Supported By:** iOS/macOS/iPadOS

**Pricing:** Free to use

The number one on our list is the Photos app. It's among the most well-known application for video editing enthusiasts in the iOS community. This is an application mostly used by professional designers and developers who are into the video editing profession.

**What Can You Do with Photos App?**

Apple Inc. created Photos, a picture storage and editing program. Its main features are its simplicity and ease of usage. Its very name is a lovely and obvious indication of its use. Since 2015, this Mac picture editing app has been offered for OS X Yosemite 10.10.3 and tvOS v.10.

Filters and Smart Sliders are among the editing tools available in this program. It also has the Mark-up tool that allows you to **add text**, shapes, and doodles, as well as signatures. What’s more, you can **rotate, crop and auto enhance** videos in this app as well. Like photos editing, if you are not satisfied with the editing, you can tap **Revert** to restore to the original version.

If you are using the Photos app on iPhone 13 and iPhone 13 Pro, you can **adjust the focus points and the depth of the field** in Cinematic mode to make a cinematic-looking video easily.

* **Edit Videos Anywhere with iCloud Photo Library**

The connection with iCloud Picture Library is where Photos outperforms every other Mac image editing tool. This fantastic feature allows users to fill out their libraries rather than their devices. This is accomplished by syncing photographs and videos across all Apple devices, including the iPhone, iPad, Apple TV, MacBook and Apple Watch.

* **Moments**

Photos employs Moments as an organizer, which may be used to build categories and years. Moments are a mix of the photo's time and location information. Furthermore, facial recognition enables users to create groups based on a person, among other things.

* **Themes**

Themes, which allow users to make calendars, picture albums, and other projects, complement the modifying and organizing capabilities. The program also provides printing capabilities for professional results.

### 2\. QuickTime Player

**Supported By:** iOS/macOS/iPad

**Pricing:** Free to use

Next on our list is the QuickTime Player that lets you do almost whatever you want to do with your videos and pictures. The app is built to support both beginners and professionals. However, we would lean more towards beginners because most professionals today prefer apps like iMovie or Final Cut Pro. But that's not to say this one doesn't have excellent features to offer.

**What Can You Do with QuickTime Player App?**

* **Trim, Combine,** **Rotate, Split MOV Video**

Everyone wants to make their lengthy videos short. QuickTime allows you to do precisely that with its trimming feature. Make your videos short and catchy with this feature. Further, you can combine two videos to make one excellent video for your presentation. The app also allows you to split different videos and combine them to produce more quality content.

* **Record Screen and Voiceover**

If you think your video footage can do well with a background voiceover of someone else, QuickTime Player allows you to record your audios in the background while your video plays smoothly. You can also record the desktop screen with the Player.
