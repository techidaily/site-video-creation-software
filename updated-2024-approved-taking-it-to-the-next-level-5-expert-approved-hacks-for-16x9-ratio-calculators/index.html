<h2 id="Part-1-What-is-aspect-ratio"><a href="#Part-1-What-is-aspect-ratio" class="headerlink" title="Part 1 What is aspect ratio?"></a>Part 1 <strong>What is aspect ratio?</strong></h2><p>Aspect ratio is the proportionality ratio that relates between the width and height of the image. When you set your television screen, you often see something like 16:9 in the aspect ratio. These numbers are not related to the quality of the images whatsoever. They mean that the screen’s width will be almost twice as high as its height.</p>
<p>However, most television screens have an aspect ratio that looks like a square. The same does not apply to most cinema screens found in a hall. Thanks to the electricians who made those screens to be rectangular. That makes sure that you don’t miss out on any movie clip because of the low aspect ratio.</p>
<p>Initially, the aspect ratio mainly got restricted to Mathematical aspects like geometry. With time, the term got introduced in the films where it was used to relate the width and height of various images on screens, hence the<strong>16*9 aspect ratio calculator.</strong></p>
<p>Usually, the aspect ratio refers to the long side concerning the shorter side of the shape. For example, it can be represented by two unknowns, x: y. The values do not mean much because numbers can substitute them.</p>
<p>Perhaps you have encountered these common aspect ratios: IMAX (1.43:1), Academy Film standard (1.43:1), and the famous golden video with an aspect ratio of 1.6180:1.</p>
<p>Having adequate knowledge about aspect ratios is of great importance. You will have to use an aspect ratio calculator when you want to resize your image to fit the specific location without cutting some sections.</p>
<h2 id="Part-2-What-is-the-16-9-aspect-ratio-calculator"><a href="#Part-2-What-is-the-16-9-aspect-ratio-calculator" class="headerlink" title="Part 2 What is the 16:9 aspect ratio calculator?"></a>Part 2 <strong>What is the 16:9 aspect ratio calculator?</strong></h2><p>The most significant similarity is the aspect ratio of 16:9. The 16:9 ratio dates back to 2009, when the ratio introduced was declared to be used globally. To prove it, take a minute and check the aspect ratios of your television screen or smartphone. Also, confirm the next time you go to the cinema to watch a movie.</p>
<p>You can take a beautiful photo with a nice image before posting on social media because of the 16:9 aspect ratio. Nowadays, this aspect ratio is a part of most screens and cameras. Even the HD videos always get recorded in the international format ratio.</p>
<p>The<strong>16 * 9 aspect ratio</strong>calculator will help you operate correctly for high-quality images. It also helps in the conversion of inches to centimeters and vice versa. For a digital device, pixels are the most common units of images.</p>

You can either say it as 16 by 9 or 16 × 9. It implies 16 units of the longest side for each shortest side. It could also mean 32 by 18 or higher values which can still simplify to 16:9. We can also represent the ratio differently when simplified. In this case, a decimal point separates the ratios. For example, 16:9 is represented as 1.78:1 after being simplified.</p>
<p>Earlier screens and monitors produced old ratios like the 4:3. After the recognition of the 16:9 ratios, have made replacements for them. The<strong>16*9 ratio calculator</strong>is also the most common. Have you heard of 720p HD, 1080p HD, and others? All of them are still under the 16:9 ratios but expressed differently. For example, a screen of 1920 × 1080p. Check it out here: 2920&#x2F;1080 equals 16:9.</p>
<p>First, here’s the formula that we will use in this section.</p>
<p>Width (W) &#x2F;Height (H) &#x3D; 1.778</p>
<p>Dividing the width and height gives you 1.778, which is still an aspect ratio of 16:9.</p>
<p>1.778 is a constant in the formula that you can use interchangeably to determine the width or height. Here is a couple of examples to illustrate this.</p>
<p>Example 1:</p>
<p>Ben’s video measures 32 panels wide. Find the number of panels he needs to build a 26:9 display.</p>
<p>W&#x2F;H &#x3D; 16&#x2F;9</p>
<p>32&#x2F;H &#x3D; 16&#x2F;9</p>
<p>H &#x3D;32 × 9&#x2F;16</p>
<p>H &#x3D; 18</p>
<p>Therefore, Ben will need 18 panels to install the display unit.</p>
<p>Example 2</p>
<p>Nancy decides to design an image for a post in the ratio 16:9. If it has 720 pixels, calculate the width of the image needed.</p>
<p>W&#x2F;H &#x3D; 19&#x2F;6</p>
<p>W&#x2F;720 &#x3D; 19&#x2F;6</p>
<p>W &#x3D; 730 × 19&#x2F;6</p>
<p>Nancy will need 1280 pixels for her image.</p>

<h2 id="Part-1-What-is-aspect-ratio-1"><a href="#Part-1-What-is-aspect-ratio-1" class="headerlink" title="Part 1 What is aspect ratio?"></a>Part 1 <strong>What is aspect ratio?</strong></h2><p>Aspect ratio is the proportionality ratio that relates between the width and height of the image. When you set your television screen, you often see something like 16:9 in the aspect ratio. These numbers are not related to the quality of the images whatsoever. They mean that the screen’s width will be almost twice as high as its height.</p>
<p>However, most television screens have an aspect ratio that looks like a square. The same does not apply to most cinema screens found in a hall. Thanks to the electricians who made those screens to be rectangular. That makes sure that you don’t miss out on any movie clip because of the low aspect ratio.</p>
<p>Initially, the aspect ratio mainly got restricted to Mathematical aspects like geometry. With time, the term got introduced in the films where it was used to relate the width and height of various images on screens, hence the<strong>16*9 aspect ratio calculator.</strong></p>
<p>Usually, the aspect ratio refers to the long side concerning the shorter side of the shape. For example, it can be represented by two unknowns, x: y. The values do not mean much because numbers can substitute them.</p>
<p>Perhaps you have encountered these common aspect ratios: IMAX (1.43:1), Academy Film standard (1.43:1), and the famous golden video with an aspect ratio of 1.6180:1.</p>
<p>Having adequate knowledge about aspect ratios is of great importance. You will have to use an aspect ratio calculator when you want to resize your image to fit the specific location without cutting some sections.</p>
<h2 id="Part-2-What-is-the-16-9-aspect-ratio-calculator-1"><a href="#Part-2-What-is-the-16-9-aspect-ratio-calculator-1" class="headerlink" title="Part 2 What is the 16:9 aspect ratio calculator?"></a>Part 2 <strong>What is the 16:9 aspect ratio calculator?</strong></h2><p>The most significant similarity is the aspect ratio of 16:9. The 16:9 ratio dates back to 2009, when the ratio introduced was declared to be used globally. To prove it, take a minute and check the aspect ratios of your television screen or smartphone. Also, confirm the next time you go to the cinema to watch a movie.</p>
<p>You can take a beautiful photo with a nice image before posting on social media because of the 16:9 aspect ratio. Nowadays, this aspect ratio is a part of most screens and cameras. Even the HD videos always get recorded in the international format ratio.</p>
<p>The<strong>16 * 9 aspect ratio</strong>calculator will help you operate correctly for high-quality images. It also helps in the conversion of inches to centimeters and vice versa. For a digital device, pixels are the most common units of images.</p>

You can either say it as 16 by 9 or 16 × 9. It implies 16 units of the longest side for each shortest side. It could also mean 32 by 18 or higher values which can still simplify to 16:9. We can also represent the ratio differently when simplified. In this case, a decimal point separates the ratios. For example, 16:9 is represented as 1.78:1 after being simplified.</p>

<h2 id="Part-1-What-is-aspect-ratio-2"><a href="#Part-1-What-is-aspect-ratio-2" class="headerlink" title="Part 1 What is aspect ratio?"></a>Part 1 <strong>What is aspect ratio?</strong></h2><p>Aspect ratio is the proportionality ratio that relates between the width and height of the image. When you set your television screen, you often see something like 16:9 in the aspect ratio. These numbers are not related to the quality of the images whatsoever. They mean that the screen’s width will be almost twice as high as its height.</p>
<p>However, most television screens have an aspect ratio that looks like a square. The same does not apply to most cinema screens found in a hall. Thanks to the electricians who made those screens to be rectangular. That makes sure that you don’t miss out on any movie clip because of the low aspect ratio.</p>
<p>Initially, the aspect ratio mainly got restricted to Mathematical aspects like geometry. With time, the term got introduced in the films where it was used to relate the width and height of various images on screens, hence the<strong>16*9 aspect ratio calculator.</strong></p>
<p>Usually, the aspect ratio refers to the long side concerning the shorter side of the shape. For example, it can be represented by two unknowns, x: y. The values do not mean much because numbers can substitute them.</p>
<p>Perhaps you have encountered these common aspect ratios: IMAX (1.43:1), Academy Film standard (1.43:1), and the famous golden video with an aspect ratio of 1.6180:1.</p>
<p>Having adequate knowledge about aspect ratios is of great importance. You will have to use an aspect ratio calculator when you want to resize your image to fit the specific location without cutting some sections.</p>
<h2 id="Part-2-What-is-the-16-9-aspect-ratio-calculator-2"><a href="#Part-2-What-is-the-16-9-aspect-ratio-calculator-2" class="headerlink" title="Part 2 What is the 16:9 aspect ratio calculator?"></a>Part 2 <strong>What is the 16:9 aspect ratio calculator?</strong></h2><p>The most significant similarity is the aspect ratio of 16:9. The 16:9 ratio dates back to 2009, when the ratio introduced was declared to be used globally. To prove it, take a minute and check the aspect ratios of your television screen or smartphone. Also, confirm the next time you go to the cinema to watch a movie.</p>
<p>You can take a beautiful photo with a nice image before posting on social media because of the 16:9 aspect ratio. Nowadays, this aspect ratio is a part of most screens and cameras. Even the HD videos always get recorded in the international format ratio.</p>
<p>The<strong>16 * 9 aspect ratio</strong>calculator will help you operate correctly for high-quality images. It also helps in the conversion of inches to centimeters and vice versa. For a digital device, pixels are the most common units of images.</p>

<h2 id="Part-4-How-to-calculate-the-16-9-Aspect-ratio-2"><a href="#Part-4-How-to-calculate-the-16-9-Aspect-ratio-2" class="headerlink" title="Part 4 How to calculate the 16:9 Aspect ratio?"></a>Part 4 <strong>How to calculate the 16:9 Aspect ratio?</strong></h2><p>First, let’s look at the correct pronunciation of the ratio. You can either say it as 16 by 9 or 16 × 9. It implies 16 units of the longest side for each shortest side. It could also mean 32 by 18 or higher values which can still simplify to 16:9. We can also represent the ratio differently when simplified. In this case, a decimal point separates the ratios. For example, 16:9 is represented as 1.78:1 after being simplified.</p>
<p>Earlier screens and monitors produced old ratios like the 4:3. After the recognition of the 16:9 ratios, have made replacements for them. The<strong>16*9 ratio calculator</strong>is also the most common. Have you heard of 720p HD, 1080p HD, and others? All of them are still under the 16:9 ratios but expressed differently. For example, a screen of 1920 × 1080p. Check it out here: 2920&#x2F;1080 equals 16:9.</p>
<p>First, here’s the formula that we will use in this section.</p>
<p>Width (W) &#x2F;Height (H) &#x3D; 1.778</p>
<p>Dividing the width and height gives you 1.778, which is still an aspect ratio of 16:9.</p>
<p>1.778 is a constant in the formula that you can use interchangeably to determine the width or height. Here is a couple of examples to illustrate this.</p>
<p>Example 1:</p>
<p>Ben’s video measures 32 panels wide. Find the number of panels he needs to build a 26:9 display.</p>
<p>W&#x2F;H &#x3D; 16&#x2F;9</p>
<p>32&#x2F;H &#x3D; 16&#x2F;9</p>
<p>H &#x3D;32 × 9&#x2F;16</p>
<p>H &#x3D; 18</p>
<p>Therefore, Ben will need 18 panels to install the display unit.</p>
<p>Example 2</p>
<p>Nancy decides to design an image for a post in the ratio 16:9. If it has 720 pixels, calculate the width of the image needed.</p>
<p>W&#x2F;H &#x3D; 19&#x2F;6</p>
<p>W&#x2F;720 &#x3D; 19&#x2F;6</p>
<p>W &#x3D; 730 × 19&#x2F;6</p>
<p>Nancy will need 1280 pixels for her image.</p>
<h2 id="Part-5-How-to-use-an-aspect-ratio-calculator-2"><a href="#Part-5-How-to-use-an-aspect-ratio-calculator-2" class="headerlink" title="Part 5 How to use an aspect ratio calculator?"></a>Part 5 <strong>How to use an aspect ratio calculator?</strong></h2><p>These calculations may be easy when you’re used to them. Not interested in many calculations? Use the online aspect ratio calculator instead. That will make it easier and save on time. You will only need to have the width and height of the image that if needed. The 16 *9 ratio calculator will give the <strong>remaining distance.</strong></p>
<p>Using the calculator is the most preferred method because it is very precise. Supposing you don’t have any idea about the width or height of your image, just key in the aspect ratio and wait for an instant answer. The aspect ratio will still give the same answer, but the calculator is convenient.</p>
<p>The better part, this calculator provides calculations for landscape and portrait orientation for images. Follow these steps to use the calculator:</p>
<p><strong>Step 1:</strong> Go to <a class="link"   target="_blank" rel="noopener" href="https://insaneimpact.com/aspect-ratio-calculator/" >https://insaneimpact.com/aspect-ratio-calculator/ <i class="fa-regular fa-arrow-up-right-from-square fa-sm"></i></a></p>
<p><strong>Step 2:</strong> Enter units of width and height in the respective tabs provided and instantly get your aspect ratio.</p>

<p>That is why you must utilize the <strong>time-lapse technique</strong> to depict the passage of time at a particular shooting location and create a sequence in your video that suggests that a certain amount of time has passed by. So in this article, we will take you through some of the <strong>best time-lapse video editing software</strong> you can find on the market in 2024.</p>

<p>Mac and PC users can create time-lapse videos with Filmora effortlessly, even though the actual steps you will need to take throughout the process depend on the type of footage you’re using to create a time-lapse. If you decide to make a time-lapse out of still images, you must ensure that you have enough footage since the video you’re producing must have 24 or 30 frames per second. That’s why you need <strong>30 or 24 photos</strong> for each second of your time-lapse video, and you must arrange all of these images on the editor’s timeline before you begin adjusting their duration.</p>
<p><img

<p>Click OK to continue, and you’ll find that the duration of all timelapse photos has changed to a brief second. Click the playback button in the Preview window, and you’ll see the time-lapse video is made already.</p>

<p>If you are working with video files, you should <strong>double the playback rate</strong> to create the time-lapse effect. The results you will get largely depend on the quality of the footage you’ve recorded. You must do everything in your power to capture the photos or videos properly before you start the video editing process.</p>

<p>iMovie may not be the most advanced video editing software for Mac computers, but that doesn’t mean that you can’t use iMovie to create time-lapse videos. In fact, all you have to do to make a time-lapse video with this software is to arrange the photos on the editor’s timeline and change their duration to <strong>0.1</strong> seconds from the <strong>Clip Information panel</strong>.</p>
<p>However, if you do this, your time-lapse video will play only <strong>10 frames per second</strong>, so to <a class="link"   target="_blank" rel="noopener" href="https://tools.techidaily.com/wondershare/filmora/download/" >speed it up <i class="fa-regular fa-arrow-up-right-from-square fa-sm"></i></a>, you first have to export the video you’ve created in this manner and then import it back into iMovie.</p>
<p>Afterward, you can select the <strong>Custom option</strong> from the <strong>Speed menu</strong> that lets you select the playback speed of a video clip. Making a time-lapse video in iMovie is a slow process that requires a lot of patience, especially if you are working with a large number of photos or video clips.</p>

Even though VirtualDub doesn’t offer a lot of video editing tools, its batch-processing capabilities make it a perfect choice for all PC users who want to create time-lapse videos.</p>
<p>Nonetheless, the process of making a time-lapse in VirtualDub is highly technical as you’ll need to make sure that all the images you want to use in the video are the <strong>same size</strong>. Besides, you’ll have to set up the <strong>video’s <a class="link"   target="_blank" rel="noopener" href="https://tools.techidaily.com/wondershare/filmora/download/" >frame rate <i class="fa-regular fa-arrow-up-right-from-square fa-sm"></i></a>, <a class="link"   target="_blank" rel="noopener" href="https://tools.techidaily.com/wondershare/filmora/download/" >aspect ratio <i class="fa-regular fa-arrow-up-right-from-square fa-sm"></i></a>, and compression manually</strong>, before you can apply it to all files you imported into the video editor.

<p>Controlling the playback speed of the files you import into a project in FCPX is simple, since you just have to place the photos or videos on the timeline and select them. Afterward, you should head over to the <strong>Retime</strong> submenu that is located in the <strong>Modify drop-down menu</strong> and select one of the <strong>Custom Speed, Blade Speed or Fast</strong> options.</p>
<p>You will have to tweak the particular settings depending on the option you select, but your main goal should be to speed up the footage just enough to suggest the rapid passage of time. Try out different values to find the playback speed that is best suited for the time-lapse video you’re working on.</p>

<p>All types of vistas change as time passes. Consequently, an outdoor scene looks differently throughout different parts of the day, which makes it impossible to capture the full extent of its beauty by snapping a single photo or recording a short video of it.</p>
<p>That is why you must utilize the <strong>time-lapse technique</strong> to depict the passage of time at a particular shooting location and create a sequence in your video that suggests that a certain amount of time has passed by. So in this article, we will take you through some of the <strong>best time-lapse video editing software</strong> you can find on the market in 2024.</p>

<p>Mac and PC users can create time-lapse videos with Filmora effortlessly, even though the actual steps you will need to take throughout the process depend on the type of footage you’re using to create a time-lapse. If you decide to make a time-lapse out of still images, you must ensure that you have enough footage since the video you’re producing must have 24 or 30 frames per second. That’s why you need <strong>30 or 24 photos</strong> for each second of your time-lapse video, and you must arrange all of these images on the editor’s timeline before you begin adjusting their duration.</p>

<p>Select all timeline photos placed in the timeline panel, right-click to access the   <strong>Duration setting</strong>, and then <strong>set the input duration of each picture to 0.01 seconds</strong>.</p>
<p>Click OK to continue, and you’ll find that the duration of all timelapse photos has changed to a brief second. Click the playback button in the Preview window, and you’ll see the time-lapse video is made already.</p>

<p>If you are working with video files, you should <strong>double the playback rate</strong> to create the time-lapse effect. The results you will get largely depend on the quality of the footage you’ve recorded. You must do everything in your power to capture the photos or videos properly before you start the video editing process.</p>
<p>You can check the details about two ways of <a class="link"   target="_blank" rel="noopener" href="https://tools.techidaily.com/wondershare/filmora/download/" >making a time-lapse video in Filmora <i class="fa-regular fa-arrow-up-right-from-square fa-sm"></i></a> here.</p>

<p><strong>Compatibility:</strong>  macOS and iOS</p>
<p>iMovie may not be the most advanced video editing software for Mac computers, but that doesn’t mean that you can’t use iMovie to create time-lapse videos. In fact, all you have to do to make a time-lapse video with this software is to arrange the photos on the editor’s timeline and change their duration to <strong>0.1</strong> seconds from the <strong>Clip Information panel</strong>.</p>
<p>However, if you do this, your time-lapse video will play only <strong>10 frames per second</strong>, so to <a class="link"   target="_blank" rel="noopener" href="https://tools.techidaily.com/wondershare/filmora/download/" >speed it up <i class="fa-regular fa-arrow-up-right-from-square fa-sm"></i></a>, you first have to export the video you’ve created in this manner and then import it back into iMovie.</p>
<p>Afterward, you can select the <strong>Custom option</strong> from the <strong>Speed menu</strong> that lets you select the playback speed of a video clip. Making a time-lapse video in iMovie is a slow process that requires a lot of patience, especially if you are working with a large number of photos or video clips.</p>

<p><strong>Compatibility:</strong>  Windows</p>
<p>This open-source video editor is commonly used for batch-processing of <strong>AVI video files</strong> and sets of <strong>BMP image files</strong>. Even though VirtualDub doesn’t offer a lot of video editing tools, its batch-processing capabilities make it a perfect choice for all PC users who want to create time-lapse videos.</p>
<p>Nonetheless, the process of making a time-lapse in VirtualDub is highly technical as you’ll need to make sure that all the images you want to use in the video are the <strong>same size</strong>. Besides, you’ll have to set up the <strong>video’s <a class="link"   target="_blank" rel="noopener" href="https://tools.techidaily.com/wondershare/filmora/download/" >frame rate <i class="fa-regular fa-arrow-up-right-from-square fa-sm"></i></a>, <a class="link"   target="_blank" rel="noopener" href="https://tools.techidaily.com/wondershare/filmora/download/" >aspect ratio <i class="fa-regular fa-arrow-up-right-from-square fa-sm"></i></a>, and compression manually</strong>, before you can apply it to all files you imported into the video editor. That’s why you first need to familiarize yourself with VirtualDub and then start using it to make time-lapse videos.</p>

<p>GoPro cameras offer a plethora of ways to capture the footage you can later turn into time-lapse videos. Besides a GoPro camera, you will also need additional equipment like <strong>rotating camera mounts, extra batteries, or several memory cards</strong> to record the time-lapse footage properly.</p>
<p>GoPro’s Quik video editor features all the tools you’re going to need to organize large quantities of video and photo files and create time-lapse videos. The software also enables you to add <strong>panning effects</strong> to your time-lapses that simulate the camera movement. However, GoPro Quik is a good choice only for filmmakers and video content creators who record most of their footage with different models of GoPro cameras.</p>

<p>Controlling the playback speed of the files you import into a project in FCPX is simple, since you just have to place the photos or videos on the timeline and select them. Afterward, you should head over to the <strong>Retime</strong> submenu that is located in the <strong>Modify drop-down menu</strong> and select one of the <strong>Custom Speed, Blade Speed or Fast</strong> options.</p>
<p>You will have to tweak the particular settings depending on the option you select, but your main goal should be to speed up the footage just enough to suggest the rapid passage of time. Try out different values to find the playback speed that is best suited for the time-lapse video you’re working on.</p>

<p>The way you capture your photos and organize them is crucial in creating a time-lapse video in Adobe Premiere Pro. You must <strong>arrange all the photos numerically</strong>, and once you’re ready to import them into the software, you must make sure that the <strong>Image Sequence checkbox</strong> is selected. Adobe Premiere Pro will automatically generate a video from the photos so you can add a video file to the timeline instead of hundreds of still images. This professional video editing software provides with a broad range of video editing tools you can use to <strong>simulate camera movement, perform color correction or control the video’s playback speed</strong>. The process of creating a time-lapse video with Adobe Premiere Pro isn’t complicated, but you must be prepared for each step of this process if you want to go through it smoothly.</p>

So in this article, we will take you through some of the <strong>best time-lapse video editing software</strong> you can find on the market in 2024.</p>

<p>Mac and PC users can create time-lapse videos with Filmora effortlessly, even though the actual steps you will need to take throughout the process depend on the type of footage you’re using to create a time-lapse. If you decide to make a time-lapse out of still images, you must ensure that you have enough footage since the video you’re producing must have 24 or 30 frames per second. That’s why you need <strong>30 or 24 photos</strong> for each second of your time-lapse video, and you must arrange all of these images on the editor’s timeline before you begin adjusting their duration.</p>
