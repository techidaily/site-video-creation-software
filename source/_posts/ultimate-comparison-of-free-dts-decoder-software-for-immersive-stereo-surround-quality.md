### **Wiki: What Is DTS?**

DTS stands for Digital Theater Systems and is a series of multichannel audio technologies specializing in digital surround sound formats widely used in film industry, music sharing, and Home Theater. Stephen Spielberg debuted the format in 1993 to improve the sound quality and his Jurassic Park was the first home video release to contain DTS sound.

Actually, playing DTS files on computer is not 100% successful as DTS supports various formats including MKV, AVI, MPEG4, MPEG2, RIFF, CFF, etc that not all media players on computer support. You have to convert MKV DTS to MKV AC3/MP3/MP2/PCM, AVI DTS to AVI MP3 or DTS to WAV/AAC/FLAC/WMA/OGG/M4A etc. that probably be supported by VLC, Windows Media Player, Media Player Classic, MXPlayer, etc. Alternatively, you have to get a DTS decoder like ac3filter to strenghten your DTS player.
