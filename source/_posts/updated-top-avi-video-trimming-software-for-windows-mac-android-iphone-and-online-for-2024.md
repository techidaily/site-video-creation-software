First, [download](https://tools.techidaily.com/wondershare/filmora/download/) Filmora Video Editor by choosing your operating system, as seen in the screenshot below.

![av video cutters](https://images.wondershare.com/filmora/article-images/2022/07/avi-video-cutters-1.jpg)

Run the setup and let it finish without any pause or break.

**Step 2: Import Your Video to Filmora Video Editor**

Importing your AVI video is a very simple process. Just click on the “Film Clip” icon.

![av video cutters](https://images.wondershare.com/filmora/article-images/2022/07/avi-video-cutters-2.jpg)

It will open a new window screen on your computer to select the video from the directory. Find the clip you want to import and cut. Use your mouse to select it and click the “Open” button.

![av video cutters](https://images.wondershare.com/filmora/article-images/2022/07/avi-video-cutters-3.jpg)

The video will be loaded in the “Media” folder of Filmora. The clip's thumbnail should be visible to assure you have done everything correctly.

![av video cutters](https://images.wondershare.com/filmora/article-images/2022/07/avi-video-cutters-4.jpg)

If you can see that, let’s go to the next step.

**Step 3: Drag and Drop Video to Filmora’s Timeline**

Select the video in the media folder by clicking over it once. Now, without leaving the hold of the left button of your mouse, slide the video down to the track in the timeline.

![av video cutters](https://images.wondershare.com/filmora/article-images/2022/07/avi-video-cutters-5.jpg)

After that, a message will pop up, asking about your preference for the project settings. It is recommended to choose the “Match to Media” option unless you’re an experienced video editor who knows how to play with the resolution and frame rates.

![av video cutters](https://images.wondershare.com/filmora/article-images/2022/07/avi-video-cutters-6.jpg)

You will see the video on the timeline with its preview on the “Preview Screen” on the right side of the interface.

![av video cutters](https://images.wondershare.com/filmora/article-images/2022/07/avi-video-cutters-7.jpg)

**Step 4: Cutting Your Video in Filmora**

Here comes the core step you have been waiting for. But before you go any further, you need to know about the “Playhead.”

Playhead is an orange-reddish marker you can find on the timeline.

![av video cutters](https://images.wondershare.com/filmora/article-images/2022/07/avi-video-cutters-8.jpg)

It has an important role in cutting your videos.

So, move the playhead to your desired frame and click on the “scissor” icon to make the “starting” cut.

![av video cutters](https://images.wondershare.com/filmora/article-images/2022/07/avi-video-cutters-9.jpg)

As soon as you do it, you will see that the single clip is now divided into two parts similar to this image.

![av video cutters](https://images.wondershare.com/filmora/article-images/2022/07/avi-video-cutters-10.jpg)

The “Red” marked area in the above screenshot ensures a gap between the clips on the timeline. The “Yellow” arrows confirm two separate clips of the same video.

Place the two clips together as seen in this “Green” area.

![av video cutters](https://images.wondershare.com/filmora/article-images/2022/07/avi-video-cutters-11.jpg)

And place the playhead anywhere on the clip. And click on the “scissor” icon once again to make the “ending” cut (second cut).

![av video cutters](https://images.wondershare.com/filmora/article-images/2022/07/avi-video-cutters-12.jpg)

![av video cutters](https://images.wondershare.com/filmora/article-images/2022/07/avi-video-cutters-13.jpg)

If done correctly, there should be three clips now of the same video, as you can observe in this screenshot.

![av video cutters](https://images.wondershare.com/filmora/article-images/2022/07/avi-video-cutters-14.jpg)

Again, the “Red” area in the above photo indicates the gap, and the “Yellow” area ensures a third segment of the video.

**_Note_**_: The gaps you can see in the divided clips are made intentionally for understanding. Practically, Filmora doesn’t move the clip or make gaps in between after you have made the cuts._

Keep in mind that there are three clips on the timeline. Now, if you want to remove the second clip from the video, you need to select that portion first by clicking on it.

![av video cutters](https://images.wondershare.com/filmora/article-images/2022/07/avi-video-cutters-15.jpg)

Then, right-click on the mouse and choose “Cut” from the menu.

![av video cutters](https://images.wondershare.com/filmora/article-images/2022/07/avi-video-cutters-16.jpg)

Within a semi-second, the selected portion will be removed from the timeline. And you will be able to see the remaining parts of the video. Now, pull the second clip using your mouse and place it at the end of the first clip without leaving a gap in between.

Then, click the “Play” button under the preview screen to see the results.

![av video cutters](https://images.wondershare.com/filmora/article-images/2022/07/avi-video-cutters-17.jpg)

![av video cutters](https://images.wondershare.com/filmora/article-images/2022/07/avi-video-cutters-18.jpg)

You can see in the above two screenshots that there’s a jump between the scenes due to cuts, confirming that video has been cut significantly.

**Step 5: Trimming Your Video in Filmora**

Remember that cutting and trimming in Filmora are two different things. Trimming allows you to remove a particular video part from visibility without deleting the portion.

So feel free to skip this step if you’re happy learning the cutting technique. But if you’re interested in trimming, here’s how you do it.

Take your mouse cursor at the beginning or end of the clip you want to trim. Keep holding the clip’s corner and slide the mouse back or front to trim the part

![av video cutters](https://images.wondershare.com/filmora/article-images/2022/07/avi-video-cutters-19.jpg)

**_Note:_** _Since the trim tool doesn’t delete the video, the final project based on trimming will be of a larger size. Therefore, it is advised to cut videos rather than trimming for fast rendering, better results, and small video size._

**Step 6: Save Project and Export Your Cut/Trimmed AVI Video**

Choose “Save Project” from the “File” menu.

![av video cutters](https://images.wondershare.com/filmora/article-images/2022/07/avi-video-cutters-20.jpg)

Select the directory to save the project, rename the new video, and click the “Save” button.

![av video cutters](https://images.wondershare.com/filmora/article-images/2022/07/avi-video-cutters-21.jpg)

Click on the “Export” button to save the video in AVI or any other video format of your choice on your computer.

![av video cutters](https://images.wondershare.com/filmora/article-images/2022/07/avi-video-cutters-22.jpg)

## Part 2: Top 3 Free AVI Video Cutter on Windows

As a Windows user, finding an excellent video cutter is relatively easy. However, not all software permits importing AVI videos. In the same way, some video trimmers come at a price. So if you really don’t want to pay and enjoy cutting your AVI files, try using these three video cutting tools.

### Microsoft Photos (Windows 10)

![av video cutters](https://images.wondershare.com/filmora/article-images/2022/07/avi-video-cutters-23.jpg)

[Microsoft Photos](https://apps.microsoft.com/store/detail/microsoft-photos/9WZDNCRFJBH4?hl=en-pk&gl=PK) or Photo App is a free photo viewer and editor with your Windows 10\. It offers incredible photo editing and enhancement along with different tools for organizing and editing videos in a very friendly way. Likewise, you can create drawings over the videos and add 3D effects and background music to your clips.

You can also trim AVI videos with Microsoft Photos quickly. All you need to do is open your clip with the Photo App, choose the “Trim” option, select a portion of the video you want to trim, and go ahead.

That’s it!

**Features**

* Quick video trimming
* Cool text effects
* 3D library and effects
* It has a clear interface
* You can find and tag people’s faces
* The program has 15+ filters for editing
* Motion tracking option for drawing on videos
* Allows you to view and organize your files easily

**Pros**

### Handbrake

![av video cutters](https://images.wondershare.com/filmora/article-images/2022/07/avi-video-cutters-24.jpg)

[Handbrake](https://handbrake.fr/downloads.php) is best-known for its video transcoding traits. Unlike typical video editors, this open-source tool includes limited options to rip Blu-rays and DVDs. Moreover, you can mix the 5.1 soundtracks and convert them to stereo to make the audio compatible with your TV speakers.

But the exciting thing about Handbrake is that you can use this software on your macOS 10.13 or later versions to cut AVI videos for free. However, it’s a bit technical process, as there’s no timeline to help you trim or make cuts on the clips directly with the help of your mouse.

You are required to mention a time range (seconds, minutes, or hours) to keep a specific part of the video while the software removes the non-ranged parts of the clip. For instance, you have a video of 10 seconds. You start the range from 5 seconds and end it at 10 seconds. So, the first four seconds of the video will be cut from the entire clip.

**Features**

* Video cutting, cropping, and resizing
* Low-quality and old video restoration
* Video conversion from any format to MKV or MP4

**Pros**

* Handbrake is free
* You can convert batch videos with ease
* It supports MAC, Windows, and Linux OS
* Allows you to import video files in all major formats
* The software comes with various video conversion presets

**Cons**

* Handbrake is not a user-friendly tool
* The video file output is limited to two formats (MKV and MP4) only

Another fascinating fact about this software is that it allows you to cut videos in three simple steps without losing the quality. So right after installing the program, you simply need to import your file, choose the start and end time, and click the “Cut” button to remove the part of the video.

**Features**

* Fast video and audio cutting

* It supports most audio and video formats

![av video cutters](https://images.wondershare.com/filmora/article-images/2022/07/avi-video-cutters-1.jpg)

Run the setup and let it finish without any pause or break.

**Step 2: Import Your Video to Filmora Video Editor**

Importing your AVI video is a very simple process. Just click on the “Film Clip” icon.

![av video cutters](https://images.wondershare.com/filmora/article-images/2022/07/avi-video-cutters-2.jpg)

It will open a new window screen on your computer to select the video from the directory. Find the clip you want to import and cut. Use your mouse to select it and click the “Open” button.

![av video cutters](https://images.wondershare.com/filmora/article-images/2022/07/avi-video-cutters-3.jpg)

The video will be loaded in the “Media” folder of Filmora. The clip's thumbnail should be visible to assure you have done everything correctly.

![av video cutters](https://images.wondershare.com/filmora/article-images/2022/07/avi-video-cutters-4.jpg)

If you can see that, let’s go to the next step.

**Step 3: Drag and Drop Video to Filmora’s Timeline**

Select the video in the media folder by clicking over it once. Now, without leaving the hold of the left button of your mouse, slide the video down to the track in the timeline.

![av video cutters](https://images.wondershare.com/filmora/article-images/2022/07/avi-video-cutters-5.jpg)

After that, a message will pop up, asking about your preference for the project settings. It is recommended to choose the “Match to Media” option unless you’re an experienced video editor who knows how to play with the resolution and frame rates.

![av video cutters](https://images.wondershare.com/filmora/article-images/2022/07/avi-video-cutters-6.jpg)

You will see the video on the timeline with its preview on the “Preview Screen” on the right side of the interface.

![av video cutters](https://images.wondershare.com/filmora/article-images/2022/07/avi-video-cutters-7.jpg)

**Step 4: Cutting Your Video in Filmora**

Here comes the core step you have been waiting for. But before you go any further, you need to know about the “Playhead.”

Playhead is an orange-reddish marker you can find on the timeline.

![av video cutters](https://images.wondershare.com/filmora/article-images/2022/07/avi-video-cutters-8.jpg)

It has an important role in cutting your videos.

So, move the playhead to your desired frame and click on the “scissor” icon to make the “starting” cut.

![av video cutters](https://images.wondershare.com/filmora/article-images/2022/07/avi-video-cutters-9.jpg)

As soon as you do it, you will see that the single clip is now divided into two parts similar to this image.

![av video cutters](https://images.wondershare.com/filmora/article-images/2022/07/avi-video-cutters-10.jpg)

The “Red” marked area in the above screenshot ensures a gap between the clips on the timeline. The “Yellow” arrows confirm two separate clips of the same video.

Place the two clips together as seen in this “Green” area.

![av video cutters](https://images.wondershare.com/filmora/article-images/2022/07/avi-video-cutters-11.jpg)

And place the playhead anywhere on the clip. And click on the “scissor” icon once again to make the “ending” cut (second cut).

![av video cutters](https://images.wondershare.com/filmora/article-images/2022/07/avi-video-cutters-12.jpg)

![av video cutters](https://images.wondershare.com/filmora/article-images/2022/07/avi-video-cutters-13.jpg)

If done correctly, there should be three clips now of the same video, as you can observe in this screenshot.

![av video cutters](https://images.wondershare.com/filmora/article-images/2022/07/avi-video-cutters-14.jpg)

Again, the “Red” area in the above photo indicates the gap, and the “Yellow” area ensures a third segment of the video.

**_Note_**_: The gaps you can see in the divided clips are made intentionally for understanding. Practically, Filmora doesn’t move the clip or make gaps in between after you have made the cuts._

Keep in mind that there are three clips on the timeline. Now, if you want to remove the second clip from the video, you need to select that portion first by clicking on it.

![av video cutters](https://images.wondershare.com/filmora/article-images/2022/07/avi-video-cutters-15.jpg)

Then, right-click on the mouse and choose “Cut” from the menu.

![av video cutters](https://images.wondershare.com/filmora/article-images/2022/07/avi-video-cutters-16.jpg)

Within a semi-second, the selected portion will be removed from the timeline. And you will be able to see the remaining parts of the video. Now, pull the second clip using your mouse and place it at the end of the first clip without leaving a gap in between.

Then, click the “Play” button under the preview screen to see the results.

![av video cutters](https://images.wondershare.com/filmora/article-images/2022/07/avi-video-cutters-17.jpg)

![av video cutters](https://images.wondershare.com/filmora/article-images/2022/07/avi-video-cutters-18.jpg)

You can see in the above two screenshots that there’s a jump between the scenes due to cuts, confirming that video has been cut significantly.

**Step 5: Trimming Your Video in Filmora**

Remember that cutting and trimming in Filmora are two different things. Trimming allows you to remove a particular video part from visibility without deleting the portion.

So feel free to skip this step if you’re happy learning the cutting technique. But if you’re interested in trimming, here’s how you do it.

Take your mouse cursor at the beginning or end of the clip you want to trim. Keep holding the clip’s corner and slide the mouse back or front to trim the part

![av video cutters](https://images.wondershare.com/filmora/article-images/2022/07/avi-video-cutters-19.jpg)

**_Note:_** _Since the trim tool doesn’t delete the video, the final project based on trimming will be of a larger size. Therefore, it is advised to cut videos rather than trimming for fast rendering, better results, and small video size._

**Step 6: Save Project and Export Your Cut/Trimmed AVI Video**

Choose “Save Project” from the “File” menu.

![av video cutters](https://images.wondershare.com/filmora/article-images/2022/07/avi-video-cutters-20.jpg)

Select the directory to save the project, rename the new video, and click the “Save” button.

![av video cutters](https://images.wondershare.com/filmora/article-images/2022/07/avi-video-cutters-21.jpg)

Click on the “Export” button to save the video in AVI or any other video format of your choice on your computer.

## Part 2: Top 3 Free AVI Video Cutter on Windows

As a Windows user, finding an excellent video cutter is relatively easy. However, not all software permits importing AVI videos. In the same way, some video trimmers come at a price. So if you really don’t want to pay and enjoy cutting your AVI files, try using these three video cutting tools.

### Microsoft Photos (Windows 10)

![av video cutters](https://images.wondershare.com/filmora/article-images/2022/07/avi-video-cutters-23.jpg)

[Microsoft Photos](https://apps.microsoft.com/store/detail/microsoft-photos/9WZDNCRFJBH4?hl=en-pk&gl=PK) or Photo App is a free photo viewer and editor with your Windows 10\. It offers incredible photo editing and enhancement along with different tools for organizing and editing videos in a very friendly way. Likewise, you can create drawings over the videos and add 3D effects and background music to your clips.

You can also trim AVI videos with Microsoft Photos quickly. All you need to do is open your clip with the Photo App, choose the “Trim” option, select a portion of the video you want to trim, and go ahead.

That’s it!

**Features**

* Quick video trimming
* Cool text effects
* 3D library and effects
* It has a clear interface

![av video cutters](https://images.wondershare.com/filmora/article-images/2022/07/avi-video-cutters-24.jpg)

Moreover, you can mix the 5.1 soundtracks and convert them to stereo to make the audio compatible with your TV speakers.

But the exciting thing about Handbrake is that you can use this software on your macOS 10.13 or later versions to cut AVI videos for free. However, it’s a bit technical process, as there’s no timeline to help you trim or make cuts on the clips directly with the help of your mouse.

You are required to mention a time range (seconds, minutes, or hours) to keep a specific part of the video while the software removes the non-ranged parts of the clip. For instance, you have a video of 10 seconds. You start the range from 5 seconds and end it at 10 seconds. So, the first four seconds of the video will be cut from the entire clip.

**Features**

* Video cutting, cropping, and resizing
* Low-quality and old video restoration
* Video conversion from any format to MKV or MP4

**Pros**

* Handbrake is free
* You can convert batch videos with ease
* It supports MAC, Windows, and Linux OS
* Allows you to import video files in all major formats
* The software comes with various video conversion presets

**Features**

* Fast video and audio cutting

In fact, Filmora is equipped with many jaw-dropping features, including preset templates, auto beat sync, split-screen, speed ramping, motion tracking, keyframing, creative transitions, titles, filters, and much more. And the best part is, you can learn and understand Filmora in no time. That’s why the program is loved and supported by all types of users.

So does Filmora helps cut and trim AVI videos? Yes! It does if you follow these steps correctly.

**Step 1: Download Filmora Video Editor**

First, [download](https://tools.techidaily.com/wondershare/filmora/download/) Filmora Video Editor by choosing your operating system, as seen in the screenshot below.

![av video cutters](https://images.wondershare.com/filmora/article-images/2022/07/avi-video-cutters-1.jpg)

Run the setup and let it finish without any pause or break.

**Step 2: Import Your Video to Filmora Video Editor**

Importing your AVI video is a very simple process. Just click on the “Film Clip” icon.

![av video cutters](https://images.wondershare.com/filmora/article-images/2022/07/avi-video-cutters-2.jpg)

It will open a new window screen on your computer to select the video from the directory. Find the clip you want to import and cut. Use your mouse to select it and click the “Open” button.

![av video cutters](https://images.wondershare.com/filmora/article-images/2022/07/avi-video-cutters-3.jpg)

The video will be loaded in the “Media” folder of Filmora. The clip's thumbnail should be visible to assure you have done everything correctly.

![av video cutters](https://images.wondershare.com/filmora/article-images/2022/07/avi-video-cutters-4.jpg)

If you can see that, let’s go to the next step.

**Step 3: Drag and Drop Video to Filmora’s Timeline**

Select the video in the media folder by clicking over it once. Now, without leaving the hold of the left button of your mouse, slide the video down to the track in the timeline.

![av video cutters](https://images.wondershare.com/filmora/article-images/2022/07/avi-video-cutters-5.jpg)

After that, a message will pop up, asking about your preference for the project settings. It is recommended to choose the “Match to Media” option unless you’re an experienced video editor who knows how to play with the resolution and frame rates.

![av video cutters](https://images.wondershare.com/filmora/article-images/2022/07/avi-video-cutters-6.jpg)

You will see the video on the timeline with its preview on the “Preview Screen” on the right side of the interface.

![av video cutters](https://images.wondershare.com/filmora/article-images/2022/07/avi-video-cutters-7.jpg)

**Step 4: Cutting Your Video in Filmora**

Here comes the core step you have been waiting for. But before you go any further, you need to know about the “Playhead.”

Playhead is an orange-reddish marker you can find on the timeline.

![av video cutters](https://images.wondershare.com/filmora/article-images/2022/07/avi-video-cutters-8.jpg)

It has an important role in cutting your videos.

So, move the playhead to your desired frame and click on the “scissor” icon to make the “starting” cut.

![av video cutters](https://images.wondershare.com/filmora/article-images/2022/07/avi-video-cutters-9.jpg)

As soon as you do it, you will see that the single clip is now divided into two parts similar to this image.

![av video cutters](https://images.wondershare.com/filmora/article-images/2022/07/avi-video-cutters-10.jpg)

The “Red” marked area in the above screenshot ensures a gap between the clips on the timeline. The “Yellow” arrows confirm two separate clips of the same video.

Place the two clips together as seen in this “Green” area.

![av video cutters](https://images.wondershare.com/filmora/article-images/2022/07/avi-video-cutters-11.jpg)

And place the playhead anywhere on the clip. And click on the “scissor” icon once again to make the “ending” cut (second cut).

![av video cutters](https://images.wondershare.com/filmora/article-images/2022/07/avi-video-cutters-12.jpg)

![av video cutters](https://images.wondershare.com/filmora/article-images/2022/07/avi-video-cutters-13.jpg)

If done correctly, there should be three clips now of the same video, as you can observe in this screenshot.

![av video cutters](https://images.wondershare.com/filmora/article-images/2022/07/avi-video-cutters-14.jpg)

Again, the “Red” area in the above photo indicates the gap, and the “Yellow” area ensures a third segment of the video.

**_Note_**_: The gaps you can see in the divided clips are made intentionally for understanding. Practically, Filmora doesn’t move the clip or make gaps in between after you have made the cuts._

Keep in mind that there are three clips on the timeline. Now, if you want to remove the second clip from the video, you need to select that portion first by clicking on it.

![av video cutters](https://images.wondershare.com/filmora/article-images/2022/07/avi-video-cutters-15.jpg)

Then, right-click on the mouse and choose “Cut” from the menu.

![av video cutters](https://images.wondershare.com/filmora/article-images/2022/07/avi-video-cutters-16.jpg)

Within a semi-second, the selected portion will be removed from the timeline. And you will be able to see the remaining parts of the video. Now, pull the second clip using your mouse and place it at the end of the first clip without leaving a gap in between.

Then, click the “Play” button under the preview screen to see the results.

![av video cutters](https://images.wondershare.com/filmora/article-images/2022/07/avi-video-cutters-17.jpg)

![av video cutters](https://images.wondershare.com/filmora/article-images/2022/07/avi-video-cutters-18.jpg)

You can see in the above two screenshots that there’s a jump between the scenes due to cuts, confirming that video has been cut significantly.

**Step 5: Trimming Your Video in Filmora**

Remember that cutting and trimming in Filmora are two different things. Trimming allows you to remove a particular video part from visibility without deleting the portion.

So feel free to skip this step if you’re happy learning the cutting technique. But if you’re interested in trimming, here’s how you do it.

Take your mouse cursor at the beginning or end of the clip you want to trim. Keep holding the clip’s corner and slide the mouse back or front to trim the part

![av video cutters](https://images.wondershare.com/filmora/article-images/2022/07/avi-video-cutters-19.jpg)

**_Note:_** _Since the trim tool doesn’t delete the video, the final project based on trimming will be of a larger size. Therefore, it is advised to cut videos rather than trimming for fast rendering, better results, and small video size._

**Step 6: Save Project and Export Your Cut/Trimmed AVI Video**

Choose “Save Project” from the “File” menu.

![av video cutters](https://images.wondershare.com/filmora/article-images/2022/07/avi-video-cutters-20.jpg)

Select the directory to save the project, rename the new video, and click the “Save” button.

![av video cutters](https://images.wondershare.com/filmora/article-images/2022/07/avi-video-cutters-21.jpg)

Click on the “Export” button to save the video in AVI or any other video format of your choice on your computer.

## Part 2: Top 3 Free AVI Video Cutter on Windows

As a Windows user, finding an excellent video cutter is relatively easy. However, not all software permits importing AVI videos. In the same way, some video trimmers come at a price. So if you really don’t want to pay and enjoy cutting your AVI files, try using these three video cutting tools.

### Microsoft Photos (Windows 10)

![av video cutters](https://images.wondershare.com/filmora/article-images/2022/07/avi-video-cutters-23.jpg)

[Microsoft Photos](https://apps.microsoft.com/store/detail/microsoft-photos/9WZDNCRFJBH4?hl=en-pk&gl=PK) or Photo App is a free photo viewer and editor with your Windows 10\. It offers incredible photo editing and enhancement along with different tools for organizing and editing videos in a very friendly way. Likewise, you can create drawings over the videos and add 3D effects and background music to your clips.

You can also trim AVI videos with Microsoft Photos quickly. All you need to do is open your clip with the Photo App, choose the “Trim” option, select a portion of the video you want to trim, and go ahead.

That’s it!

**Features**

* Quick video trimming
* Cool text effects
* 3D library and effects
* It has a clear interface
* You can find and tag people’s faces
* The program has 15+ filters for editing
* Motion tracking option for drawing on videos
* Allows you to view and organize your files easily

![av video cutters](https://images.wondershare.com/filmora/article-images/2022/07/avi-video-cutters-24.jpg)

Moreover, you can mix the 5.1 soundtracks and convert them to stereo to make the audio compatible with your TV speakers.

But the exciting thing about Handbrake is that you can use this software on your macOS 10.13 or later versions to cut AVI videos for free. However, it’s a bit technical process, as there’s no timeline to help you trim or make cuts on the clips directly with the help of your mouse.

You are required to mention a time range (seconds, minutes, or hours) to keep a specific part of the video while the software removes the non-ranged parts of the clip. For instance, you have a video of 10 seconds. You start the range from 5 seconds and end it at 10 seconds. So, the first four seconds of the video will be cut from the entire clip.

**Features**

* Video cutting, cropping, and resizing
* Low-quality and old video restoration
* Video conversion from any format to MKV or MP4

**Pros**

* Handbrake is free
* You can convert batch videos with ease
* It supports MAC, Windows, and Linux OS
* Allows you to import video files in all major formats
* The software comes with various video conversion presets

**Cons**

* Handbrake is not a user-friendly tool
* The video file output is limited to two formats (MKV and MP4) only

**Features**

* Fast video and audio cutting

* It supports most audio and video formats

![av video cutters](https://images.wondershare.com/filmora/article-images/2022/07/avi-video-cutters-3.jpg)

The video will be loaded in the “Media” folder of Filmora. The clip's thumbnail should be visible to assure you have done everything correctly.

![av video cutters](https://images.wondershare.com/filmora/article-images/2022/07/avi-video-cutters-4.jpg)

If you can see that, let’s go to the next step.

**Step 3: Drag and Drop Video to Filmora’s Timeline**

Select the video in the media folder by clicking over it once. Now, without leaving the hold of the left button of your mouse, slide the video down to the track in the timeline.

![av video cutters](https://images.wondershare.com/filmora/article-images/2022/07/avi-video-cutters-5.jpg)

After that, a message will pop up, asking about your preference for the project settings. It is recommended to choose the “Match to Media” option unless you’re an experienced video editor who knows how to play with the resolution and frame rates.

![av video cutters](https://images.wondershare.com/filmora/article-images/2022/07/avi-video-cutters-6.jpg)

You will see the video on the timeline with its preview on the “Preview Screen” on the right side of the interface.

![av video cutters](https://images.wondershare.com/filmora/article-images/2022/07/avi-video-cutters-7.jpg)

**Step 4: Cutting Your Video in Filmora**

Here comes the core step you have been waiting for. But before you go any further, you need to know about the “Playhead.”

Playhead is an orange-reddish marker you can find on the timeline.

![av video cutters](https://images.wondershare.com/filmora/article-images/2022/07/avi-video-cutters-8.jpg)

It has an important role in cutting your videos.

So, move the playhead to your desired frame and click on the “scissor” icon to make the “starting” cut.

![av video cutters](https://images.wondershare.com/filmora/article-images/2022/07/avi-video-cutters-9.jpg)

As soon as you do it, you will see that the single clip is now divided into two parts similar to this image.

![av video cutters](https://images.wondershare.com/filmora/article-images/2022/07/avi-video-cutters-10.jpg)

The “Red” marked area in the above screenshot ensures a gap between the clips on the timeline. The “Yellow” arrows confirm two separate clips of the same video.

Place the two clips together as seen in this “Green” area.

![av video cutters](https://images.wondershare.com/filmora/article-images/2022/07/avi-video-cutters-11.jpg)

And place the playhead anywhere on the clip. And click on the “scissor” icon once again to make the “ending” cut (second cut).

![av video cutters](https://images.wondershare.com/filmora/article-images/2022/07/avi-video-cutters-12.jpg)

![av video cutters](https://images.wondershare.com/filmora/article-images/2022/07/avi-video-cutters-13.jpg)

If done correctly, there should be three clips now of the same video, as you can observe in this screenshot.

![av video cutters](https://images.wondershare.com/filmora/article-images/2022/07/avi-video-cutters-14.jpg)

Again, the “Red” area in the above photo indicates the gap, and the “Yellow” area ensures a third segment of the video.

**_Note_**_: The gaps you can see in the divided clips are made intentionally for understanding. Practically, Filmora doesn’t move the clip or make gaps in between after you have made the cuts._

Keep in mind that there are three clips on the timeline. Now, if you want to remove the second clip from the video, you need to select that portion first by clicking on it.

![av video cutters](https://images.wondershare.com/filmora/article-images/2022/07/avi-video-cutters-15.jpg)

Then, right-click on the mouse and choose “Cut” from the menu.

![av video cutters](https://images.wondershare.com/filmora/article-images/2022/07/avi-video-cutters-16.jpg)

Within a semi-second, the selected portion will be removed from the timeline. And you will be able to see the remaining parts of the video. Now, pull the second clip using your mouse and place it at the end of the first clip without leaving a gap in between.

Then, click the “Play” button under the preview screen to see the results.

![av video cutters](https://images.wondershare.com/filmora/article-images/2022/07/avi-video-cutters-17.jpg)

![av video cutters](https://images.wondershare.com/filmora/article-images/2022/07/avi-video-cutters-18.jpg)

You can see in the above two screenshots that there’s a jump between the scenes due to cuts, confirming that video has been cut significantly.

**Step 5: Trimming Your Video in Filmora**

Remember that cutting and trimming in Filmora are two different things. Trimming allows you to remove a particular video part from visibility without deleting the portion.

So feel free to skip this step if you’re happy learning the cutting technique. But if you’re interested in trimming, here’s how you do it.

Take your mouse cursor at the beginning or end of the clip you want to trim. Keep holding the clip’s corner and slide the mouse back or front to trim the part

![av video cutters](https://images.wondershare.com/filmora/article-images/2022/07/avi-video-cutters-19.jpg)

**_Note:_** _Since the trim tool doesn’t delete the video, the final project based on trimming will be of a larger size. Therefore, it is advised to cut videos rather than trimming for fast rendering, better results, and small video size._

**Step 6: Save Project and Export Your Cut/Trimmed AVI Video**

Choose “Save Project” from the “File” menu.

![av video cutters](https://images.wondershare.com/filmora/article-images/2022/07/avi-video-cutters-20.jpg)

Select the directory to save the project, rename the new video, and click the “Save” button.

![av video cutters](https://images.wondershare.com/filmora/article-images/2022/07/avi-video-cutters-21.jpg)

Click on the “Export” button to save the video in AVI or any other video format of your choice on your computer.

## Part 2: Top 3 Free AVI Video Cutter on Windows

As a Windows user, finding an excellent video cutter is relatively easy. However, not all software permits importing AVI videos. In the same way, some video trimmers come at a price. So if you really don’t want to pay and enjoy cutting your AVI files, try using these three video cutting tools.

### Microsoft Photos (Windows 10)

![av video cutters](https://images.wondershare.com/filmora/article-images/2022/07/avi-video-cutters-23.jpg)

[Microsoft Photos](https://apps.microsoft.com/store/detail/microsoft-photos/9WZDNCRFJBH4?hl=en-pk&gl=PK) or Photo App is a free photo viewer and editor with your Windows 10\. It offers incredible photo editing and enhancement along with different tools for organizing and editing videos in a very friendly way. Likewise, you can create drawings over the videos and add 3D effects and background music to your clips.

You can also trim AVI videos with Microsoft Photos quickly. All you need to do is open your clip with the Photo App, choose the “Trim” option, select a portion of the video you want to trim, and go ahead.

That’s it!

**Features**

* Quick video trimming
* Cool text effects
* 3D library and effects
* It has a clear interface
* You can find and tag people’s faces
* The program has 15+ filters for editing
* Motion tracking option for drawing on videos
* Allows you to view and organize your files easily

### Handbrake

![av video cutters](https://images.wondershare.com/filmora/article-images/2022/07/avi-video-cutters-24.jpg)

Moreover, you can mix the 5.1 soundtracks and convert them to stereo to make the audio compatible with your TV speakers.

But the exciting thing about Handbrake is that you can use this software on your macOS 10.13 or later versions to cut AVI videos for free. However, it’s a bit technical process, as there’s no timeline to help you trim or make cuts on the clips directly with the help of your mouse.

You are required to mention a time range (seconds, minutes, or hours) to keep a specific part of the video while the software removes the non-ranged parts of the clip. For instance, you have a video of 10 seconds. You start the range from 5 seconds and end it at 10 seconds. So, the first four seconds of the video will be cut from the entire clip.

**Features**

* Video cutting, cropping, and resizing
* Low-quality and old video restoration
* Video conversion from any format to MKV or MP4

**Pros**

* Handbrake is free
* You can convert batch videos with ease
* It supports MAC, Windows, and Linux OS
* Allows you to import video files in all major formats
* The software comes with various video conversion presets

**Cons**

* Handbrake is not a user-friendly tool
* The video file output is limited to two formats (MKV and MP4) only

**Features**

## Part 2: How to Add 3D Effects to Video with Filmora

Although Photos is a free app in Windows 11, it has certain limitations. This is where [Filmora video editor](https://tools.techidaily.com/wondershare/filmora/download/), a product by Wondershare, comes into play.

While the Photos app can add 3D effects to the videos quickly, Filmora gives more control by offering a plethora of editing tools, options, and presets. In addition, Filmora is a timeline-oriented tool that allows you to add effects, filters, and/or elements in their corresponding layers without making any changes to the original footage.

Next, hover the mouse over the thumbnail of the video, click the **+** icon from the bottom-right corner.

When the confirmation box appears, either click **Match to Media** or **Keep Project Settings** to adjust the project settings according to the media clip or modify the media clip according to the project preferences while adding the footage to the Timeline respectively.

**Step 2: Add 3D Titles and Transitions**

Click **Titles** from the toolbox at the top, type **3D Titles** in the **Search titles** field present at the upper section of the upper-left box, and click **3D titles** from the suggestions list.

![add 3d title effects to video filmora](https://images.wondershare.com/filmora/article-images/add-3d-title-effects-to-video-filmora.jpg)

After this, double-click the placeholder text in the **Preview** window, and replace it with your caption. You can customize the font, color, and alignment of the text from the options that appear on left. Click **OK** from the lower-left area of the left pane to exit the editing mode.

**Step 3: Add Elements and Effects**

Go to **Elements** from the toolbox, drag your preferred element from the upper-left box to the Timeline, and place it on a new track. You can drag the sides of the element in the Timeline to increase or decrease its visibility during video playback.

To add effects, go to **Effects** from the toolbox, drag your preferred effect from the upper-left box, and place it on a new layer in the Timeline. As it is with other entities, you can drag the sides of the effect to increase or decrease the duration of its impact on the video. Next, double-click the **Effects** layer in the Timeline, and use the available options in the box to make further adjustments.

**Note:** The options that you get by double-clicking the effect in the Timeline may vary according to the adjustments it allows you to make.

You can customize the font, color, and alignment of the text from the options that appear on left. Click **OK** from the lower-left area of the left pane to exit the editing mode. Repeat the process for all the texts that the preset has. Optionally, drag the sides of the 3D title in the Timeline to specify its duration of visibility on the screen.

![edit 3d title effects in video filmora](https://images.wondershare.com/filmora/article-images/edit-3d-title-effects-in-video-filmora.jpg)

To add the transitions, click **Media** from the toolbox at the top, click **Import Media** from the **Media** box, and repeat the process explained earlier to add a new video clip to the Timeline. Make sure that both the clips are on the same track, and are placed next to each other. Now, go to **Transitions** from the toolbox, and drag and place your preferred transition effect between the two media clips in the Timeline. Optionally you can drag the sides of the transition inwards or outwards to increase or decrease the speed of the effect respectively.

![add 3d transition effects to video filmora](https://images.wondershare.com/filmora/article-images/add-3d-transition-effects-to-video-filmora.jpg)

After this, move the **Playhead** (**Skimmer**) to the beginning of the Timeline, and press the **Spacebar** on your keyboard to preview the video.

**Note:** It is a good practice to preview your video several times during the entire editing process. This will help you identify the error sooner, and you will be able to address the issue with fewer hassles.

**Step 3: Add Elements and Effects**

Go to **Elements** from the toolbox, drag your preferred element from the upper-left box to the Timeline, and place it on a new track. You can drag the sides of the element in the Timeline to increase or decrease its visibility during video playback.

![add 3d elements to video filmora](https://images.wondershare.com/filmora/article-images/add-3d-elements-to-video-filmora.jpg)

To add effects, go to **Effects** from the toolbox, drag your preferred effect from the upper-left box, and place it on a new layer in the Timeline. As it is with other entities, you can drag the sides of the effect to increase or decrease the duration of its impact on the video. Next, double-click the **Effects** layer in the Timeline, and use the available options in the box to make further adjustments.

**Note:** The options that you get by double-clicking the effect in the Timeline may vary according to the adjustments it allows you to make.

![add 3d effects to video filmora](https://images.wondershare.com/filmora/article-images/add-3d-effects-to-video-filmora.jpg)

Once this is done, preview the video, click **Export** from the top-center, and use the tabs and options on the **Export** box to export the modified video in your preferred format.

**Conclusion**

If you are new to the VFX and video editing industry, trying hands with the Photos app would give you a fair idea about how things work. Once you are well-versed or if you are already a post-production professional, you can and you must go for a dedicated program like Wondershare Filmora that not only has an intuitive interface, it is also equipped with a plethora of presets to add 3D titles, elements, transitions, and effects to the videos without much hassle.

Freemake video Cutter does exactly what its name suggests, and that is cut video. As well as MP4 it can deal with several other video formats, it uses a nice easy to follow interface and is a nice compact package that does the job well.

![Free Video Cutter](https://images.wondershare.com/multimedia/free-video-cutter.jpg)

One of the easiest to use, a simple interface and good performance.

#### 7\. [Freemake Video Converter](http://www.freemake.com/free%5Fvideo%5Fconverter/)

Whilst, as the name suggests, this package was designed for format conversion, it includes a wealth of other abilities, one of which is video cutting, it can also rejoin and merge clips too. As a video converter, it has the largest range of format compatibility in the list and can even burn your finished videos to DVD or Blu-ray for you. The cutting feature is nicely implemented into a clear interface and should be straightforward for anyone to use.

![Freemake Video Converter](https://images.wondershare.com/multimedia/freemake-video-converter.png)

An easy to use interface and a comprehensive feature set far beyond just cutting make this a great general video utility package.

#### 8\. [Movica](https://sourceforge.net/projects/movica/)

This package uses other open source scripting files as the mechanics of doing its job, and is in essence a user interface for those systems. That takes nothing away from it though, the tools it uses are very effective, but in their native form not something most people could take advantage of. In addition to MP4 there are several other video formats available as well as both .wma and .mp3 audio files.

![Movica](https://images.wondershare.com/multimedia/movica1.jpg)

A simple interface and a more technical outlook than many, but it works well.

A fairly comprehensive editing package, VirtualDub has a nice selection of cutting tools enabling accurate cuts and edits with ease, covering the MP4 format as well as several others, it is a useful tool for those looking for additional features beyond just cutting. Due to the lengthy feature set the interface is a little cluttered and for those that want nothing but a cutter, is perhaps overkill, however, it does the job very well and for many presents a useful selection of video tools.

![Virtualdub](https://images.wondershare.com/multimedia/virtualdub1.png)

With plenty of video tools in addition to cutting, VirtualDub presents an attractive, video toolbox for the enthusiast.

#### 10\. [Online Video Cutter](https://online-video-cutter.com/)

Our final offering is a slightly different take on the video cutter. This is an online offering that requires no downloads or installation, you simply go to the website, upload your video or select a video on the web, cut the video and save the output. It is very simple, although there is the obvious issue with larger files of upload and download time, but for many applications is perhaps the ideal solution.
