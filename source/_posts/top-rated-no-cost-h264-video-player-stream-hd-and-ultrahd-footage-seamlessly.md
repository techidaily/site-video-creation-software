"It is strange that I'm able to play H.264 via RMTP, but I can't open the local H.264 encoded file with a standard media player, and even if I played the file successfully, there is only images, no audio!" A user posted this concern on "9ria" forum and hopes to get a solution. To open an H.264 encoded MP4 video, or MKV video, obviously needs a powerful **H.264 player** with H.264 codec built in. Read on to get the idea of H.264 player free download and how to play HD H.264 files. 

H.264, AKA AVC, as its name implies, is Advanced Video Coding which widely used for high definition digital video. A codec based on the H.264 standard compresses a digital video files so that it only uses half the space of MPEG-2\. But to play H.264 file smoothly not only require a higher CPU usage to enable the video acceleration but also need a professional H.264 player to play back the specific H.264 file. 

Of course, you can find and download plenty of H.264 players for free online, but to find the most suitable H.264 player, are you seriously trying to download every video player for H.264 to open your certain H.264 files? In order to nail down your options, I recommend you to download **[hardware accelerated video player](https://tools.techidaily.com/5kplayer/video-music-player/)** 5KPlayer, the best free H.264 video player which plays H.264/H.265 4k with no hassle, just simply load the file and start to play!

**Further Reading:** 

H.264 has obvious advantage when [comparing H.264 to MPEG4](https://tools.techidaily.com/macxdvd/products/), it has higher compressing rate which means it can store more data than MPEG4 on the same hard disk. And as a successor to H.264/AVC, H.265 is said to have two times the data compression ratio compared to H.264 at the same level of video quality. So speaking of [H.265 vs. H.264](https://tools.techidaily.com/winxdvd/products/), H.265 simply surpasses H.264 in general. But the good thing is that as an H.264 player freeware, 5KPlayer can easily play H.265, MPEG4 as well.
