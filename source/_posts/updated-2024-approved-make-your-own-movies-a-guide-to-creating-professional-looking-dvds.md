**Price:**  Free

![MP4 to MP3 Converter app for Android ](https://images.wondershare.com/filmora/article-images/video-to-mp3-converter.jpg)

Extracting audio from video is just one out of many functionalities this app offers.

#### 2. [MP4 to MP3 - Convert Video to Audio](https://play.google.com/store/apps/details?id=mega.video.converter&hl=en)

**Price:**  Free

![MP4 to MP3 Converter app ](https://images.wondershare.com/filmora/article-images/mp4-to-mp3-convert-video-to-audio-cut-ringtones.jpg)

Converting MP4, AVI or MKV video files into MP3s is a fun and easy process. In addition, this app lets you add metadata to each new MP3 file you create which makes organizing huge music libraries painless. What’s more, this MP4 to MP3 converter allows you to cut both audio and video files which makes it a perfect tool for making unique ringtones. The batch conversion feature enables you to convert multiple MP4 files into MP3s at the same time. Even though the MP4 to MP3 app is free, getting rid of ads currently isn’t possible.

#### 3. [Video to MP3 Converter](https://play.google.com/store/apps/details?id=com.naing.mp3converter&hl=en)

**Price:**  Free

![MP4 to MP3 Converter app ](https://images.wondershare.com/filmora/article-images/video-to-mp3-converter-mp3-tagger.jpg)

#### 4. [MP3 Video Converter](https://play.google.com/store/apps/details?id=com.springwalk.mediaconverter)

**Price:**  Free

![MP4 to MP3 Converter app ](https://images.wondershare.com/filmora/article-images/mp3-video-converter.jpg)

Selecting a bitrate of the output file or adding the title of a song and an album won’t take too much of your time. However, the MP3 Video Converter doesn’t offer audio or video editing tools, so you can’t cut or merge several audio files together. What’s more, your device needs ARMv7 in order to run this app, which means that you won’t be able to use it on older models of Android phones.

#### 5. [Video to MP3 Converter – MP3 Cutter and Merger](https://play.google.com/store/apps/details?id=mp3videoconverter.videotomp3.videotomp3converter&hl=en%5FUS)

## Best MP4 to MP3 Apps for iPhones and iPad

Selecting an MP4 to MP3 app for iPhone can be a bit complicated because there are so many apps to choose from. We’ve narrowed down the selection to just five apps in order to make the selection process easier for you, so let's take a look at some of the best MP4 to MP3 apps you can find at the App Store.

#### 1. [Video to MP3 Music Player](https://apps.apple.com/us/app/video-to-mp3-converter-music/id1141413448)

**Price:**  Free, but offers-in app purchases

![MP4 to MP3 Converter app for ios ](https://images.wondershare.com/filmora/article-images/video-to-mp3-music-player.jpg)

Converting an MP4 file from your video library into a high-quality MP3 audio file with this app is a simple 3-step process. You just have to tap on the + button, select a file you want to convert and hit the Convert button. You can also specify the time intervals at which you would like the file conversions to take place and create MP3 files without any quality loss. The app supports all frequently used video file formats, so you can convert videos that are saved in a broad range of formats. As its name indicates, Video to MP3 Music Player lets you play music, and it also enables you to share MP3 files to WhatsApp, Messenger, and other apps.

#### 2. [The Audio Converter](https://apps.apple.com/us/app/the-audio-converter/id889643660)

**Price:**  Free, but offers-in app purchases

![MP4 to MP3 Converter for ios ](https://images.wondershare.com/filmora/article-images/the-audio-converter.jpg)

The Audio Converter app lets you convert both video and audio files to a broad range of audio file formats. You can convert MP4, m4v, amr, MPEG files formats among numerous others to MP3, FLAC, WAV, OGG, and other audio file formats. All conversions take place on a cloud server, which means that you can’t use The Audio Converter while your iPhone is offline. Keep in mind that the free version of the app offers only limited functionalities and you must purchase either Premium Pass or Lifetime Pass if you want to use it to convert MP4 to MP3 on a constant basis.

#### 3. [Video to MP3 – Convert Audio](https://apps.apple.com/us/app/video-to-mp3-convert-audio/id1400653079)

**Price:**  Free, but offers in-app purchases

![MP4 to MP3 Converter for ios ](https://images.wondershare.com/filmora/article-images/video-to-mp3-convert-audio.jpg)

iPhone owners in need of an app that can convert MP4 to MP3 in fifteen seconds should consider installing this app on their devices. You can convert all videos stored on your phone’s camera roll or you can import a video from Dropbox, One Drive, iCloud and other online file hosting platforms. Video to MP3 – Convert Audio lets you set the starting and ending points of the new audio file, which means that you can convert only a portion of an MP4 video file to MP3\. All videos you convert to MP3 can be shared on social media or messaging apps and you can transfer all converted files to a computer using the iTunes File Sharing feature.

#### 4. [MP3 Converter – Audio Extractor](https://apps.apple.com/us/app/mp3-converter-audio-extractor/id1305099161)

**Price:**  Free, but offers in-app purchases

![MP4 to MP3 Converter  for ios](https://images.wondershare.com/filmora/article-images/mp3-converter-audio-extractor.jpg)

Converting a video saved on your phone’s camera roll to MP3 with the MP3 Converter – Audio Extractor requires you to just select a file and start the conversion process. You won’t even have to specify the output format, because MP3 is the app’s default output format. After the conversion, you can listen to the file you created to make sure that its quality is at a satisfying level. However, you won’t have any control over the bitrate of the output file or any other settings that can increase the quality of the MP3 you’re generating. Moreover, the app offers only modest file-sharing options, and you have to make an in-app purchase if you want to gain access to all features the MP3 Converter – Audio Extractor has to offer.

#### 5. [Media Converter – Video to MP3](https://apps.apple.com/us/app/media-converter-video-to-mp3/id1294207675)

**Price:**  Free, but offers in-app purchases

![MP4 to MP3 Converter for ios ](https://images.wondershare.com/filmora/article-images/media-converter-video-to-mp3.jpg)

Besides extracting audio from video, you can use the app’s built-in media player to watch videos or listen to music. Media Converter – Video to MP3 supports a broad range of input file formats and it lets you convert them to MP3, M4A, WAV, and other audio file formats. This app lacks more advanced MP4 to MP3 file conversion options since you can’t select the preferred bitrate of the output files or add tags to them. The app contains ads, and you must make an in-app purchase in order to remove them. Even the Pro version of the Media Converter – Video to MP3 doesn’t offer the file-sharing options.

#### 3. [Video to MP3 – Convert Audio](https://apps.apple.com/us/app/video-to-mp3-convert-audio/id1400653079)
