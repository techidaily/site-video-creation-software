Cartooning a photo is a simple and yet effective way of enhancing a picture and making it more visually appealing. Besides adding an artistic touch to portraits you take, cartooning a photo can also be a great way to have fun with your friends because the results of picture cartooning can be as entertaining as visually striking.

Besides portraiture, this visual effect can be applied to virtually any other genre of photography, although the contents of the shoot usually determine how well the effect is going to work. What’s more, you don’t need a [professional video editing software](https://tools.techidaily.com/wondershare/filmora/download/) to cartoon a photo, since there are so many websites that let you apply this effect to your photos for free.

That’s why we selected some of the best websites for converting a photo into a cartoon.

## 10+ Best Online Cartoon Photo Makers

[Making cartoons](https://tools.techidaily.com/wondershare/filmora/download/) out of photos doesn’t have to be a difficult task that takes a lot of effort to complete. In fact, online cartoon photo makers are easy to use and they don’t require you to have a lot of photo editing experience.

We’ve selected some of the [best online photo editors](https://tools.techidaily.com/wondershare/filmora/download/) and photo converters that enable you to cartoon your photos in just a few clicks.

### Part 1: Best Free Online Cartoon Photo Editors

You don’t have to purchase an expensive photo editing software if you want to cartoon your photos because there are so many different online photo editing platforms that allow you to apply this effect to your photos for free. Let’s take a closer look at what they have to offer.

#### 2. BeFunky

Befunky is one of the best photo editors you can find online, which is why it is hardly surprising that it offers cartoonization effects. In fact, you can choose from **five different cartoonization effects** that are all equally impressive.

All of the cartoon effects Befunky has to offer are located in the Artsy menu, and you just have to click on Cartoonizer DLX, Cross Hatch DLX, Pop Art DLX, or Graphic Novel DLX effects in order to apply them to your photo. Furthermore, you can use the Erase mode if you don’t want to catoonize the entire photo or head over to the Adjust menu to specify the amount of the effect you’ll apply and increase or decrease the photo’s sharpness.

Go to <https://www.befunky.com/features/photo-to-cartoon/> and you can then turn your photos to cartoon easily in BeFunky.

#### 3. Lunapic

This is yet another online photo editing platform that gives you access to a broad range of photo editing options for free. Even though a bit outdated, the Lunapic’s interface resembles Photoshop’s interface, so you won’t need much time to get used to it if you ever used Adobe’s iconic photo editing software.

Once you’ve uploaded a photo, you just have to go to the Effects menu and select the Cartoon option. Lunapic will then automatically apply the effect to the photo you uploaded and you just need to preview the image before you save it. The only downside is that you can’t adjust the effect’s settings in case you don’t like the results.

If you want to add cartoon effect to photo with this photo editor, you can go to <https://www12.lunapic.com/editor/?action=cartoon>.

#### 4. wish2be cartoon photo editor

If you like the caricature you created, you can buy a print or you can choose to share your design for free. The Pro Cartoonizer feature this platform offers is only available if you purchase one of the available subscription plans.

Here is the website <https://www.wish2be.com/app/cartoon-photo-editor/> for cartoon photos with Wish2Be.

#### 5. SnapsTouch

This is a simple online photo editor that lets you turn your photos into sketches, paintings, or drawings. Choosing the Painting option is probably the easiest way to turn a photo into a cartoon, although this effect can also be achieved with the Pencil Sketch feature.

After you upload a photo you want to turn into a cartoon, you can choose between Painting 1 and Painting 2 options in order to determine the style of the cartoon you’re creating. In addition, you can decide if you want to include the outline in the painting as well as set the size of the brush and how many levels the final image should have. Click on the Paint button and wait for SnapsTouch to generate the cartoonized picture, and you can then proceed to download it to your computer.

Moreover, each effect can be adjusted using the Brightness, Contrast, Saturation, and Hue sliders. The only downside is that the platform watermarks all photos you edit with it and you must purchase the PhotoCartoon software in order to remove it.

Want to create cartoons from photos with PhotoCartoon? Visit <https://photocartoon.net/> to get started.

#### 5. Anymaking

This cartoon photo maker offers a basic set of photo editing options so that you can add frames around your pictures, crop, or resize your images and apply photo filters. Besides these tools, Anymaking also features an impressive collection of fun photo effects.

So, you just have to click on the Cartoon effect, and then proceed to upload a picture you want to turn into a cartoon. Once the picture is uploaded you can set the Color Level, Smoothness, and Edge Size values before clicking on the Apply Effect button. You can then save the cartoonized photo to your computer, but you should keep in mind that you must enable Flash in your browser in order to use the Anymaking online photo editor.

You can go to <https://anymaking.com/fun-cartoon-photo-maker-effects> to add cartoon effect to photo to

#### 6. Picture to People

Picture to People is much more than a simple photo to cartoon converter, as the platform features a photo editor, text customization tools, and a broad range of other photo editing options. You just have to upload a photo in order to start converting it. After the picture is uploaded you can adjust Color Improvement, Color Detail, Contour Style, and Contour Strength options.

In addition, you can choose whether or not you want to make a soft drawing. In case you do, you can adjust the Softness Level and Softness Extent values and then click on the Generate button. The platform will take a few moments to cartoonize your photo, but you can only download the photo to your computer since Picture to People doesn’t have social sharing options.

Go to <http://www.picturetopeople.org/image\_effects/photo\_cartoon/photo\_cartoon.html> to convert photos to cartoons with the Picture to People converter.

#### 7. cartoon.pho.to

In addition to the Cartoon effect, the pho.to platform also features the Cartoons mode that cartoonizes photos automatically. Once you upload a picture from Facebook, your hard drive, or via an URL the platform will generate a preview where you can see how your cartoonized photo looks. Besides the Cartoon effect, this mode also offers the Face Morphing and Face Auto Crop options.

You should click on the Save and Share button if you like the result. However, fine-tuning the effect’s settings isn’t possible, so there isn’t much you can do if you didn’t like the results of cartoonization. Optionally you can open the photo you turned into a cartoon in the platform’s editor and add text layers, stickers or tweak the brightness and contrast values.

Visit <https://cartoon.pho.to/> to use the cartoon.pho.to tool.

#### 8. Prima Cartoonizer

All you need to do after you arrive at the Prima Cartoonizer’s home page is click on the Choose File button and the platform’s editor will launch as soon as the upload is completed. You can then start browsing through the huge collection of cartoon effects.

Once you find the effect you like you should click on it in order to apply it to your photo and then preview the results. Adjusting the effect’s settings is not possible, and some cartoon effects are only available on the desktop version of the app. Moreover, all photos you cartoonize on this platform are watermarked and you must install Prima Cartoonizer on your computer if you want to create watermark-free cartoons from your photos.

Want to convert photos to cartoons with Prima Cartoonizer, go to <https://primacartoonizer.com/>.

**Conclusion**

Online cartoon photo editors and converters are remarkably easy to use, and they enable you to turn any photo you take into an entertaining cartoon in just a few clicks. However, some of these online platforms watermark your pictures and don’t allow you to adjust the effect’s settings, which impact the quality of the final cartoonized photo.

## Part 2: Best Free Online Video Trimmer for Windows 10

Trimming the unnecessary parts of the video is the need of the hour. However, some people don't prefer downloading a tool for it. So, the following online video trimmers for windows 10 can assist them in their job:

### 2\. [Online Video Cutter](https://online-video-cutter.com/)

![online video cutter trimmer](https://images.wondershare.com/filmora/article-images/online-video-cutter-trimmer.jpg)

Online Video Cutter allows you to trim easily, crop, and twist videos, as well as modify the playing speed. It functions in any browser — tested it in Safari on the Mac, which isn't frequently recognized by online tools, and it worked flawlessly – and the only restriction is that your file size cannot exceed 500MB.

You may export in MP4, MKV, or MOV format. It does not require any sign up from the user to trim the video and nor does it leave any watermark on the video after editing.

Features:

* Supports every kind of browser
* It does not leave any watermark
* Offers a quick no-encode alternative

### 3\. [Kapwing](https://www.kapwing.com/)

![kapwing trim video online](https://images.wondershare.com/filmora/article-images/kapwing-trim-video-online.jpg)

Kapwing is a straightforward online video editor. It displays a preview of your video on the left side of the screen, and users can use the scales or timeouts to choose the start and finish times of their cut.

Kapwing is a premium service, which means free users can only upload files up to 250MB in size, and exports may only be 7 minutes long. There's no need to register yourself for editing the videos through Kapwing, but it does leave a watermark.

Features:

* Allows you to preview the video
* It is quite simple to use for editing
* It does not require any sign up before trimming

### 4\. [Adobe Creative Cloud Express](https://www.adobe.com/express/)

Adobe Creative Cloud Express is the best free online video trimmer windows 10 available for making simple modifications to videos. It enables the creation, editing, and sharing of new projects from any device. It recognizes original edit spots automatically and works with all AVI, MXF, and other file formats. Furthermore, the curve is managed automatically by this online video trimmer.

However, it needs registration to edit the video, and the free version leaves a watermark.

Features:

* It reformats the video automatically.
* It enables the editing platform to be expanded.
* It integrates with other apps and services without a hitch.

![adobe express trim video interface](https://images.wondershare.com/filmora/article-images/adobe-express-trim-video-interface.jpg)

![clipchamp trim video online windows chrome](https://images.wondershare.com/filmora/article-images/clipchamp-trim-video-online-windows-chrome.jpg)

Clipchamp is a freemium service, which means it has a free tier, but the finest features are only available to paying users. Your video output is restricted to general standards at 480p quality.

Since Safari does not support Clipchamp, you must use the Chrome or Edge browser on a Mac. Users need to register themselves for editing the videos through Clipchamp. The free version also leaves a watermark on the video.

Features:

* Helps the user to add audio and video
* Lets you export the video to social media platforms
* Offers multiple editing features for the video

### 6\. [Clideo](https://clideo.com/cut-video)

Clideo provides several online tools for looping, flipping, reversing, and filtering video clips, adding subtitles, resizing clips, and creating memes. Each tool is a standalone application running in your internet browser.

There are file size restrictions while using the free version, i.e., 500MB or fewer files, as with other online services. A Pro subscription, which costs $9 per month, allows you access to the full version. Clideo does not need registration, but the free version leaves a watermark.

Features:

* Excellent editing features in the free version
* Helps you add subtitles to the video
* Allows you to compress/resize the video
