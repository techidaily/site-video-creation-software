One of the main benefits of using a light video editor is its simplicity and ease of use. It can be a great option for beginners or those who need to quickly edit and produce videos without spending a lot of time learning a complex software. It is also usually more affordable than a full-featured video editor and can still produce high-quality videos for personal or professional use.
