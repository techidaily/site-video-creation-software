You can find more details about [how to blur the background in the portrait video with Filmora](https://tools.techidaily.com/wondershare/filmora/download/).

**Conclusion**

If you want to have full control over the post-production process, having an efficient desktop program like Wondershare Filmora X would be something you might be looking for. On the other hand, if you are not a professional editor or are not much into editing and prefer playing around with the tools for personal use, going for a decent web portal to **blur video online** is your best bet.
