* Click your preferred character from the AI-generated faces, and then click **Download** from the page that opens next. Choose your preferred method to sign up, and then sign in to download the virtual face to your PC.

### 2\. Generated Photos: Anonymizer

**Website**: <https://generated.photos/anonymizer>

Anonymizer is another section from the Generated Photos portal that allows you to upload your image. Then it uses AI technology to generate similar virtual faces that you can download and use wherever needed.

However, sometimes the pictures that the website creates may not resemble your face as closely as you expect them to be, but that’s OK. Isn’t it? The main idea is to keep your privacy intact, and that’s what Generated Photos: Anonymizer does.

You can learn how to use this section by following the instructions given below:

* Use the URL given above to get to the Anonymizer’s web page and then click **Upload photo;**
* Select and upload your photo from your PC to the portal and wait while Anonymizer uses AI to generate similar faces.
* Click the photo that you want to use, and when the next page opens up, click Sign up or sign in to download the photo and use it wherever needed

### 3\. Generated Photos Face Generator

Website: [](https://generated.photos/face-generator)<https://generated.photos/face-generator>

This online face generator from Generated Photos allows you to create a unique realt-time face from scratch in one click. And if you don’t like the face generated, you can change the parameters such as gender, skin tone, hair, eye and head pose.

Below is a brief tutorial about how to generate a face with it step by step:

### 4\. Massless

**Website:** [https://massless.io/tool/face-maker-ai](https://massless.io/tool/face-maker-ai/)

Massless allows you to use its tools to sketch a portrait, and then it uses AI technology to generate a virtual face out of your drawing. However, because you can’t always be precise while sketching with the mouse, it would be good to have access to a digital drawing pad to create the faces with a pen. With Massless, you can explore your creativity to the full and draw beautiful faces to use them as your avatar.

You can follow the procedure given below to use Massless to draw virtual faces:

* Open a web browser, and visit the URL given above. Click any icons from the toolbox at the top (E.g., **Nose**).
* Draw a shape on its corresponding face area on the left (E.g., **Nose**), and wait while the portal automatically updates the photo on the right.
* Repeat the process to sketch other parts of the face, and click the More icon (with three vertical dots) from the top-right corner.
* Click **Download images** from the page that opens next to download the photo to your PC and use it wherever needed.

### 5\. This Person Does Not Exist

**Website:** <https://thispersondoesnotexist.com/>

This free online virtual face generator is probably the easiest and quickest. As you go to the website, it displays a random realistic image of a person that may not exist. If you don’t like the idea, you can change it with merely a single mouse click. Because the portal doesn’t have any Download button at the time of this writing, you must rely on the web browser’s default downloading process to get the image to your PC.

You can follow the instructions that are given below to switch between the images and download the one you like:

* Use your preferred web browser (Google Chrome here) to visit the URL provided above, and then notice the random image that appears on the page;
* Click **Another** from the box that appears at the bottom-right corner to change the image, repeat this process until you find a good photo for your avatar, and then right-click anywhere on the image.
* Click **Save image** from the context menu to save the photo. And then go to the default download folder to access the downloaded image, and use the picture wherever needed.

**Note:** Different browsers may have this feature with other names

### 6\. BoredHumans

**Website**: <https://boredhumans.com/faces.php>

This web portal is identical to the previous one as it generates random virtual faces with merely one mouse click. Even this website doesn’t have any Download button to help you download the image. Therefore, you must use the browser’s built-in feature to obtain the photo you want to save to your PC.

You can learn how to use BoredHumans to generate virtual faces and download them to your computer by following the steps given below:

* Open a web browser (Google Chrome here) and visit the URL provided above, and then click **Generate Another Fake Human** if you don’t like the one that appears;
* Keep clicking the button until you find a face that can be used as your avatar. Alternatively, you can click the **Generate A Human** button to create a less realistic image of a random person.

![free online face generators boredhumans](https://images.wondershare.com/filmora/article-images/free-online-face-generators-boredhumans.jpg)

* Right-click the image and click **Save image** to download the photo to your PC; and then get to the default download location to access the photo and use it wherever needed.

### 7\. faceMaker

**Website**: <https://facemaker.uvrg.org/>

faceMaker allows you to generate virtual faces out of the fine details that you specify during the creation process. These details are adjusted using the sliders that affect the corresponding physical attributes of the avatars. For example, you can modify the lips, eye color, hair, face roundness, mouse depth, jaw shape, etc. using their respective sliders.

You can follow the steps that are given below to learn how to create a virtual face using faceMaker, and save it to your PC to use it as an avatar:

* Use your preferred web browser to visit the URL given above and click **Start** from the main page.
* Fill out the questionnaire by choosing your preferred options and agreeing to the term and conditions.
* Click **Start** and then click **Continue** on the next page. Use the sliders on the left and right panels to customize the face as needed, and once done, you can use any screen capturing tool to take a snapshot and remove the sliders by cropping the image, thus having only the virtual face.

![free online face generators facemaker](https://images.wondershare.com/filmora/article-images/free-online-face-generators-facemaker.jpg)

* Save the cropped photo on your PC, and then back on the webpage, click **Finished** from the bottom-right corner.

![facemaker online face generators face](https://images.wondershare.com/filmora/article-images/facemaker-online-face-generators-face.jpg)

* On the next page, choose the radio buttons according to your choice. Once done, click **Yes, submit now** from the bottom to submit the customized virtual face to the portal.

![download facemaker online face generators face](https://images.wondershare.com/filmora/article-images/download-facemaker-online-face-generators-face.jpg)

**Conclusion**

With all the cybercrime reports circulating everywhere nowadays, it is important to stay cautious about what you post on any social media website. To add an extra layer of security, you can avoid using your real photograph as a profile picture, and go with the fake faces instead. You can generate these virtual faces using any of the free online face generator websites, some of which even allow you to define the shape of a face quite minutely. Because the generated faces are not of any real human, they can be used as your avatar without any risk.

![aspect ratio calculators](https://images.wondershare.com/filmora/article-images/2021/best-5-aspect-ratio-calculator-online-1.jpg)

With this guide of the best five **aspect ratio calculators online** we've put together for you, you cannot go wrong!

#### In this article

01 [Typical Aspect Ratios and Sizes of Screens and Videos](#Part 1)

02 [How Do I Know the Aspect Ratio of My Video?](#Part 2)

03 [How Can I Change the Aspect Ratio of an Image Online?](#Part 3)

04 [How to Change the Aspect Ratio in Filmora/Filmora Pro?](#Part 4)

## Part 1 Part 1: Typical Aspect Ratios and Sizes of Screens and Videos

An aspect ratio is a measurement representing the ratio between the width and height of a screen or a video. It determines the length of your video or screen. Not only screens and videos, but you can use the concept also in images.

And, it is written as 'x:y' where 'x' is the width and 'y' is the height.

There isn't any one-size-fits-all when we need to use the video aspect ratios. Aspect ratios are generally selected based on where the video will post, how it will be visible, and what aim it usually serves.

Videos utilized for social media will vary from trailers shows or movies shown in theaters. There are common aspect ratios for modern televisions, but broadcasters can consider using the aspect ratio that operates great with their audience and content.

Since most videos showcase through standard online video platforms, custom aspect ratios are not commonly used.

Here are a few standard aspect ratios that you can use for live streaming and other video creation:

![aspect ratios](https://images.wondershare.com/filmora/article-images/2021/best-5-aspect-ratio-calculator-online-2.jpg)

**16:9**

A 16:9 aspect ratio represents a wide rectangle. It is also called "1.71:1," the most accessible form of the ratio, mathematically speaking.

This ratio is mainly used in video creation and streaming and is considered the international standard format for cinema and television.

Many also tend to use this highly famous aspect ratio on their sites.

It is also more cost-effective to use screens compatible with this ratio instead of their predecessors. The standardization of computer monitors and televisions saved producers both the money and time spent in the research field.

One of the ideal resolutions you can use with a 16:9 aspect ratio is 4Kor 3840 pixels by 2160 pixels.

**1:1**

The 1:1 video aspect ratio is one of the ideal squares used with square television sets.

It is much less in demand but usually visible on social media platforms like Facebook or Instagram.

Many cameras still have a square setting even though it's not the most commonly used aspect ratio.

**4:3**

The 4:3 aspect ratio was the general screen size for computer monitors and televisions before 16:9 and 16:10\. The reason for the switch was the HDTV birth. It's because the 16:9 and 16:10 aspect ratios allow for better resolutions than 4:3 do.

This aspect ratio was still considered for Apple iPads until they released the 2018 iPad Pro.

**3:2**

The 3:2 aspect ratio was primarily seen in classic 35 mm still photography still used on tablets, laptops, and various game consoles in the handheld form.

Many micro- to medium-sized cameras still use the 3:2 aspect ratio settings, but broadcasters rarely use it today.

**21:9**

The 21:9 aspect ratios have a pretty specific purpose. It is often called cinematic widescreen or ultra-widescreen.

It is also helpful for films with an anamorphic format. Anamorphic format videos create an optical illusion that offers a 360-degree view.

You are likely to look for the videos with this aspect ratio in notable museums, theme parks, theaters, and the like.

**9:16**

A 9:16 aspect ratio is for tall videos. This aspect ratio became famous after the launch of smartphones with video capabilities.

For instance, the optimal measure for an Instagram story is 1080 px by 1920 px, and thus its ratio comes out as 9:16\. The same goes for other famous apps with "story" features, including Snapchat and Facebook.

This makes sense because the iPhone camera's video setting can record footage in both 16:9 and 9:16.

## Part 2 How Do I Know the Aspect Ratio of My Video?

![aspect ratios](https://images.wondershare.com/filmora/article-images/2021/best-5-aspect-ratio-calculator-online-3.jpg)

Most cameras with video capabilities are available with various aspect ratio settings. This helps you decide which aspect ratio you'd like your video to have before recording it.

If you are looking to determine the aspect ratio of a video already shot, you can easily access additional information for the file.

The information button is a small "i" in a circle on Mac. Move on to right-click a file and select "**Properties**" on your PC.

It may give you the actual width and height of the video, but you can divide the two to find the aspect ratio.

However, you don't need to hassle as we'll enlist the best five **aspect ratio** **calculators online** below.

02 [How Do I Know the Aspect Ratio of My Video?](#Part 2)

03 [How Can I Change the Aspect Ratio of an Image Online?](#Part 3)

04 [How to Change the Aspect Ratio in Filmora/Filmora Pro?](#Part 4)

## Part 1 Part 1: Typical Aspect Ratios and Sizes of Screens and Videos

An aspect ratio is a measurement representing the ratio between the width and height of a screen or a video. It determines the length of your video or screen. Not only screens and videos, but you can use the concept also in images.

And, it is written as 'x:y' where 'x' is the width and 'y' is the height.

There isn't any one-size-fits-all when we need to use the video aspect ratios. Aspect ratios are generally selected based on where the video will post, how it will be visible, and what aim it usually serves.

Videos utilized for social media will vary from trailers shows or movies shown in theaters. There are common aspect ratios for modern televisions, but broadcasters can consider using the aspect ratio that operates great with their audience and content.

Since most videos showcase through standard online video platforms, custom aspect ratios are not commonly used.

Here are a few standard aspect ratios that you can use for live streaming and other video creation:

![aspect ratios](https://images.wondershare.com/filmora/article-images/2021/best-5-aspect-ratio-calculator-online-2.jpg)

**16:9**

A 16:9 aspect ratio represents a wide rectangle. It is also called "1.71:1," the most accessible form of the ratio, mathematically speaking.

This ratio is mainly used in video creation and streaming and is considered the international standard format for cinema and television.

Many also tend to use this highly famous aspect ratio on their sites.

It is also more cost-effective to use screens compatible with this ratio instead of their predecessors. The standardization of computer monitors and televisions saved producers both the money and time spent in the research field.

One of the ideal resolutions you can use with a 16:9 aspect ratio is 4Kor 3840 pixels by 2160 pixels.

**1:1**

The 1:1 video aspect ratio is one of the ideal squares used with square television sets.

It is much less in demand but usually visible on social media platforms like Facebook or Instagram.

Many cameras still have a square setting even though it's not the most commonly used aspect ratio.

**4:3**

The 4:3 aspect ratio was the general screen size for computer monitors and televisions before 16:9 and 16:10\. The reason for the switch was the HDTV birth. It's because the 16:9 and 16:10 aspect ratios allow for better resolutions than 4:3 do.

This aspect ratio was still considered for Apple iPads until they released the 2018 iPad Pro.

**3:2**

The 3:2 aspect ratio was primarily seen in classic 35 mm still photography still used on tablets, laptops, and various game consoles in the handheld form.

Many micro- to medium-sized cameras still use the 3:2 aspect ratio settings, but broadcasters rarely use it today.

**21:9**

The 21:9 aspect ratios have a pretty specific purpose. It is often called cinematic widescreen or ultra-widescreen.

It is also helpful for films with an anamorphic format. Anamorphic format videos create an optical illusion that offers a 360-degree view.

You are likely to look for the videos with this aspect ratio in notable museums, theme parks, theaters, and the like.

**9:16**

A 9:16 aspect ratio is for tall videos. This aspect ratio became famous after the launch of smartphones with video capabilities.

For instance, the optimal measure for an Instagram story is 1080 px by 1920 px, and thus its ratio comes out as 9:16\. The same goes for other famous apps with "story" features, including Snapchat and Facebook.

This makes sense because the iPhone camera's video setting can record footage in both 16:9 and 9:16.

## Part 2 How Do I Know the Aspect Ratio of My Video?

![aspect ratios](https://images.wondershare.com/filmora/article-images/2021/best-5-aspect-ratio-calculator-online-3.jpg)

Most cameras with video capabilities are available with various aspect ratio settings. This helps you decide which aspect ratio you'd like your video to have before recording it.

If you are looking to determine the aspect ratio of a video already shot, you can easily access additional information for the file.

The information button is a small "i" in a circle on Mac. Move on to right-click a file and select "**Properties**" on your PC.

It may give you the actual width and height of the video, but you can divide the two to find the aspect ratio.

However, you don't need to hassle as we'll enlist the best five **aspect ratio** **calculators online** below.

## The Best Video Editing Apps for Mac: Simplify Your Video Creation Process

# Best Video Maker for Mac: Easily make videos on Mac

![author avatar](https://images.wondershare.com/filmora/article-images/ollie-mattison.jpg)

##### Ollie Mattison

 Mar 27, 2024• Proven solutions

Finding a good video maker for Mac is not always easy – not for lack of options, there are many applications out there, but there are **two main limitations**: money, first and foremost, we all know how expensive video makers – good video makers – can be. The second limitation is complexity: sometimes you end up spending more time reading the help instead of editing, and the application you've chosen probably contains the features that you need – except that you have serious problems finding them on the menu.

[1\. Wondershare Filmora Video Maker for Mac](#part1)  
[2\. iMovie](#part2)  
[3\. Blender](#part3)

## Best Video Maker for Mac

Some video makers manage to stay on top by avoiding, or at least limiting these problems, and here are three of those.

### 1.Vieo Maker on Mac: [Wondershare Filmora Video Maker for Mac](https://tools.techidaily.com/wondershare/filmora/download/)

Wondershare Filmora for Mac offers perhaps the best value for money (not to mention that it has a free version as well if you'd like to try it first. It supports pretty much any format you may think of (AVI, MP4, MOV, MPG, MKV, TRP, and so on), and it's quite easy to use when it comes to the most basic features you'd expect in a video editor, such as cropping, joining, trimming, and rotating, as well as for adding some effects, transitions, and sound effects.

Because of that, Wondershare Filmora may actually be deceptively simple – because it's capable of much more powerful features, if you take your time to study all its options, such as **picture in picture, green screen**, if you fancy yourself the next Hollywood director, adjustable playback speed, separation of the audio track from the original video file, tilt-shift effects, which can create very interesting results in a video, automatic noise reduction, and image enhancement, to bring back to life the subjects of the video, and automatic scene detection – allowing you to create a new video clip every time a scene changes. And there are a lot more things you can discover for yourself if you spend some time playing around.

Wondershare Filmora will also allow you to upload your creations directly to **Facebook or YouTube**, or to burn them on DVDs, so you can get straight into the next project without wasting any time.

[![Download Win Version](https://images.wondershare.com/filmora/guide/download-btn-win.jpg)](https://tools.techidaily.com/wondershare/filmora/download/)[![Download Mac Version](https://images.wondershare.com/filmora/guide/download-btn-mac.jpg)](https://tools.techidaily.com/wondershare/filmora/download/)

### 2\. Video Maker for Mac: iMovie

iMovie is the proprietary software provided by Apple as part of its iLife suit. You may find it already installed on your Mac if you've just purchased a new machine. If not, it's free to use after you purchase iLife.

It's not the most powerful and complex application out there, as you can imagine for a piece of software that comes pre-installed, but it's a good first stop for people who are just starting out in this field and need to learn the basics of editing videos on Mac without too many headaches.

It has many easy-to-use effects and lots of build-in animations, music samples, and sounds to get you started on your first project immediately.

Granted, iMovie has sacrificed a lot of features for the simplicity of use – sooner or later you'll want to move on to something more complex, but, for beginners and for people who just need to add a few editing touches to a project here and there, this is a more than the reasonable solution. Don't let yourself put off by the fact iMovie has a rather bad reputation online – of course, that very advanced users are disappointed by it, but you can use it for a while and you'll know when it's time to move on.

### 3\. Video Maker on Mac: Blender

When you've exhausted the possibilities offered by iMovie and you need more power, Blender will be there, waiting for you. It's by far the most impressive of the free video makers for Mac – it's an open-source program, developed by the community – so it's always free to use, you won't stumble upon any hidden charges later on.

Like all open source applications, Blender is not the most intuitive at the first glance, but it more than compensates with the impressive range of features that bring it to the same level as a professional application. If you've been struggling to get everything just perfect before, now you'll have everything you need at your fingertips and you only need to unleash your imagination. It's 3D modeling options have been frequently compared to those that can only be found in applications that cost more than your Mac (maybe even more than your car, come to think of it).

Moreover, the community will always be there for you – if you have any questions or if you get stuck, you only need to post a question online and somebody will be there to help you out – not to mention the very large number of tutorials available online, with more being added almost daily.

If you're not sure about this, you may want to start by searching online for clips created entirely with Blender. Of course, yours won't be masterpieces from day one, it will take some time to get used to this application – but you'll get some idea of how powerful it can be, and the level of mastery that you'll want to achieve, eventually.

Finding a good video maker for Mac is not always easy – not for lack of options, there are many applications out there, but there are **two main limitations**: money, first and foremost, we all know how expensive video makers – good video makers – can be. The second limitation is complexity: sometimes you end up spending more time reading the help instead of editing, and the application you've chosen probably contains the features that you need – except that you have serious problems finding them on the menu.

[1\. Wondershare Filmora Video Maker for Mac](#part1)  
[2\. iMovie](#part2)  
[3\. Blender](#part3)

## Best Video Maker for Mac

Some video makers manage to stay on top by avoiding, or at least limiting these problems, and here are three of those.

### 1.Vieo Maker on Mac: [Wondershare Filmora Video Maker for Mac](https://tools.techidaily.com/wondershare/filmora/download/)

Wondershare Filmora for Mac offers perhaps the best value for money (not to mention that it has a free version as well if you'd like to try it first. It supports pretty much any format you may think of (AVI, MP4, MOV, MPG, MKV, TRP, and so on), and it's quite easy to use when it comes to the most basic features you'd expect in a video editor, such as cropping, joining, trimming, and rotating, as well as for adding some effects, transitions, and sound effects.

Because of that, Wondershare Filmora may actually be deceptively simple – because it's capable of much more powerful features, if you take your time to study all its options, such as **picture in picture, green screen**, if you fancy yourself the next Hollywood director, adjustable playback speed, separation of the audio track from the original video file, tilt-shift effects, which can create very interesting results in a video, automatic noise reduction, and image enhancement, to bring back to life the subjects of the video, and automatic scene detection – allowing you to create a new video clip every time a scene changes. And there are a lot more things you can discover for yourself if you spend some time playing around.

Wondershare Filmora will also allow you to upload your creations directly to **Facebook or YouTube**, or to burn them on DVDs, so you can get straight into the next project without wasting any time.

### 2\. Video Maker for Mac: iMovie

iMovie is the proprietary software provided by Apple as part of its iLife suit. You may find it already installed on your Mac if you've just purchased a new machine. If not, it's free to use after you purchase iLife.

It's not the most powerful and complex application out there, as you can imagine for a piece of software that comes pre-installed, but it's a good first stop for people who are just starting out in this field and need to learn the basics of editing videos on Mac without too many headaches.

It has many easy-to-use effects and lots of build-in animations, music samples, and sounds to get you started on your first project immediately.

Granted, iMovie has sacrificed a lot of features for the simplicity of use – sooner or later you'll want to move on to something more complex, but, for beginners and for people who just need to add a few editing touches to a project here and there, this is a more than the reasonable solution. Don't let yourself put off by the fact iMovie has a rather bad reputation online – of course, that very advanced users are disappointed by it, but you can use it for a while and you'll know when it's time to move on.

### 3\. Video Maker on Mac: Blender

When you've exhausted the possibilities offered by iMovie and you need more power, Blender will be there, waiting for you.
