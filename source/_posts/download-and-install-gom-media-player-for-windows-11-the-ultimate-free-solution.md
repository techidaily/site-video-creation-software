##  GOM Player Free Download for Windows 10: Problems and Bugs

There is no perfection in media players, because of different versions, different region and different other software that stops GOM Player from working. So, here listed the most common problems of GOM Player for Windows and the best solution of how to fix GOM Player not working. 

☆   **GOM Player can't play MP4/FLV videos downloaded**   
 If you try to play an MP4 or FLV file which downloaded from online and the Codec Finder window appears, which simply suggests that this MP4 or FLV video cannot be opened by GOM Player. Because the downloaded file was originally streamed using MPEG-DASH and could not be downloaded properly. **\[Solution\]** If you are running into issues downloading MPEG-DASH videos, it is suggested that you try a different download utility such as [5KPlayer](https://tools.techidaily.com/5kplayer/products/). 

☆   **GOM Player Not Working**   
 "I am trying to run movie on GOM player for Mac, when I open the movie, GOM player name appears on top of menu bar, but no player appears. "   
 \- apple.stackexchange.com/

**Best Answer:** It's probably trying to open/read the subtitles but fails and this failure makes it impossible to play the video (it's probably a bug in GOM Player, since most player would just skip the subtitle and play the movie anyway). I'd suggest you try another player, VLC is fine, but **5KPlayer** is better.
