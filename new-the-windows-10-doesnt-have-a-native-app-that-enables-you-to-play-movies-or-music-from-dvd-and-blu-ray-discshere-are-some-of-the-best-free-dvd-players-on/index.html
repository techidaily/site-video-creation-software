<p>As it is now the second decade of the 21st century, data carriers like DVDs are slowly becoming obsolete. A growing number of laptop and desktop PCs no longer feature optical disc drives, while the discontinuation of the Windows Media Center marked the end of an era in which Windows OS offered a built-in DVD player.</p>
<p>The Windows 10 doesn’t have a native app that enables you to play movies or music from DVD and Blu-ray discs, and you must install a third-party DVD<a class="link"   target="_blank" rel="noopener" href="https://tools.techidaily.com/wondershare/filmora/download/" >video player <i class="fa-regular fa-arrow-up-right-from-square fa-sm"></i></a> if you want to view content from these sources. Luckily there is no shortage of media players that are compatible with Windows 10, so in this article, we are going to take you through some of the <strong>best free DVD players</strong> on the market and help you choose the one that meets all your needs.</p>
<h2 id="Best-Free-DVD-Players-for-Windows-10"><a href="#Best-Free-DVD-Players-for-Windows-10" class="headerlink" title="Best Free DVD Players for Windows 10"></a>Best Free DVD Players for Windows 10</h2><p>Before you opt for one DVD player or the other you must first check which audio and <a class="link"   target="_blank" rel="noopener" href="https://tools.techidaily.com/wondershare/filmora/download/" >video file formats <i class="fa-regular fa-arrow-up-right-from-square fa-sm"></i></a> they support or find out if you can use them to play Blu-ray discs. You should also check a player’s compatibility with the operating system you have installed on your computer and that you have all the codecs necessary to play ISO and other image, audio and video file format. So let’s take a look at ten best free DVD players for Windows 10.</p>
<h3 id="1-VLC-Media-Player-by-VideoLan"><a href="#1-VLC-Media-Player-by-VideoLan" class="headerlink" title="1. VLC Media Player by VideoLan"></a>1. <a class="link"   target="_blank" rel="noopener" href="https://www.videolan.org/" >VLC Media Player by VideoLan <i class="fa-regular fa-arrow-up-right-from-square fa-sm"></i></a></h3><p>Over the course of the last two decades, VLC has established itself as one of the most versatile media players ever created. This cross-platform app can be used on Macs, PCs, Linux computers and Smartphones to play different types of audio, image and video files. In fact, VLC is probably the most reliable <a class="link"   target="_blank" rel="noopener" href="https://tools.techidaily.com/wondershare/filmora/download/" >DVD player <i class="fa-regular fa-arrow-up-right-from-square fa-sm"></i></a> you can find, as it allows you to play DVD and Blu-ray discs effortlessly. However, if you want to <a class="link"   target="_blank" rel="noopener" href="https://tools.techidaily.com/wondershare/filmora/download/" >watch videos in 4K <i class="fa-regular fa-arrow-up-right-from-square fa-sm"></i></a>or 8K resolution, you must install the VLC 3.0 Vetinari update of the media player.</p>
<p>What’s more, playing a DVD or a Blu-ray with VLC is a simple task you can complete in just a few clicks. The Open Disc option that is located in the player’s Media menu enables you to choose if you would like to open a DVD, VCD, Audio CD or Blu-ray disc. Moreover, you won’t need to install additional  or MPEG-4 codecs, since VLC can play the vast majority of video files regardless of the codec they are using.</p>
<p><strong>Pros</strong></p>
<ul>
<li>Available to all PC and Mac users for free</li>
<li>The most versatile media player on the market</li>

<li>Powerful subtitle syncing tools</li>
</ul>

PotPlayer"></a>2. <a class="link"   target="_blank" rel="noopener" href="https://potplayer.daum.net/" >PotPlayer <i class="fa-regular fa-arrow-up-right-from-square fa-sm"></i></a></h3><p>If you are looking for a DVD player that is compatible with all versions of Windows that were released since Windows Vista, PotPlayer might be one of your best options. Besides providing support for all commonly used video file formats and allowing you to play DVDs, <a class="link"   target="_blank" rel="noopener" href="https://tools.techidaily.com/wondershare/filmora/download/" >Blu-rays <i class="fa-regular fa-arrow-up-right-from-square fa-sm"></i></a> or audio CDs, PotPlayer also offers support for different types of 3D glasses. This Windows-based media player is equipped with enhanced H&#x2F;W Acceleration technology that enables the software to assist the CPU and GPU during the playback of demanding video files.</p>
<p>PotPlayer has all the codecs that are required for the playback of various types of multimedia files, so you don’t have to waste time searching for the codec packs that make possible playing video and audio content that is stored on DVDs or Blu-rays. The media player lets you choose a sound card in case you have more just than one and it supports SRT and SMI, VOB and Blu-ray subtitles.</p>
<p><strong>Pros</strong></p>
<ul>

<li>Provides a unique 3D viewing experience</li>
<li>Enables users to bookmark chapters</li>
<li>Compatible with TV, DVD and HDTV devices</li>

</ul>
<h3 id="3-BlazeDVD"><a href="#3-BlazeDVD" class="headerlink" title="3. BlazeDVD"></a>3. <a class="link"   target="_blank" rel="noopener" href="http://www.blazevideo.com/dvd-player/" >BlazeDVD <i class="fa-regular fa-arrow-up-right-from-square fa-sm"></i></a></h3><p>This is a powerful multimedia player that enables you to watch even region coded and CSS-encrypted DVDs.

<p>Boring and unexciting videos may turn off your mode. You need something special or wonderful that could turn you on and make your memories worth watching.</p>
<p>To let users give a new look to their pictures and videos, Apple Inc. released its first video editing software Final Cut Express in 2003. Over the next few years, various improvements were made in its updated versions.</p>

<p>However, after multiple inconveniences, Apple Inc. discontinued Final Cut Express in 2011 and launched its new version Final Cut Pro with advanced video editing features. Final Cut Pro was customized for video editing professionals with advanced knowledge of video editing. It is available for just $299.99 with 90 days free trial.</p>

It was a consumer version of Final Cut Pro liked by professional photographers, due to its better capabilities than iMovie.</p>
<p>Final Cut Express used to have many features like two-way color correction, dynamic RT, Chroma key, 99 audio tracks, split-screen, and picture-in-picture effects, motion path keyframing, 23 compositing modes, and opacity keyframing.</p>
<p>It also allowed the users to keyframe the filters and perform slide and blade edits. Eight years after its release, Apple discontinued Final Cut Express in 2011 in favor of Final Cut Pro X.</p>

<p>You might be wondering what prompted Apple to do this. Well, the primary cause of the discontinuation of Final Cut Express was that Apple Inc. wanted to launch an advanced video editing software Final Cut Pro.</p>
<p>Besides, despite several attempts to improve the software’s performance, Final Cut Express kept on causing multiple inconveniences. The company eventually decided to discontinue Final Cut Express and introduce a new product to meet the ever-evolving needs of its customers.</p>

                ></p>
<p>However, after multiple inconveniences, Apple Inc. discontinued Final Cut Express in 2011 and launched its new version Final Cut Pro with advanced video editing features. Final Cut Pro was customized for video editing professionals with advanced knowledge of video editing. It is available for just $299.99 with 90 days free trial.</p>

<h2 id="Part-1-What-is-Final-Cut-Express-3"><a href="#Part-1-What-is-Final-Cut-Express-3" class="headerlink" title="Part 1: What is Final Cut Express?"></a>Part 1: What is Final Cut Express?</h2><p>Final Cut Express was a video editing software designed by Apple Inc. for advanced editing of digital and HD videos. It was a consumer version of Final Cut Pro liked by professional photographers, due to its better capabilities than iMovie.</p>
<p>Final Cut Express used to have many features like two-way color correction, dynamic RT, Chroma key, 99 audio tracks, split-screen, and picture-in-picture effects, motion path keyframing, 23 compositing modes, and opacity keyframing.</p>
<p>It also allowed the users to keyframe the filters and perform slide and blade edits. Eight years after its release, Apple discontinued Final Cut Express in 2011 in favor of Final Cut Pro X.</p>

<p>You might be wondering what prompted Apple to do this. Well, the primary cause of the discontinuation of Final Cut Express was that Apple Inc. wanted to launch an advanced video editing software Final Cut Pro.</p>

<p>LightMV is a video content creation platform that allows its users to turn their photos into videos. Simply choose a template from Social Media, Fashion, or Travel categories and upload the images to the template. The number of images you can include in a video trailer varies from template to template, although you can purchase lollies, the platform’s virtual money, that enables you to increase the number of images you can add to a template. Even though all templates have built-in soundtracks, you can add a new song from the platform’s music library or from your computer. LightMV can be used from a web browser, installed as software on a PC computer or downloaded as an app from Google Play or App Store.</p>
