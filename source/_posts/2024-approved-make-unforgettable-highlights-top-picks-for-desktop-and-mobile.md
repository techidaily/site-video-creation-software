![author avatar](https://images.wondershare.com/filmora/article-images/shannon-cox.jpg)

##### Shanoon Cox

 Mar 27, 2024• Proven solutions

_“Is Dubsmash still good? What are some other dub apps like it that I can use?”_

With the availability of so many **video dubbing apps**, users have become a little confused about their features. These days, a lot of friends ask me about the best dub app that they can use. Ideally, the selection of a preferred dubbing app would depend on your requirements. Some apps have better editing features while others are more social. Therefore, to help you pick [the most appropriate video dubbing app](https://tools.techidaily.com/wondershare/filmora/download/) for your needs, I have decided to come up with this list.

* [Part 1: Top 6 Video Dubbing Mobile Apps](#part1)
* [Part 2: How to Pick Up the Best Dubbing App?](#part2)

## Top 6 Video Dubbing Mobile Apps

While there are tons of video dubbing and social apps out there, I would say the following tried-and-tested options are the best.

#### 1\. [Dubsmash](https://dubsmash.com/)

Dubsmash is often considered as the original dub app as it has been around for years. You can find tons of existing voiceovers and can instantly share your videos with your friends via its social feature.

* There are thousands of voiceovers you can find listed under different categories.
* You can just select any voiceover audio and start lip-syncing it while recording your video.
* Not just to record videos, the app can also be used to watch tons of memes and funny videos.
* There is an inbuilt option to further edit the video like clip it, apply a filter, and so on.

**Pros**

* Free and easy to use
* Has a social community

**Cons**

* Not so secure (witnessed data breach issues in the past)

**Runs on**: iOS and Android

#### 2\. [MadLipz](https://madlipz.com/)

Known for its “instant dubbing and subbing” features, this dub app is already used by millions of people worldwide. The video dubbing app runs on iOS and Android and is available in different languages as well.

* There are tons of ready-made clips and recordings in different categories to pick from.
* Apart from dubbing, you can also include different subtitles in the videos (that are also available in the app).
* You can post your “lipz” on its online community and get more followers.
* Since it is a social video platform, you can follow different creators and share content on other platforms as well.

**Pros**

* Tons of available clips to pick from
* Clear and easy-to-use design

**Cons**

* Limited editing features

**Runs on**: iOS and Android

#### 3\. [Filmora](https://tools.techidaily.com/wondershare/filmora/download/)

If you are looking for a freely available mobile application to edit your videos, then Filmora should be an ideal pick. Apart from being a dub app, you can also use it to edit your videos with its inbuilt features.

* You can find hundreds of sound effects, royalty-free music, and voiceover tracks in the app that you can add to your videos.
* Apart from its existing collection, it also lets us record the voiceover for a video using its inbuilt recording feature.
