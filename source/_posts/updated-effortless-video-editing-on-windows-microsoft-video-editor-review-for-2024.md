To edit and enhance videos in Windows-based PC, Windows Movie Maker has always been touted as the default Microsoft Video Editor, although it has been discontinued by Microsoft on Janauary 10, 2017 and replaced by [Windows Story Remix (only for Windows 8/10)](https://www.howtogeek.com/355524/how-to-use-windows-10s-hidden-video-editor/), you can still download it on many platforms. However, you may often fail to import their video clips because it only supports WMV ASF, .MPG (MPEG-1), .AVI (DV-AVI), .WMA, .WAV, and .MP3\. Plus, the transitions and effects provided are quite limited, nothing fancy. If this is the case, you'll find a great microsoft video editing software here.

[Wondershare Filmora](https://tools.techidaily.com/wondershare/filmora/download/), designed to be easy to use, needs no any educational or professional background in post-production. The self-explanatory options help you easily make movies in minutes to share everywhere! Just pick it up to edit your own videos quickly and see what this Microsoft video editor can do for you.
