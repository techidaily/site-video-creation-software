### What is VVC/H.266 Video Codec?

VVC (Versatile Video Coding) is a brand-new video compression technology that is under positive development to help reduce video size while not sacrifice the quality. Under this standard, the video compression efficiency will increase about 50% that even gains over HEVC of 40 percent. That is to say, a 1GB movie encoded with VVC video codec will be compressed to around 500MB yet the video image and sound quality will stay the same. 

VVC (H.266) video codec is especially designed to aid in the smoothness of higher-quality video services such as 360° omnidirectional immersive multimedia, high-dynamic-range (HDR) video and conventional dynamic range video. As of now, obvious effectiveness of VVC video codec has been shown on ultra-high (UHD) videos. In the near future, it is possible to enable twice as much 360°/HDR video content as now to be stored on a disk and server, or sent through a streaming service like YouTube, Dailymotion and Vevo.
