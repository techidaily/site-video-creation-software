 Use the following Adobe Premiere tips to make your video editing easier and save time and energy. Make the process much easier than you had thought.

## Useful Adobe Premiere Pro and Elements tips

#### 1. Change the default settings

 You can save some time on video editing by changing two default settings: Scale Media to Project Size and Default Picture Length. You can go to Edit > Preferences > General to find the two settings. Scale Media to Project Size means any photo or video will be scaled down to the project size. This setting will save you a lot of time especially when you are mixing a lot of SD and HD video and photos. Default Picture Length originally is set at 150 frames or five seconds of footage. You can change it to any set mount so that you don't need to adjust every photo you import. When you finished the settings changing, hit "OK" to save.

#### 2.Capture video clips from your camcorder directly

 Remember that you don't need to transfer your camcorder videos to your hard drive first and then import the video clips to Adobe Premiere. When you have connected your camcorder or other video capture devices to your computer, set the camcorder to playback or set it in VCR mode. Then, in Adobe Premiere, start a new project and go to File > Capture to import your media from your camcorder directly. This will save your some time for Adobe Premiere video editing.

#### 3. Keep your project more organized with "Bins"

 You can click the "Folder" icon in the "Project" window to create a new folder to store video clips or other things. Store them in many different folders rather than only one so that you can find what you want more quickly. Create bins for storing separate audio, video, photo, etc. This Adobe Premiere tip will definitely makes your project more organized and can save time for editing.

#### 4. Create personalized video transitions

 When adding transition effects to videos, you can make some adjustments to the transition effects to make them more personalized. You can locate the transition effects in the "Effects" tab. And in the "Effect Controls" tab, you adjust the transitions such as changing the duration time, changing the entrance animation, etc.

#### 5. Choose the most suitable output video format

 Take the output video quality to consideration when creating a new project in Adobe Premier. For example, if you just want to share the videos on YouTube, then you don't need to create HD videos because it will take you much more time to upload the videos to Internet if they're HD videos. Besides, the HD videos also need much more storage space. Get the smaller video size with better compression and easily share your videos on Web.

#### 6. Quick render

 In Adobe Premiere, most effects and videos render in real time. To have a full preview of all the effects, you can press "Enter", which will render the project and enables you to preview the overall video effect in the "Monitor" window.

 Tip: Adobe Premiere is a very professional video editor and costs a lot. For a video editing beginner, it's better turn to some easy-to-use yet powerful video editor, say [Wondershare Filmora (originally Wondershare Video Editor)](https://tools.techidaily.com/wondershare/filmora/download/), which can help you burn to DVD directly and share to YouTube in several click. If you don't want to spend any money on video editing, you can also turn to some free video editing software like Windows Movie Maker or iMovie.

#### How to shrink video size with this app?

Identifying large video files on your camera roll won’t take too much time since the app **displays the size of all videos**. Besides compressing videos, the Video Compressor app also lets you shrink photos you store on your iPhone or iPad.

Select a video you want to compress, by simply tapping on it, and then **choose a preset resolution** to which that video clip is going to be compressed. Optionally, you can **change the Bitrate** before tapping on the Compression button.

After the video compression process is over you can organize the shrunk videos effortlessly, however, you **must purchase the Pro version** of the app if you want to have access to all of the tools Video Compressor has to offer.

## Is there any iPhone free video compressor with editor built in?

Editing a video before you share it on social media can help you get rid of unwanted parts and make the colors more vivid. **iMovie** is an excellent choice if you would like to **trim a video or add filters and effects to it and reduce the video size**. What’s more, you can use this iOS-native video editing app to reduce the size of the original video files.

Once you complete all video editing tasks you should exit the app’s **Edit window** by tapping done and then tap on the **Share/Save Video** option. iMovie offers a variety of output video file formats, so you can choose if you want to save your video in **360p, 540p, HD or 4K resolution**. After you pick a preferred output resolution the iMovie is going to add the video to the Photo Library.

## Bonus: How to reduce video size on iPhone & iPad when recording?

All recent iPhone and iPad models support recording in a broad spectrum of video resolutions. If you would like to **decrease the resolution** at which your device captures videos you should head to the **Settings menu** and tap on the Camera option.

![ change video size at shooting on iphone ](https://images.wondershare.com/filmora/article-images/change-video-size-at-shooting-iphone.jpg)

Select **Record Video** from the Camera menu and then choose the new resolution for your videos. The default resolution is set at 1080p at 30fps, but you can easily reduce it to 720p at 30fps if you want to create videos that don’t take too much storage space.

The **Record Slo-Mo option** lets you choose between 720p HD at 120fps or 720p HD at 240 fps which allows you to preserve storage space while recording high-quality slow-motion videos.

**Conclusion**

Videos recorded with iPhones and iPads can be huge in size, and sending them or uploading them to the Internet can be a time-consuming process.
