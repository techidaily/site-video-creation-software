### **1\.** [Wondershare Filmora Video Editor](https://tools.techidaily.com/wondershare/filmora/download/)

Wondershare Filmora is an excellent choice when you need to get started with simple video editing features while also having the possibility to progress. If you're concerned about dark videos, Filmora can comfortably solve the issue. Click on the Import option and choose the file of your liking. Then apply changes from the adjustment settings to make it look worthwhile!

[Try It Free](https://tools.techidaily.com/wondershare/filmora/download/)

For macOS 10.12 or later

Filmora video editor allows you to adjust the brightness with the auto enhance feature in one-click. Whatâ€™s more, it provides the color match feature which allows you to match the color between different clips.

### **2\.** VSDC Free Video Editor

The VSDC Free Footage Editor, in the hands of a skilled user, can generate some truly professional-looking videos. The application supports virtually all major video formats and includes complex video effects such as object transformation and color correction, and also advanced audio effects such as volume adjustment and sound normalization. You have the luxury of brightening your videos simply by uploading the video from your desktop and making whatever changes that you want to make.

VSDC Free Video Editor is actually free, unlike certain "high-end" editors. You may utilize the whole feature set of the application without having to contend with annoying watermarks. Unfortunately, there is one snag. You must pay if you want technical assistance. (And there's a strong possibility you'll have to.) Subscription for the VSDC Free Video Editor is $1 per month, $5 per half-year, and $10 per year.

### **3\.** iMovie

iMovie for Mac allows you to experience your films in new ways. Make Hollywood-style teasers and gorgeous movies in excellent 4K resolution by quickly browsing your footage and instantly sharing your best moments. Color Balance and Color Correction are two options for brightening a movie in iMovie 10.1 or later. The former has four tabs: Auto, Match Color, White Balance, and Skin Tone Balance, which allow you to make automated color adjustments.

The latter has sliders for manually adjusting brightness, contrast, saturation, shadows, and other parameters. Simply choose the clip you want to change and then select the appropriate tool from the toolbar above the viewer. It's not very technical, but it makes it simple to brighten up a gloomy video.

### 4\. **Premiere** Pro CC

Premiere Pro includes a user interface that is both appealing and versatile. The startup feature enables you to rapidly return to previous projects, start new ones, or browse for Adobe Stock video. You can switch between workspaces for Assembly, Editing, Color, Effects, Audio, and Titles, and the dark system window tends to make your videos the focus of attention.

Premiere Pro CC is another desktop video editor that you can use to brighten your videos. The various parameters in the Lumetri Color panel window inside Premiere Pro CC may be used to accomplish video color correction.

Premiere Pro's Lumetri Color Tools elevate the application to the level of Photoshop for video. These tools provide a surprising amount of color modification and a wide range of film and HDR effects. With keyframes, you may modify the white balance, exposure, contrast, highlights, shadows, and black point, among other things. Modifications for Saturation, Vibrance, Faded Film and Sharpen are also accessible.

### 5\. Final Cut Pro

Final Cut Pro comes with a set of robust manual color correction features that can be used to achieve a wide range of color correction and enhancement features. Creating a color correction effect and then modifying the effect's settings in the Color inspector is how you utilize the tools. Any of the following color correction effects may be used to make manual color modifications to the color tint, brightness, and contrast of the entire clip picture.

Color correction capabilities in Final Cut Pro allow you to fine-tune the look of any video in your project, including still photos, by adjusting color balance, shadow levels, mid-tone thresholds, highlight levels, and much more. Saturation, exposure, and color modifications are all controlled via the Color Board. Adjust the Brightness in the color adjustment panels to brighten your movies.

**Conclusion**

Adjusting brightness has become a "small problem" for many. Oftentimes, you record a video, and it falls short of the brightness criteria â€“ it's too dark! However, when you have quality **Video Brightness Editors**, like the ones we have reviewed above, you're in good hands. Not only are these apps easy to use with excellent functionality, but they also make editing a piece of cake for everyone.
