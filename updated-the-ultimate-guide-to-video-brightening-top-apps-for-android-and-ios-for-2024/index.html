It is important to note that if you choose to rotate a video, the results you are going to get maybe underwhelming, to say the least, because the video’s aspect ratio is going to remain the same. The process of rotating a video is rather simple, and you don’t need access to a professional video editing app like Adobe Premiere Pro to perform this task, because there are quite a few online platforms you can use to rotate your videos online.</p>

It is important to note that if you choose to rotate a video, the results you are going to get maybe underwhelming, to say the least, because the video’s aspect ratio is going to remain the same. The process of rotating a video is rather simple, and you don’t need access to a professional video editing app like Adobe Premiere Pro to perform this task, because there are quite a few online platforms you can use to rotate your videos online.</p>

It is important to note that if you choose to rotate a video, the results you are going to get maybe underwhelming, to say the least, because the video’s aspect ratio is going to remain the same. The process of rotating a video is rather simple, and you don’t need access to a professional video editing app like Adobe Premiere Pro to perform this task, because there are quite a few online platforms you can use to rotate your videos online.</p>

<p>Editing 4K videos requires high computer performance, to avoid your computer overrunning, Filmora can <a class="link"   target="_blank" rel="noopener" href="https://tools.techidaily.com/wondershare/filmora/download/" >create proxy files <i class="fa-regular fa-arrow-up-right-from-square fa-sm"></i></a> to load the video in lower resolution during editing, but rending the final export video with the original full quality. You can also customize the playback quality of the 4K videos to half quality or even 1&#x2F;6 quality for smoother editing.</p>

You can also import movies and trailers from iMovie for iPhone and iPad.</p>
<p><img  
                     lazyload
                     src="/images/loading.svg"

                      alt=" iMovie Project Editing Interface"
                ></p>
<p>With iMovie for iOS and macOS, you can enjoy your videos like never before. It’s easy to browse your clips and create Hollywood-style trailers and stunning 4K-resolution movies. You can even start editing on iPhone or iPad, then finish on your Mac. And when you’re ready to premiere your movie on all your devices, iMovie Theater rolls out the red carpet.</p>
<p>It should be noted that 4K video editing requires a Mac from 2011 or later with at least 4GB of RAM. To playback 4K video in full resolution, you’ll need an iMac with Retina display or Mac Pro connected to a 4K display.</p>
<h4 id="3-CyberLink-PowerDirector-Ultra"><a href="#3-CyberLink-PowerDirector-Ultra" class="headerlink" title="3. CyberLink PowerDirector Ultra"></a>3. <a class="link"   target="_blank" rel="noopener" href="http://www.cyberlink.com/products/powerdirector-ultra/features%5Fen%5FAU.html?&r=1" >CyberLink PowerDirector Ultra <i class="fa-regular fa-arrow-up-right-from-square fa-sm"></i></a></h4><p>Video makers who want a very powerful, professional-level video editing program are often shocked by the price tag. However, they find that CyberLink PowerDirector Ultra, with a more beginner-friendly interface and easier to use, has virtually everything just as other programs with a higher price.</p>
<p>![CyberLink PowerDirector Editing Interface](<a class="link"   target="_blank" rel="noopener" href="https://images.wondershare.com/filmora/article-images/cyberlink-powerdirector" >https://images.wondershare.com/filmora/article-images/cyberlink-powerdirector <i class="fa-regular fa-arrow-up-right-from-square fa-sm"></i></a> -ultra-19 interface.png)</p>
<p>It’s hard to look past PowerDirector Ultra if you need 4k support, and if you don’t want to sacrifice on advanced features that allow you to create professional-looking videos, even if you are a beginner or have minimal experience with video editing.</p>
<p>This latest edition of PowerDirector supports 64-bit processors for faster editing, and of course, new support for 4K resolution videos. At under $100, CyberLink PowerDirector 19 Ultra comes amazingly close to being as advanced and capable as software that is priced multiple times more than it; making it an ideal choice for the budget-conscious video editing enthusiast.</p>
<h4 id="4-Vegas-Pro"><a href="#4-Vegas-Pro" class="headerlink" title="4. Vegas Pro"></a>4. <a class="link"   target="_blank" rel="noopener" href="http://www.sonycreativesoftware.com/vegaspro" >Vegas Pro <i class="fa-regular fa-arrow-up-right-from-square fa-sm"></i></a></h4><p>One of the higher end video editing software options is the highly renowned non-linear editor (NLE) Magix Vegas Pro. Now up to version 18, this software is used by professionals and amateurs alike. Vegas Pro 18 comes with native support for 4K video, with maximum frame sizes of up to 4096 x 4096. There is native support for XAVC and XAVC S files, plus files from Red Epic and Red One. There are a number of extras and plugins included in Vegas Pro, including DVD Architect Pro.</p>
<p><img

                      alt="Vegas Pro Editing Interface"
                ></p>
<p>Complete support for 4K editing puts Vegas Pro at the forefront of software in this genre, while you can also edit SD, HD, 2K and 3D videos, using Sony’s intuitive drag and drop interface. There are a huge number of tools and effects available, allowing complete control, creativity, and flexibility within the editing environment which is easily accessible to those who may even be brand new to editing videos in an NLE application.</p>
<p>The software is available at a cost of $399(on sale)&#x2F; $599.99(regularly); and the price is the same whether you select a download version, or the physical packaged version.</p>
<h4 id="5-Vegas-Movie-Studio"><a href="#5-Vegas-Movie-Studio" class="headerlink" title="5. Vegas Movie Studio"></a>5. <a class="link"   target="_blank" rel="noopener" href="http://www.sonycreativesoftware.com/moviestudiope?cpint=EURO_S3_MOVIE_AX100" >Vegas Movie Studio <i class="fa-regular fa-arrow-up-right-from-square fa-sm"></i></a></h4><p>At only $39.99, Studio 17 Platinum is just a fraction of the cost of Sony’s fully fledged editor, Vegas Pro. Magix Movie Studio 17 Platinum is a basic video editing application, suited for the beginner and home user. With an emphasis on giving users the ability to easily create and share their videos on social media sites, or creating your own home DVDs, the workflow and interface has been designed to be as simple and intuitive as possible to use, without the extensive and more complex abilities of a high end application like Sony Vegas Pro.</p>
<p>Notable features include a simple way of selecting the best output format with the Make Movie dialog, the choice of using the Simple Edit Mode or Advanced Edit Mode, fast direct upload to YouTube 4K, Color Match plug-in, and lots more.</p>
<h4 id="6-Adobe-Premiere-Pro"><a href="#6-Adobe-Premiere-Pro" class="headerlink" title="6.

As with most of Adobe’s software, Premiere Pro is now part of the Creative Cloud plan. This requires subscription to use the application via Adobe’s cloud service.</p>
<p>The sheer number of features within Premiere Pro CC is extensive. But the latest version has been designed to provide a faster workflow during editing, which will be appreciated by both new and seasoned users alike. New features that are worth noting in the CC version include live text templates, which integrates seamlessly with After Effects, native support for a range of new formats, automatic backing up to the Cloud, improvements to masking and tracking, and the ability to export in new industry standard formats.</p>
<p>The minimum cost to access a CC plan that includes Premiere Pro is $20.99 per month. However many users will likely be inclined to select the $52.99 per month plan which includes Premiere Pro and After Effects, as well as Photoshop and more.</p>
<h4 id="7-Apple-Final-Cut-Pro-X"><a href="#7-Apple-Final-Cut-Pro-X" class="headerlink" title="7.

Used extensively in the professional movie industry, as well as amongst amateurs, the latest version comes with full support for full resolution 4K ProRes in multiple streams (which is made for working particularly fast on the new Mac Pro).</p>
<p>There are hundreds of features worthy of listing, however some of the most important and interesting ones include the Magnetic Timeline which has been designed to avoid sync problems or small unwanted gaps when editing, easy organization of media with keywords and metadata, multicam clip editing, multi channel audio editing.</p>
<h4 id="8-MAGIX-Movie-Edit-Pro-2021"><a href="#8-MAGIX-Movie-Edit-Pro-2021" class="headerlink" title="8.

This application is available in three versions: deluxe, Plus and Premium, with the Premium version containing the most features and capabilities.</p>
<p>The inbuilt automatic wizards in the basic version of Movie Edit Pro make it easy for those with little or no experience in what can be the daunting process of editing videos. The software includes more than 1500 effects and templates, editing on up to 99 tracks (in the Plus and Premium versions). There is also support for multicam editing, and the ability to easily export your finished product to a range of media and social video websites.</p>

For example, if you are using Filmora to handle 4K video footage, you can create a proxy smaller file, as well as preview it on a lower resolution to improve the editing efficiency. Filmora has pre-programmed many transitions, effects, filters and elements, which can help you make the video better and faster.</p>
<h4 id="2-Is-there-any-free-4k-video-editor"><a href="#2-Is-there-any-free-4k-video-editor" class="headerlink" title="2.  Is there any free 4k video editor?"></a>2.  Is there any free 4k video editor?</h4><p>If you are running Windows10, you will find that the inbuilt Photos app only allows you to export from 540p, 720p, and 1080p, no 4K.</p>
<p>For Mac users, the good news is that you can work with 4k and 60 frames per second in the free inbuilt video editor iMovie.</p>

You can also customize the playback quality of the 4K videos to half quality or even 1&#x2F;6 quality for smoother editing.</p>

You can also import movies and trailers from iMovie for iPhone and iPad.</p>
<p><img

                ></p>
<p>With iMovie for iOS and macOS, you can enjoy your videos like never before. It’s easy to browse your clips and create Hollywood-style trailers and stunning 4K-resolution movies. You can even start editing on iPhone or iPad, then finish on your Mac. And when you’re ready to premiere your movie on all your devices, iMovie Theater rolls out the red carpet.</p>
<p>It should be noted that 4K video editing requires a Mac from 2011 or later with at least 4GB of RAM. To playback 4K video in full resolution, you’ll need an iMac with Retina display or Mac Pro connected to a 4K display.</p>
<h4 id="3-CyberLink-PowerDirector-Ultra-1"><a href="#3-CyberLink-PowerDirector-Ultra-1" class="headerlink" title="3. CyberLink PowerDirector Ultra"></a>3. <a class="link"   target="_blank" rel="noopener" href="http://www.cyberlink.com/products/powerdirector-ultra/features%5Fen%5FAU.html?&r=1" >CyberLink PowerDirector Ultra <i class="fa-regular fa-arrow-up-right-from-square fa-sm"></i></a></h4><p>Video makers who want a very powerful, professional-level video editing program are often shocked by the price tag. However, they find that CyberLink PowerDirector Ultra, with a more beginner-friendly interface and easier to use, has virtually everything just as other programs with a higher price.</p>
<p>![CyberLink PowerDirector Editing Interface](<a class="link"   target="_blank" rel="noopener" href="https://images.wondershare.com/filmora/article-images/cyberlink-powerdirector" >https://images.wondershare.com/filmora/article-images/cyberlink-powerdirector <i class="fa-regular fa-arrow-up-right-from-square fa-sm"></i></a> -ultra-19 interface.png)</p>
<p>It’s hard to look past PowerDirector Ultra if you need 4k support, and if you don’t want to sacrifice on advanced features that allow you to create professional-looking videos, even if you are a beginner or have minimal experience with video editing.</p>
<p>This latest edition of PowerDirector supports 64-bit processors for faster editing, and of course, new support for 4K resolution videos. At under $100, CyberLink PowerDirector 19 Ultra comes amazingly close to being as advanced and capable as software that is priced multiple times more than it; making it an ideal choice for the budget-conscious video editing enthusiast.</p>
<h4 id="4-Vegas-Pro-1"><a href="#4-Vegas-Pro-1" class="headerlink" title="4. Vegas Pro"></a>4. <a class="link"   target="_blank" rel="noopener" href="http://www.sonycreativesoftware.com/vegaspro" >Vegas Pro <i class="fa-regular fa-arrow-up-right-from-square fa-sm"></i></a></h4><p>One of the higher end video editing software options is the highly renowned non-linear editor (NLE) Magix Vegas Pro. Now up to version 18, this software is used by professionals and amateurs alike. Vegas Pro 18 comes with native support for 4K video, with maximum frame sizes of up to 4096 x 4096. There is native support for XAVC and XAVC S files, plus files from Red Epic and Red One. There are a number of extras and plugins included in Vegas Pro, including DVD Architect Pro.</p>

                      alt="Vegas Pro Editing Interface"
                ></p>
<p>Complete support for 4K editing puts Vegas Pro at the forefront of software in this genre, while you can also edit SD, HD, 2K and 3D videos, using Sony’s intuitive drag and drop interface. There are a huge number of tools and effects available, allowing complete control, creativity, and flexibility within the editing environment which is easily accessible to those who may even be brand new to editing videos in an NLE application.</p>
<p>The software is available at a cost of $399(on sale)&#x2F; $599.99(regularly); and the price is the same whether you select a download version, or the physical packaged version.</p>
<h4 id="5-Vegas-Movie-Studio-1"><a href="#5-Vegas-Movie-Studio-1" class="headerlink" title="5. Vegas Movie Studio"></a>5. <a class="link"   target="_blank" rel="noopener" href="http://www.sonycreativesoftware.com/moviestudiope?cpint=EURO_S3_MOVIE_AX100" >Vegas Movie Studio <i class="fa-regular fa-arrow-up-right-from-square fa-sm"></i></a></h4><p>At only $39.99, Studio 17 Platinum is just a fraction of the cost of Sony’s fully fledged editor, Vegas Pro. Magix Movie Studio 17 Platinum is a basic video editing application, suited for the beginner and home user. With an emphasis on giving users the ability to easily create and share their videos on social media sites, or creating your own home DVDs, the workflow and interface has been designed to be as simple and intuitive as possible to use, without the extensive and more complex abilities of a high end application like Sony Vegas Pro.</p>
<p>Notable features include a simple way of selecting the best output format with the Make Movie dialog, the choice of using the Simple Edit Mode or Advanced Edit Mode, fast direct upload to YouTube 4K, Color Match plug-in, and lots more.</p>
<h4 id="6-Adobe-Premiere-Pro-1"><a href="#6-Adobe-Premiere-Pro-1" class="headerlink" title="6.

As with most of Adobe’s software, Premiere Pro is now part of the Creative Cloud plan. This requires subscription to use the application via Adobe’s cloud service.</p>
<p>The sheer number of features within Premiere Pro CC is extensive. But the latest version has been designed to provide a faster workflow during editing, which will be appreciated by both new and seasoned users alike. New features that are worth noting in the CC version include live text templates, which integrates seamlessly with After Effects, native support for a range of new formats, automatic backing up to the Cloud, improvements to masking and tracking, and the ability to export in new industry standard formats.</p>
<p>The minimum cost to access a CC plan that includes Premiere Pro is $20.99 per month. However many users will likely be inclined to select the $52.99 per month plan which includes Premiere Pro and After Effects, as well as Photoshop and more.</p>
<h4 id="7-Apple-Final-Cut-Pro-X-1"><a href="#7-Apple-Final-Cut-Pro-X-1" class="headerlink" title="7.

Used extensively in the professional movie industry, as well as amongst amateurs, the latest version comes with full support for full resolution 4K ProRes in multiple streams (which is made for working particularly fast on the new Mac Pro).</p>
<p>There are hundreds of features worthy of listing, however some of the most important and interesting ones include the Magnetic Timeline which has been designed to avoid sync problems or small unwanted gaps when editing, easy organization of media with keywords and metadata, multicam clip editing, multi channel audio editing.</p>
<h4 id="8-MAGIX-Movie-Edit-Pro-2021-1"><a href="#8-MAGIX-Movie-Edit-Pro-2021-1" class="headerlink" title="8.

This application is available in three versions: deluxe, Plus and Premium, with the Premium version containing the most features and capabilities.</p>
<p>The inbuilt automatic wizards in the basic version of Movie Edit Pro make it easy for those with little or no experience in what can be the daunting process of editing videos. The software includes more than 1500 effects and templates, editing on up to 99 tracks (in the Plus and Premium versions). There is also support for multicam editing, and the ability to easily export your finished product to a range of media and social video websites.</p>

For example, if you are using Filmora to handle 4K video footage, you can create a proxy smaller file, as well as preview it on a lower resolution to improve the editing efficiency. Filmora has pre-programmed many transitions, effects, filters and elements, which can help you make the video better and faster.</p>

<p>For Mac users, the good news is that you can work with 4k and 60 frames per second in the free inbuilt video editor iMovie.</p>

You can also import movies and trailers from iMovie for iPhone and iPad.</p>
<p><img  
                     lazyload
                     src="/images/loading.svg"

                      alt=" iMovie Project Editing Interface"
                ></p>
<p>With iMovie for iOS and macOS, you can enjoy your videos like never before. It’s easy to browse your clips and create Hollywood-style trailers and stunning 4K-resolution movies. You can even start editing on iPhone or iPad, then finish on your Mac. And when you’re ready to premiere your movie on all your devices, iMovie Theater rolls out the red carpet.</p>
<p>It should be noted that 4K video editing requires a Mac from 2011 or later with at least 4GB of RAM. To playback 4K video in full resolution, you’ll need an iMac with Retina display or Mac Pro connected to a 4K display.</p>
<h4 id="3-CyberLink-PowerDirector-Ultra-2"><a href="#3-CyberLink-PowerDirector-Ultra-2" class="headerlink" title="3. CyberLink PowerDirector Ultra"></a>3. <a class="link"   target="_blank" rel="noopener" href="http://www.cyberlink.com/products/powerdirector-ultra/features%5Fen%5FAU.html?&r=1" >CyberLink PowerDirector Ultra <i class="fa-regular fa-arrow-up-right-from-square fa-sm"></i></a></h4><p>Video makers who want a very powerful, professional-level video editing program are often shocked by the price tag. However, they find that CyberLink PowerDirector Ultra, with a more beginner-friendly interface and easier to use, has virtually everything just as other programs with a higher price.</p>
<p>![CyberLink PowerDirector Editing Interface](<a class="link"   target="_blank" rel="noopener" href="https://images.wondershare.com/filmora/article-images/cyberlink-powerdirector" >https://images.wondershare.com/filmora/article-images/cyberlink-powerdirector <i class="fa-regular fa-arrow-up-right-from-square fa-sm"></i></a> -ultra-19 interface.png)</p>
<p>It’s hard to look past PowerDirector Ultra if you need 4k support, and if you don’t want to sacrifice on advanced features that allow you to create professional-looking videos, even if you are a beginner or have minimal experience with video editing.</p>
<p>This latest edition of PowerDirector supports 64-bit processors for faster editing, and of course, new support for 4K resolution videos. At under $100, CyberLink PowerDirector 19 Ultra comes amazingly close to being as advanced and capable as software that is priced multiple times more than it; making it an ideal choice for the budget-conscious video editing enthusiast.</p>
<h4 id="4-Vegas-Pro-2"><a href="#4-Vegas-Pro-2" class="headerlink" title="4. Vegas Pro"></a>4. <a class="link"   target="_blank" rel="noopener" href="http://www.sonycreativesoftware.com/vegaspro" >Vegas Pro <i class="fa-regular fa-arrow-up-right-from-square fa-sm"></i></a></h4><p>One of the higher end video editing software options is the highly renowned non-linear editor (NLE) Magix Vegas Pro. Now up to version 18, this software is used by professionals and amateurs alike. Vegas Pro 18 comes with native support for 4K video, with maximum frame sizes of up to 4096 x 4096. There is native support for XAVC and XAVC S files, plus files from Red Epic and Red One. There are a number of extras and plugins included in Vegas Pro, including DVD Architect Pro.</p>
<p><img

                      alt="Vegas Pro Editing Interface"
                ></p>
<p>Complete support for 4K editing puts Vegas Pro at the forefront of software in this genre, while you can also edit SD, HD, 2K and 3D videos, using Sony’s intuitive drag and drop interface. There are a huge number of tools and effects available, allowing complete control, creativity, and flexibility within the editing environment which is easily accessible to those who may even be brand new to editing videos in an NLE application.</p>
<p>The software is available at a cost of $399(on sale)&#x2F; $599.99(regularly); and the price is the same whether you select a download version, or the physical packaged version.</p>
<h4 id="5-Vegas-Movie-Studio-2"><a href="#5-Vegas-Movie-Studio-2" class="headerlink" title="5. Vegas Movie Studio"></a>5. <a class="link"   target="_blank" rel="noopener" href="http://www.sonycreativesoftware.com/moviestudiope?cpint=EURO_S3_MOVIE_AX100" >Vegas Movie Studio <i class="fa-regular fa-arrow-up-right-from-square fa-sm"></i></a></h4><p>At only $39.99, Studio 17 Platinum is just a fraction of the cost of Sony’s fully fledged editor, Vegas Pro. Magix Movie Studio 17 Platinum is a basic video editing application, suited for the beginner and home user. With an emphasis on giving users the ability to easily create and share their videos on social media sites, or creating your own home DVDs, the workflow and interface has been designed to be as simple and intuitive as possible to use, without the extensive and more complex abilities of a high end application like Sony Vegas Pro.</p>
<p>Notable features include a simple way of selecting the best output format with the Make Movie dialog, the choice of using the Simple Edit Mode or Advanced Edit Mode, fast direct upload to YouTube 4K, Color Match plug-in, and lots more.</p>
<h4 id="6-Adobe-Premiere-Pro-2"><a href="#6-Adobe-Premiere-Pro-2" class="headerlink" title="6.

As with most of Adobe’s software, Premiere Pro is now part of the Creative Cloud plan. This requires subscription to use the application via Adobe’s cloud service.</p>
<p>The sheer number of features within Premiere Pro CC is extensive. But the latest version has been designed to provide a faster workflow during editing, which will be appreciated by both new and seasoned users alike. New features that are worth noting in the CC version include live text templates, which integrates seamlessly with After Effects, native support for a range of new formats, automatic backing up to the Cloud, improvements to masking and tracking, and the ability to export in new industry standard formats.</p>
<p>The minimum cost to access a CC plan that includes Premiere Pro is $20.99 per month. However many users will likely be inclined to select the $52.99 per month plan which includes Premiere Pro and After Effects, as well as Photoshop and more.</p>
<h4 id="7-Apple-Final-Cut-Pro-X-2"><a href="#7-Apple-Final-Cut-Pro-X-2" class="headerlink" title="7.

Used extensively in the professional movie industry, as well as amongst amateurs, the latest version comes with full support for full resolution 4K ProRes in multiple streams (which is made for working particularly fast on the new Mac Pro).</p>
<p>There are hundreds of features worthy of listing, however some of the most important and interesting ones include the Magnetic Timeline which has been designed to avoid sync problems or small unwanted gaps when editing, easy organization of media with keywords and metadata, multicam clip editing, multi channel audio editing.</p>
<h4 id="8-MAGIX-Movie-Edit-Pro-2021-2"><a href="#8-MAGIX-Movie-Edit-Pro-2021-2" class="headerlink" title="8.

This application is available in three versions: deluxe, Plus and Premium, with the Premium version containing the most features and capabilities.</p>
<p>The inbuilt automatic wizards in the basic version of Movie Edit Pro make it easy for those with little or no experience in what can be the daunting process of editing videos. The software includes more than 1500 effects and templates, editing on up to 99 tracks (in the Plus and Premium versions). There is also support for multicam editing, and the ability to easily export your finished product to a range of media and social video websites.</p>

For example, if you are using Filmora to handle 4K video footage, you can create a proxy smaller file, as well as preview it on a lower resolution to improve the editing efficiency. Filmora has pre-programmed many transitions, effects, filters and elements, which can help you make the video better and faster.</p>
<h4 id="2-Is-there-any-free-4k-video-editor-2"><a href="#2-Is-there-any-free-4k-video-editor-2" class="headerlink" title="2.  Is there any free 4k video editor?"></a>2.

<p>For Mac users, the good news is that you can work with 4k and 60 frames per second in the free inbuilt video editor iMovie.</p>

You can also import movies and trailers from iMovie for iPhone and iPad.</p>
<p><img  
                     lazyload
                     src="/images/loading.svg"
                     data-src="https://images.wondershare.com/filmora/article-images/imovie-project-editing-ineterface.jpg"
                      alt=" iMovie Project Editing Interface"
                ></p>
<p>With iMovie for iOS and macOS, you can enjoy your videos like never before. It’s easy to browse your clips and create Hollywood-style trailers and stunning 4K-resolution movies. You can even start editing on iPhone or iPad, then finish on your Mac. And when you’re ready to premiere your movie on all your devices, iMovie Theater rolls out the red carpet.</p>
<p>It should be noted that 4K video editing requires a Mac from 2011 or later with at least 4GB of RAM. To playback 4K video in full resolution, you’ll need an iMac with Retina display or Mac Pro connected to a 4K display.</p>
<h4 id="3-CyberLink-PowerDirector-Ultra-3"><a href="#3-CyberLink-PowerDirector-Ultra-3" class="headerlink" title="3. CyberLink PowerDirector Ultra"></a>3. <a class="link"   target="_blank" rel="noopener" href="http://www.cyberlink.com/products/powerdirector-ultra/features%5Fen%5FAU.html?&r=1" >CyberLink PowerDirector Ultra <i class="fa-regular fa-arrow-up-right-from-square fa-sm"></i></a></h4><p>Video makers who want a very powerful, professional-level video editing program are often shocked by the price tag. However, they find that CyberLink PowerDirector Ultra, with a more beginner-friendly interface and easier to use, has virtually everything just as other programs with a higher price.</p>
<p>![CyberLink PowerDirector Editing Interface](<a class="link"   target="_blank" rel="noopener" href="https://images.wondershare.com/filmora/article-images/cyberlink-powerdirector" >https://images.wondershare.com/filmora/article-images/cyberlink-powerdirector <i class="fa-regular fa-arrow-up-right-from-square fa-sm"></i></a> -ultra-19 interface.png)</p>
<p>It’s hard to look past PowerDirector Ultra if you need 4k support, and if you don’t want to sacrifice on advanced features that allow you to create professional-looking videos, even if you are a beginner or have minimal experience with video editing.</p>
<p>This latest edition of PowerDirector supports 64-bit processors for faster editing, and of course, new support for 4K resolution videos. At under $100, CyberLink PowerDirector 19 Ultra comes amazingly close to being as advanced and capable as software that is priced multiple times more than it; making it an ideal choice for the budget-conscious video editing enthusiast.</p>
<h4 id="4-Vegas-Pro-3"><a href="#4-Vegas-Pro-3" class="headerlink" title="4. Vegas Pro"></a>4. <a class="link"   target="_blank" rel="noopener" href="http://www.sonycreativesoftware.com/vegaspro" >Vegas Pro <i class="fa-regular fa-arrow-up-right-from-square fa-sm"></i></a></h4><p>One of the higher end video editing software options is the highly renowned non-linear editor (NLE) Magix Vegas Pro. Now up to version 18, this software is used by professionals and amateurs alike. Vegas Pro 18 comes with native support for 4K video, with maximum frame sizes of up to 4096 x 4096. There is native support for XAVC and XAVC S files, plus files from Red Epic and Red One. There are a number of extras and plugins included in Vegas Pro, including DVD Architect Pro.</p>
<p><img  
                     lazyload
                     src="/images/loading.svg"

                      alt="Vegas Pro Editing Interface"
                ></p>
<p>Complete support for 4K editing puts Vegas Pro at the forefront of software in this genre, while you can also edit SD, HD, 2K and 3D videos, using Sony’s intuitive drag and drop interface. There are a huge number of tools and effects available, allowing complete control, creativity, and flexibility within the editing environment which is easily accessible to those who may even be brand new to editing videos in an NLE application.</p>
<p>The software is available at a cost of $399(on sale)&#x2F; $599.99(regularly); and the price is the same whether you select a download version, or the physical packaged version.</p>
<h4 id="5-Vegas-Movie-Studio-3"><a href="#5-Vegas-Movie-Studio-3" class="headerlink" title="5. Vegas Movie Studio"></a>5. <a class="link"   target="_blank" rel="noopener" href="http://www.sonycreativesoftware.com/moviestudiope?cpint=EURO_S3_MOVIE_AX100" >Vegas Movie Studio <i class="fa-regular fa-arrow-up-right-from-square fa-sm"></i></a></h4><p>At only $39.99, Studio 17 Platinum is just a fraction of the cost of Sony’s fully fledged editor, Vegas Pro. Magix Movie Studio 17 Platinum is a basic video editing application, suited for the beginner and home user. With an emphasis on giving users the ability to easily create and share their videos on social media sites, or creating your own home DVDs, the workflow and interface has been designed to be as simple and intuitive as possible to use, without the extensive and more complex abilities of a high end application like Sony Vegas Pro.</p>
<p>Notable features include a simple way of selecting the best output format with the Make Movie dialog, the choice of using the Simple Edit Mode or Advanced Edit Mode, fast direct upload to YouTube 4K, Color Match plug-in, and lots more.</p>
<h4 id="6-Adobe-Premiere-Pro-3"><a href="#6-Adobe-Premiere-Pro-3" class="headerlink" title="6. Adobe Premiere Pro"></a>6. <a class="link"   target="_blank" rel="noopener" href="https://www.adobe.com/products/premiere.html" >Adobe Premiere Pro <i class="fa-regular fa-arrow-up-right-from-square fa-sm"></i></a></h4><p>Another video editing application that is considered to be at the highest end is Adobe’s Premier Pro. As with most of Adobe’s software, Premiere Pro is now part of the Creative Cloud plan. This requires subscription to use the application via Adobe’s cloud service.</p>
<p>The sheer number of features within Premiere Pro CC is extensive. But the latest version has been designed to provide a faster workflow during editing, which will be appreciated by both new and seasoned users alike. New features that are worth noting in the CC version include live text templates, which integrates seamlessly with After Effects, native support for a range of new formats, automatic backing up to the Cloud, improvements to masking and tracking, and the ability to export in new industry standard formats.</p>
<p>The minimum cost to access a CC plan that includes Premiere Pro is $20.99 per month. However many users will likely be inclined to select the $52.99 per month plan which includes Premiere Pro and After Effects, as well as Photoshop and more.</p>
<h4 id="7-Apple-Final-Cut-Pro-X-3"><a href="#7-Apple-Final-Cut-Pro-X-3" class="headerlink" title="7. Apple Final Cut Pro X"></a>7. <a class="link"   target="_blank" rel="noopener" href="https://www.apple.com/au/final-cut-pro/" >Apple Final Cut Pro X <i class="fa-regular fa-arrow-up-right-from-square fa-sm"></i></a></h4><p>The professional level video editing application for Mac is the very well known Apple Final Cut Pro X. Used extensively in the professional movie industry, as well as amongst amateurs, the latest version comes with full support for full resolution 4K ProRes in multiple streams (which is made for working particularly fast on the new Mac Pro).</p>
<p>There are hundreds of features worthy of listing, however some of the most important and interesting ones include the Magnetic Timeline which has been designed to avoid sync problems or small unwanted gaps when editing, easy organization of media with keywords and metadata, multicam clip editing, multi channel audio editing.</p>
<h4 id="8-MAGIX-Movie-Edit-Pro-2021-3"><a href="#8-MAGIX-Movie-Edit-Pro-2021-3" class="headerlink" title="8. MAGIX Movie Edit Pro 2021"></a>8. <a class="link"   target="_blank" rel="noopener" href="http://www.magix.com/au/movie-edit-pro/" >MAGIX Movie Edit Pro 2021 <i class="fa-regular fa-arrow-up-right-from-square fa-sm"></i></a></h4><p>Movie Edit Pro 2021 is another affordable video editing solution for home and amateur users that now has full support for 4K videos. This application is available in three versions: deluxe, Plus and Premium, with the Premium version containing the most features and capabilities.</p>
<p>The inbuilt automatic wizards in the basic version of Movie Edit Pro make it easy for those with little or no experience in what can be the daunting process of editing videos. The software includes more than 1500 effects and templates, editing on up to 99 tracks (in the Plus and Premium versions). There is also support for multicam editing, and the ability to easily export your finished product to a range of media and social video websites.</p>

What is the best 4k video editor for Windows PC?"></a>1.  What is the best 4k video editor for Windows PC?</h4><p>Each video editor listed above has its advantages over others. For example, if you are using Filmora to handle 4K video footage, you can create a proxy smaller file, as well as preview it on a lower resolution to improve the editing efficiency. Filmora has pre-programmed many transitions, effects, filters and elements, which can help you make the video better and faster.</p>
<h4 id="2-Is-there-any-free-4k-video-editor-3"><a href="#2-Is-there-any-free-4k-video-editor-3" class="headerlink" title="2.  Is there any free 4k video editor?"></a>2.  Is there any free 4k video editor?</h4><p>If you are running Windows10, you will find that the inbuilt Photos app only allows you to export from 540p, 720p, and 1080p, no 4K.</p>
<p>For Mac users, the good news is that you can work with 4k and 60 frames per second in the free inbuilt video editor iMovie.</p>
<p>And if there are some other video editing software which is missed from the list, please leave a comment and let us know. But before you leave, do not forget to download and try our latest video editing software Filmora to edit your 4K video footage.</p>
