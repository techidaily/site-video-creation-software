                ></p>
<p><strong>Step 4:</strong> Then press the <strong>Done</strong> button. This is how you can use the Windows Photos App and add a soundtrack from its background music library to videos. Windows 10 has several benefits, and with the correct tools, you can get the most out of it.</p>
<h3 id="2-Apple-iMovie-3"><a href="#2-Apple-iMovie-3" class="headerlink" title="2  Apple iMovie"></a>2  Apple iMovie</h3><p><strong>Supported System</strong>: macOS, iOS</p>
<p><strong>Pricing:</strong> Free</p>
<p>Apple’s entry-level desktop video editing software can transform your video and photographs into professional-looking creations. However, <a class="link"   target="_blank" rel="noopener" href="https://tools.techidaily.com/wondershare/filmora/download/" >Apple’s video editing software <i class="fa-regular fa-arrow-up-right-from-square fa-sm"></i></a> hasn’t evolved much in the last several years.</p>
<p>Nevertheless, it still outperforms what you will get with Windows 10, which would be limited to the (albeit increasing) video capabilities integrated within Windows’ Photos app.</p>
<p>In your digital films, Apple iMovie contains superb capabilities for media management, color grading, speed, green-screen effects, narration, and music.</p>
<p>It isn’t always the first to support new formats—<a class="link"   target="_blank" rel="noopener" href="https://tools.techidaily.com/wondershare/filmora/download/" >360-degree video <i class="fa-regular fa-arrow-up-right-from-square fa-sm"></i></a> is currently unavailable, but it supports 4K. <a class="link"   target="_blank" rel="noopener" href="https://tools.techidaily.com/wondershare/filmora/download/" >Trailers <i class="fa-regular fa-arrow-up-right-from-square fa-sm"></i></a> and Movies are two of the greatest storyboard-based movie-making features for beginners in iMovie.</p>
<p>For beginner-level video editing, Apple iMovie is an excellent choice. For background sound, the iMovie creator integrates with iTunes and GarageBand, and you may choose from a good range of background soundtracks and audio effects, such as four pitch levels, cosmic, and robot.</p>
<p>The Reduce Background Noise option, on the other hand, is controlled by a slider. Follow these steps to add music to your videos using iMovie:</p>
<p><strong>Step 1:</strong> Click the <strong>Add Media</strong> button while your application is visible in the timeline.</p>
<p><strong>Step 2:</strong> To access the built-in music, go to <strong>Audio</strong>, then <strong>Soundtracks</strong>.</p>
<p><strong>Step 3:</strong> To hear a sample of a soundtrack, press it. If a soundtrack is muted, press it to download it first, then tap it again to listen to it.</p>
<p><strong>Step 4:</strong> Tap the <strong>Add Audio</strong> button near a soundtrack to include it in your composition. iMovie sets the music at the start of the project and instantly adjusts it to the project’s duration.</p>
