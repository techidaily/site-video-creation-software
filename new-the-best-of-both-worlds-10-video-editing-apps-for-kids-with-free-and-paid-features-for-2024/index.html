<h2 id="Getting-Started"><a href="#Getting-Started" class="headerlink" title="Getting Started"></a>Getting Started</h2><p>First, the best thing you can do to improve the quality of your keys is to improve how you shoot them. Here are seven basic production rules:</p>
<ul>
<li>Actors should be at least 10 feet in front of the green screen. This avoids light from the background “spilling” around their body or shoulders.</li>
<li>In general, don’t cast shadows on the green screen. Be very careful shooting feet.</li>
<li>The green background should be as smooth as possible. Paint is always better than fabric; avoid wrinkles and folds.</li>
<li>The green background should be lit smoothly, both from side to side and top to bottom. I try to have the green background display between 40-50% level on the waveform monitor.</li>
<li>There is NO relationship between how the background is lit and how your actors are lit. This article will illustrate that.</li>
<li>Light your background for smoothness. Light your actors for drama.</li>
<li>Don’t worry about having the green background fill the frame. It only needs to completely surround the edges of your actors. Garbage mattes are used to get rid of junk around the edges.</li>
</ul>
<h2 id="Setting-up-the-Key"><a href="#Setting-up-the-Key" class="headerlink" title="Setting up the Key"></a>Setting up the Key</h2><p><img  
                     lazyload
                     src="/images/loading.svg"
                     data-src="https://images.wondershare.com/multimedia/fx-chroma-01.jpg"
                      alt="fx chroma 01"
                ></p>
<p>The green screen image is always placed above the background. You can place either the green screen or background image into the Primary Storyline. I find it easier to put the background in the Primary Storyline, because it makes editing the green screen image easier. But this is purely personal choice.</p>
<p><strong>Step 1: Select the green screen clip</strong></p>
<p>From the <strong>Effects Browser &gt; Keying</strong> category, double-click the <strong>Keyer</strong> effect, which applies it to the selected clip. (You can also drag the effect on top of the clip, if you forgot to select the green-screen clip first.)</p>
<p><img  
                     lazyload
                     src="/images/loading.svg"
                     data-src="https://images.wondershare.com/multimedia/fx-chroma-02.jpg"
                      alt="fx chroma 02"
                ></p>
<p>Don’t panic if your image looks weird – we will fix it.</p>
<p><img  
                     lazyload
                     src="/images/loading.svg"
                     data-src="https://images.wondershare.com/multimedia/fx-chroma-03.jpg"
                      alt="fx chroma 03"
                ></p>
<p>Click the <strong>Sample Color</strong> icon. This allows fine-tuning the selection of the background color.</p>
<p><img  
                     lazyload
                     src="/images/loading.svg"
                     data-src="https://images.wondershare.com/multimedia/fx-chroma-04.jpg"
                      alt="fx chroma 04"
                ></p>
<p>In the green-screen image, drag to select a representative section of the background. I try to get close to the face, but not so close that I accidentally select loose hair or skin.</p>
<p>Your key should look better immediately. Most of the time, you can probably stop here. But there are three other adjustments that can make your key look even better:</p>
<ul>
<li>Cleaning up the matte</li>
<li>Edge adjustments</li>
<li>Light wrap</li>
</ul>
<p><img  
                     lazyload
                     src="/images/loading.svg"
                     data-src="https://images.wondershare.com/multimedia/fx-chroma-06.jpg"
                      alt="fx chroma 06"
                ></p>
<p>Click the <strong>Matte</strong> button to display your key as a white foreground on a black background.</p>
<p><img  
                     lazyload
                     src="/images/loading.svg"
                     data-src="https://images.wondershare.com/multimedia/fx-chroma-07.jpg"
                      alt="fx chroma 07"
                ></p>
<p>Your goal is the make the foreground solid white, which means opaque, and the background solid black, which means transparent. Adjust the <strong>Fill Holes</strong> and <strong>Edge Distance</strong> sliders until your key looks solid. (For REALLY bad keys, you’ll need to also adjust Color Selection, mentioned below.)</p>
<p><img  
                     lazyload
                     src="/images/loading.svg"
                     data-src="https://images.wondershare.com/multimedia/fx-chroma-05.jpg"
                      alt="fx chroma 05"
                ></p>
<p>If an edge is too pronounced, or needs help, click the <strong>Edges</strong> icon.</p>
<p><img  
                     lazyload
                     src="/images/loading.svg"
                     data-src="https://images.wondershare.com/multimedia/fx-chroma-09.jpg"
                      alt="fx chroma 09"
                ></p>
<p><strong>Step 2: Tweaks Video</strong></p>
<p>Then, click and drag a line from the foreground to the background in the Canvas. Drag the midpoint slider (where my cursor is) until the edge looks the best it can. Different video formats make this easy (ProRes), while others (HDV, avchd) make this much harder. Perfection is impossible – do the best you can.</p>
<p><img  
                     lazyload
                     src="/images/loading.svg"
                     data-src="https://images.wondershare.com/multimedia/fx-chroma-09a.jpg"
                      alt="fx chroma 09a"
                ></p>
<p>Final Cut provides four additional tweaks at the bottom of the keyer filter:</p>
<ul>
<li>Color Selection</li>
<li>Matte Tools</li>
<li>Spill Suppression</li>
<li>Light Wrap</li>
</ul>
<p>The first three are designed to clean up poorly shot keys – read the FCP X Help files to learn how these work. (I used the Color Selection tools to clean up the very dark key I use an example later in this article.)</p>
<p>Light wrap, though, is aesthetic. What it does is blend colors from the background into the edges of the foreground, to make the entire key look more “organic,” as if the foreground and background were actually in the same space.</p>
<p>This is a subtle effect, but very cool.</p>
<p><img  
                     lazyload
                     src="/images/loading.svg"
                     data-src="https://images.wondershare.com/multimedia/fx-chroma-10.jpg"
                      alt="fx chroma 10"
                ></p>
<p>Twirl down Light Wrap and adjust the Amount slider and watch what happens. Drag the other sliders around and see what happens. The nice thing about this setting is that when it looks good to you, it is good. The amount of the effect is totally up to you. Remember, Light Wrap only affects the edges of the foreground and should be used subtly.</p>
<p><img  
                     lazyload
                     src="/images/loading.svg"

                      alt="fx chroma 11"
                ></p>
<p>When you are done, you have a great looking key!</p>
<h2 id="Clean-up-the-Image-with-a-Garbage-Mask"><a href="#Clean-up-the-Image-with-a-Garbage-Mask" class="headerlink" title="Clean up the Image with a Garbage Mask"></a>Clean up the Image with a Garbage Mask</h2><p><img

                      alt="fx chroma 12"
                ></p>
<p>Sometimes, however, you don’t have, ah, perhaps, the best green-screen image to work with. Here, for example, there are lighting instruments in the foreground, with a very inadequately lit green screen in the background. (Sigh… this is just pitiful.)</p>
<p>Once you pull the key – which is film-speak for creating a green-screen shot, as I described above – and get it looking as good as possible, there’s one more step: adding a garbage matte to get rid of all the garbage surrounding your actors.</p>
<p><img  
                     lazyload
                     src="/images/loading.svg"
                     data-src="https://images.wondershare.com/multimedia/fx-chroma-13.jpg"
                      alt="fx chroma 13"
                ></p>
<p>Once you get your key looking as good as you can – which in this case isn’t all that good – drag the Mask effect (<strong>Effects &gt; Keying &gt; Mask</strong>) on top of the green-screen clip.</p>
<p><strong>NOTE</strong>: The Mask effect should always be added after the Keying effect, so that the Mask is below the Keyer in the Inspector.</p>
<p><img  
                     lazyload
                     src="/images/loading.svg"
                     data-src="https://images.wondershare.com/multimedia/fx-chroma-14.jpg"
                      alt="fx chroma 14"
                ></p>
<p>Then, drag each of the four circles to create a shape such that your foreground image is contained inside it, and everything you want to exclude is outside. Here, for instance, we removed the light stand, the edge of the green background and the tearing at the top of the image. I’ve found this Mask effect works best when applied to a connected clip.</p>

<h2 id="Getting-Started-1"><a href="#Getting-Started-1" class="headerlink" title="Getting Started"></a>Getting Started</h2><p>First, the best thing you can do to improve the quality of your keys is to improve how you shoot them. Here are seven basic production rules:</p>
<ul>
<li>Actors should be at least 10 feet in front of the green screen. This avoids light from the background “spilling” around their body or shoulders.</li>
<li>In general, don’t cast shadows on the green screen. Be very careful shooting feet.</li>
<li>The green background should be as smooth as possible. Paint is always better than fabric; avoid wrinkles and folds.</li>
<li>The green background should be lit smoothly, both from side to side and top to bottom. I try to have the green background display between 40-50% level on the waveform monitor.</li>
<li>There is NO relationship between how the background is lit and how your actors are lit. This article will illustrate that.</li>
<li>Light your background for smoothness. Light your actors for drama.</li>
<li>Don’t worry about having the green background fill the frame. It only needs to completely surround the edges of your actors. Garbage mattes are used to get rid of junk around the edges.</li>
</ul>
<h2 id="Setting-up-the-Key-1"><a href="#Setting-up-the-Key-1" class="headerlink" title="Setting up the Key"></a>Setting up the Key</h2><p><img  
                     lazyload
                     src="/images/loading.svg"
                     data-src="https://images.wondershare.com/multimedia/fx-chroma-01.jpg"
                      alt="fx chroma 01"
                ></p>
<p>The green screen image is always placed above the background. You can place either the green screen or background image into the Primary Storyline. I find it easier to put the background in the Primary Storyline, because it makes editing the green screen image easier. But this is purely personal choice.</p>
<p><strong>Step 1: Select the green screen clip</strong></p>
<p>From the <strong>Effects Browser &gt; Keying</strong> category, double-click the <strong>Keyer</strong> effect, which applies it to the selected clip. (You can also drag the effect on top of the clip, if you forgot to select the green-screen clip first.)</p>
<p><img  
                     lazyload
                     src="/images/loading.svg"

                      alt="fx chroma 02"
                ></p>
<p>Don’t panic if your image looks weird – we will fix it.</p>
<p><img  
                     lazyload
                     src="/images/loading.svg"
                     data-src="https://images.wondershare.com/multimedia/fx-chroma-03.jpg"
                      alt="fx chroma 03"
                ></p>
<p>Click the <strong>Sample Color</strong> icon. This allows fine-tuning the selection of the background color.</p>
<p><img  
                     lazyload
                     src="/images/loading.svg"
                     data-src="https://images.wondershare.com/multimedia/fx-chroma-04.jpg"
                      alt="fx chroma 04"
                ></p>
<p>In the green-screen image, drag to select a representative section of the background. I try to get close to the face, but not so close that I accidentally select loose hair or skin.</p>
<p>Your key should look better immediately. Most of the time, you can probably stop here. But there are three other adjustments that can make your key look even better:</p>
<ul>
<li>Cleaning up the matte</li>
<li>Edge adjustments</li>
<li>Light wrap</li>
</ul>
<p><img  
                     lazyload
                     src="/images/loading.svg"
                     data-src="https://images.wondershare.com/multimedia/fx-chroma-06.jpg"
                      alt="fx chroma 06"
                ></p>
<p>Click the <strong>Matte</strong> button to display your key as a white foreground on a black background.</p>
<p><img  
                     lazyload
                     src="/images/loading.svg"
                     data-src="https://images.wondershare.com/multimedia/fx-chroma-07.jpg"
                      alt="fx chroma 07"
                ></p>
<p>Your goal is the make the foreground solid white, which means opaque, and the background solid black, which means transparent. Adjust the <strong>Fill Holes</strong> and <strong>Edge Distance</strong> sliders until your key looks solid. (For REALLY bad keys, you’ll need to also adjust Color Selection, mentioned below.)</p>
<p><img  
                     lazyload
                     src="/images/loading.svg"
                     data-src="https://images.wondershare.com/multimedia/fx-chroma-05.jpg"
                      alt="fx chroma 05"
                ></p>
<p>If an edge is too pronounced, or needs help, click the <strong>Edges</strong> icon.</p>
<p><img  
                     lazyload
                     src="/images/loading.svg"
                     data-src="https://images.wondershare.com/multimedia/fx-chroma-09.jpg"
                      alt="fx chroma 09"
                ></p>
<p><strong>Step 2: Tweaks Video</strong></p>
<p>Then, click and drag a line from the foreground to the background in the Canvas. Drag the midpoint slider (where my cursor is) until the edge looks the best it can. Different video formats make this easy (ProRes), while others (HDV, avchd) make this much harder. Perfection is impossible – do the best you can.</p>
<p><img  
                     lazyload
                     src="/images/loading.svg"
                     data-src="https://images.wondershare.com/multimedia/fx-chroma-09a.jpg"
                      alt="fx chroma 09a"
                ></p>
<p>Final Cut provides four additional tweaks at the bottom of the keyer filter:</p>
<ul>
<li>Color Selection</li>
<li>Matte Tools</li>
<li>Spill Suppression</li>
<li>Light Wrap</li>
</ul>
<p>The first three are designed to clean up poorly shot keys – read the FCP X Help files to learn how these work. (I used the Color Selection tools to clean up the very dark key I use an example later in this article.)</p>
<p>Light wrap, though, is aesthetic. What it does is blend colors from the background into the edges of the foreground, to make the entire key look more “organic,” as if the foreground and background were actually in the same space.</p>
<p>This is a subtle effect, but very cool.</p>
<p><img  
                     lazyload
                     src="/images/loading.svg"
                     data-src="https://images.wondershare.com/multimedia/fx-chroma-10.jpg"
                      alt="fx chroma 10"
                ></p>
<p>Twirl down Light Wrap and adjust the Amount slider and watch what happens. Drag the other sliders around and see what happens. The nice thing about this setting is that when it looks good to you, it is good. The amount of the effect is totally up to you. Remember, Light Wrap only affects the edges of the foreground and should be used subtly.</p>
<p><img  
                     lazyload
                     src="/images/loading.svg"

                      alt="fx chroma 11"
                ></p>
<p>When you are done, you have a great looking key!</p>
<h2 id="Clean-up-the-Image-with-a-Garbage-Mask-1"><a href="#Clean-up-the-Image-with-a-Garbage-Mask-1" class="headerlink" title="Clean up the Image with a Garbage Mask"></a>Clean up the Image with a Garbage Mask</h2><p><img  
                     lazyload
                     src="/images/loading.svg"
                     data-src="https://images.wondershare.com/multimedia/fx-chroma-12.jpg"
                      alt="fx chroma 12"
                ></p>
<p>Sometimes, however, you don’t have, ah, perhaps, the best green-screen image to work with. Here, for example, there are lighting instruments in the foreground, with a very inadequately lit green screen in the background. (Sigh… this is just pitiful.)</p>
<p>Once you pull the key – which is film-speak for creating a green-screen shot, as I described above – and get it looking as good as possible, there’s one more step: adding a garbage matte to get rid of all the garbage surrounding your actors.</p>
<p><img  
                     lazyload
                     src="/images/loading.svg"
                     data-src="https://images.wondershare.com/multimedia/fx-chroma-13.jpg"
                      alt="fx chroma 13"
                ></p>
<p>Once you get your key looking as good as you can – which in this case isn’t all that good – drag the Mask effect (<strong>Effects &gt; Keying &gt; Mask</strong>) on top of the green-screen clip.</p>
<p><strong>NOTE</strong>: The Mask effect should always be added after the Keying effect, so that the Mask is below the Keyer in the Inspector.</p>
<p><img  
                     lazyload
                     src="/images/loading.svg"
                     data-src="https://images.wondershare.com/multimedia/fx-chroma-14.jpg"
                      alt="fx chroma 14"
                ></p>
<p>Then, drag each of the four circles to create a shape such that your foreground image is contained inside it, and everything you want to exclude is outside. Here, for instance, we removed the light stand, the edge of the green background and the tearing at the top of the image. I’ve found this Mask effect works best when applied to a connected clip.</p>
<p>However, the big limitation of the Mask effect is that you only have four points to work with. That’s where a free effect comes in, which allows you to create far more flexible shapes with it. It’s written by Alex Gollner and is available on his website – alex4d.wordpress.com&#x2F;fcpx&#x2F; – I recommend his effects highly.</p>

<p>In the green-screen image, drag to select a representative section of the background. I try to get close to the face, but not so close that I accidentally select loose hair or skin.</p>
<p>Your key should look better immediately. Most of the time, you can probably stop here. But there are three other adjustments that can make your key look even better:</p>
<ul>
<li>Cleaning up the matte</li>
<li>Edge adjustments</li>
<li>Light wrap</li>
</ul>
<p><img

                      alt="fx chroma 06"
                ></p>
<p>Click the <strong>Matte</strong> button to display your key as a white foreground on a black background.</p>
<p><img  
                     lazyload
                     src="/images/loading.svg"

                      alt="fx chroma 07"
                ></p>
<p>Your goal is the make the foreground solid white, which means opaque, and the background solid black, which means transparent. Adjust the <strong>Fill Holes</strong> and <strong>Edge Distance</strong> sliders until your key looks solid. (For REALLY bad keys, you’ll need to also adjust Color Selection, mentioned below.)</p>

                      alt="fx chroma 05"
                ></p>
<p>If an edge is too pronounced, or needs help, click the <strong>Edges</strong> icon.</p>

                ></p>
<p><strong>Step 2: Tweaks Video</strong></p>
<p>Then, click and drag a line from the foreground to the background in the Canvas. Drag the midpoint slider (where my cursor is) until the edge looks the best it can. Different video formats make this easy (ProRes), while others (HDV, avchd) make this much harder. Perfection is impossible – do the best you can.</p>
<p><img  
                     lazyload
                     src="/images/loading.svg"

                      alt="fx chroma 09a"
                ></p>
<p>Final Cut provides four additional tweaks at the bottom of the keyer filter:</p>
<ul>
<li>Color Selection</li>
<li>Matte Tools</li>
<li>Spill Suppression</li>
<li>Light Wrap</li>
</ul>
<p>The first three are designed to clean up poorly shot keys – read the FCP X Help files to learn how these work. (I used the Color Selection tools to clean up the very dark key I use an example later in this article.)</p>
<p>Light wrap, though, is aesthetic. What it does is blend colors from the background into the edges of the foreground, to make the entire key look more “organic,” as if the foreground and background were actually in the same space.</p>
<p>This is a subtle effect, but very cool.</p>
<p><img  
                     lazyload
                     src="/images/loading.svg"

                      alt="fx chroma 10"
                ></p>
<p>Twirl down Light Wrap and adjust the Amount slider and watch what happens. Drag the other sliders around and see what happens. The nice thing about this setting is that when it looks good to you, it is good. The amount of the effect is totally up to you. Remember, Light Wrap only affects the edges of the foreground and should be used subtly.</p>

<p>When you are done, you have a great looking key!</p>

                      alt="fx chroma 12"
                ></p>
<p>Sometimes, however, you don’t have, ah, perhaps, the best green-screen image to work with. Here, for example, there are lighting instruments in the foreground, with a very inadequately lit green screen in the background. (Sigh… this is just pitiful.)</p>
<p>Once you pull the key – which is film-speak for creating a green-screen shot, as I described above – and get it looking as good as possible, there’s one more step: adding a garbage matte to get rid of all the garbage surrounding your actors.</p>
<p><img  
                     lazyload
                     src="/images/loading.svg"

                      alt="fx chroma 13"
                ></p>
<p>Once you get your key looking as good as you can – which in this case isn’t all that good – drag the Mask effect (<strong>Effects &gt; Keying &gt; Mask</strong>) on top of the green-screen clip.</p>
<p><strong>NOTE</strong>: The Mask effect should always be added after the Keying effect, so that the Mask is below the Keyer in the Inspector.</p>
<p><img  
                     lazyload
                     src="/images/loading.svg"
                     data-src="https://images.wondershare.com/multimedia/fx-chroma-14.jpg"
                      alt="fx chroma 14"
                ></p>
<p>Then, drag each of the four circles to create a shape such that your foreground image is contained inside it, and everything you want to exclude is outside. Here, for instance, we removed the light stand, the edge of the green background and the tearing at the top of the image. I’ve found this Mask effect works best when applied to a connected clip.</p>
<p>However, the big limitation of the Mask effect is that you only have four points to work with. That’s where a free effect comes in, which allows you to create far more flexible shapes with it. It’s written by Alex Gollner and is available on his website – alex4d.wordpress.com&#x2F;fcpx&#x2F; – I recommend his effects highly.</p>

<h2 id="Getting-Started-3"><a href="#Getting-Started-3" class="headerlink" title="Getting Started"></a>Getting Started</h2><p>First, the best thing you can do to improve the quality of your keys is to improve how you shoot them. Here are seven basic production rules:</p>
<ul>
<li>Actors should be at least 10 feet in front of the green screen. This avoids light from the background “spilling” around their body or shoulders.</li>
<li>In general, don’t cast shadows on the green screen. Be very careful shooting feet.</li>
<li>The green background should be as smooth as possible. Paint is always better than fabric; avoid wrinkles and folds.</li>
<li>The green background should be lit smoothly, both from side to side and top to bottom. I try to have the green background display between 40-50% level on the waveform monitor.</li>
<li>There is NO relationship between how the background is lit and how your actors are lit. This article will illustrate that.</li>
<li>Light your background for smoothness. Light your actors for drama.</li>
<li>Don’t worry about having the green background fill the frame. It only needs to completely surround the edges of your actors. Garbage mattes are used to get rid of junk around the edges.</li>
</ul>
<h2 id="Setting-up-the-Key-3"><a href="#Setting-up-the-Key-3" class="headerlink" title="Setting up the Key"></a>Setting up the Key</h2><p><img

                ></p>
<p>The green screen image is always placed above the background. You can place either the green screen or background image into the Primary Storyline. I find it easier to put the background in the Primary Storyline, because it makes editing the green screen image easier. But this is purely personal choice.</p>
<p><strong>Step 1: Select the green screen clip</strong></p>
<p>From the <strong>Effects Browser &gt; Keying</strong> category, double-click the <strong>Keyer</strong> effect, which applies it to the selected clip. (You can also drag the effect on top of the clip, if you forgot to select the green-screen clip first.)</p>

<p>Sometimes, however, you don’t have, ah, perhaps, the best green-screen image to work with. Here, for example, there are lighting instruments in the foreground, with a very inadequately lit green screen in the background. (Sigh… this is just pitiful.)</p>
<p>Once you pull the key – which is film-speak for creating a green-screen shot, as I described above – and get it looking as good as possible, there’s one more step: adding a garbage matte to get rid of all the garbage surrounding your actors.</p>

                      alt="fx chroma 13"
                ></p>
<p>Once you get your key looking as good as you can – which in this case isn’t all that good – drag the Mask effect (<strong>Effects &gt; Keying &gt; Mask</strong>) on top of the green-screen clip.</p>
<p><strong>NOTE</strong>: The Mask effect should always be added after the Keying effect, so that the Mask is below the Keyer in the Inspector.</p>
<p><img  
                     lazyload
                     src="/images/loading.svg"
                     data-src="https://images.wondershare.com/multimedia/fx-chroma-14.jpg"
                      alt="fx chroma 14"
                ></p>
<p>Then, drag each of the four circles to create a shape such that your foreground image is contained inside it, and everything you want to exclude is outside. Here, for instance, we removed the light stand, the edge of the green background and the tearing at the top of the image. I’ve found this Mask effect works best when applied to a connected clip.</p>
<p>However, the big limitation of the Mask effect is that you only have four points to work with. That’s where a free effect comes in, which allows you to create far more flexible shapes with it. It’s written by Alex Gollner and is available on his website – alex4d.wordpress.com&#x2F;fcpx&#x2F; – I recommend his effects highly.</p>

<p>As it is now the second decade of the 21st century, data carriers like DVDs are slowly becoming obsolete. A growing number of laptop and desktop PCs no longer feature optical disc drives, while the discontinuation of the Windows Media Center marked the end of an era in which Windows OS offered a built-in DVD player.</p>
<p>The Windows 10 doesn’t have a native app that enables you to play movies or music from DVD and Blu-ray discs, and you must install a third-party DVD<a class="link"   target="_blank" rel="noopener" href="https://tools.techidaily.com/wondershare/filmora/download/" >video player <i class="fa-regular fa-arrow-up-right-from-square fa-sm"></i></a> if you want to view content from these sources. Luckily there is no shortage of media players that are compatible with Windows 10, so in this article, we are going to take you through some of the <strong>best free DVD players</strong> on the market and help you choose the one that meets all your needs.</p>
<h2 id="Best-Free-DVD-Players-for-Windows-10"><a href="#Best-Free-DVD-Players-for-Windows-10" class="headerlink" title="Best Free DVD Players for Windows 10"></a>Best Free DVD Players for Windows 10</h2><p>Before you opt for one DVD player or the other you must first check which audio and <a class="link"   target="_blank" rel="noopener" href="https://tools.techidaily.com/wondershare/filmora/download/" >video file formats <i class="fa-regular fa-arrow-up-right-from-square fa-sm"></i></a> they support or find out if you can use them to play Blu-ray discs.

<p>The Surround Sound support enhances the audio playback and provides a theater-like experience to the viewers.

Its video playback features are nothing short of amazing since GOM enables you to play videos in various resolutions and file formats. However, if you would like to use this media player to open Blu-ray discs you must ensure that you have the necessary codecs.

<p>Besides stunning video playback capabilities that even allow you to view 360° VR videos, GOM also features an extensive subtitle library.

The video and audio playback tools MPC-HC has to offer cannot be compared to those provided by VLC or even GOM media player as it only features the basic options you need to play a DVD or a Blu-ray disc. Moreover, the process of playing a DVD with MPC-HC is quite technical as you must adjust the media player’s settings in order to play content from that source.</p>
<p>The codecs you will have to install on your PC depends on the type of content you would like to watch. MPC-HC provides support for  or  codecs, but it is better to install a full codec pack and ensure that you have all the codecs you need to play audio and video files.

A growing number of laptop and desktop PCs no longer feature optical disc drives, while the discontinuation of the Windows Media Center marked the end of an era in which Windows OS offered a built-in DVD player.</p>
<p>The Windows 10 doesn’t have a native app that enables you to play movies or music from DVD and Blu-ray discs, and you must install a third-party DVD<a class="link"   target="_blank" rel="noopener" href="https://tools.techidaily.com/wondershare/filmora/download/" >video player <i class="fa-regular fa-arrow-up-right-from-square fa-sm"></i></a> if you want to view content from these sources.

<h3 id="10-Macgo-Windows-Blu-ray-3"><a href="#10-Macgo-Windows-Blu-ray-3" class="headerlink" title="10. Macgo Windows Blu-ray"></a>10. <a class="link"   target="_blank" rel="noopener" href="https://www.macblurayplayer.com/windows-bluray-player.htm#specs" >Macgo Windows Blu-ray <i class="fa-regular fa-arrow-up-right-from-square fa-sm"></i></a></h3><p>Even though this media player is primarily designed for macOS, the manufacturer announced that the Windows version of the app is going to become available soon. The Macgo Windows Blu-ray player is expected to offer support for a broad range of Blu-ray file formats and video files, which should enable its users to watch or listen to content without any restrictions. The media player can also display a variety of photo file formats, including CR2 files, and its users can utilize it to browse through their photo collections and ever view RAW files.</p>
<p>The current Mac-based versions of the software offer support for Dolby TrueHD Audio DTS-HD Master Audio and DTS 5.1 codecs that ensure you can hear every sound in a video accurately. Macgo Windows Blu-ray should also be equipped with a range of subtitle options that allow you to customize the color, size or the font of a video’s subtitles.</p>
<p><strong>Pros</strong></p>
<ul>
<li>Supports nearly all Blu-ray and video file formats</li>
<li>Powerful audio playback features</li>
<li>Displays image files</li>
<li>Offers online video playback options</li>
</ul>
<p><strong>Cons</strong></p>
<ul>
<li>This Blu-ray and DVD player is still in Beta stage</li>
</ul>
<p><strong>Conclusion</strong></p>
<p>Even though Windows 10 doesn’t have a native DVD or Blu-ray players, finding a media player that enables you to watch video and audio content from Blu-ray or DVD discs shouldn’t be too difficult. Media players like Pot Player or VLC are powerful enough to provide smooth playback of all audio and video files for free, while DVD players like PowerDVD or KMPlayer are a better option if you are looking for a true home theater experience. Which DVD player for Windows 10 are you going to choose? Leave a comment and let us know.</p>
