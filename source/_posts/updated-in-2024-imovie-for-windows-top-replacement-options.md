**Takeaway**

Lightworks is a fantastic alternative to iMovie for Windows 10+ users. However, it requires you to be quite knowledgeable about video editing tools. This editor has a slightly higher learning curve than others. But once you learn how to use Lightworks, creating quality videos would be super easy.

**Takeaway**

You can't go wrong with FlexClip. It has powerful tools making it a great iMovie alternative for Windows. You don't even have to install it; it's an online tool.
