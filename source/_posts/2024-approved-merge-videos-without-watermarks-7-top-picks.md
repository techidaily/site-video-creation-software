02 [Why Choose Online YouTube to MP4 Converter?](#Part 2)

## Part 1 The Only Guide You'll Ever Need to Learn about YouTube to MP4 Video Converter

### 01**What is the MP4 format?**

![mp4 format](https://images.wondershare.com/filmora/article-images/2021/solution-for-choosing-fast-youtube-to-mp4-video-converter-02.jpg)

MP4 files were executed under the ISO/IEC 14496-12:2001 standard by the IEC/ISO and Motion Picture Experts Group (MPEG). MP4 is an international specification for audio-visual coding only because of this.

The high degree of compression used in MP4 videos assists the files to be much smaller in size than other video formats. Minimizing the file size doesn't suddenly affect the file quality, either. Almost the entire original quality retains, making MP4 a web-friendly and portable video format.

They shouldn't be confused with M4A and MP3, while MP4 files can play audio.

It can also help to store the other kinds of data files, such as different subtitles and still images.

This media container allows a blend of video, audio, subtitles, and still images to be present only in a single file. It also assists in storing advanced content like 3D Graphics, interactivity of the menus, and the users. This tool is highly accessible, and everyone can use it with simplicity.

### 02**Pros and Cons of the MP4 format**

**Pros of the MP4 format**

One of the critical merits of the MP4 format is that it can be valuable on different platforms.

**●** It consists of a high degree of compression while producing smaller file sizes, making it a perfect fit for compressing or video streaming HD audio-video files.

**●** An MP4 file can contain metadata and Extensible Meta Data Platform such as images based on PNG or JPEG format, subtitles, among others, and PDF.

**●** Compatible with metadata integrable with 3D graphics, user navigation or menus options, and other user interaction features.

**●** There are numerous open-source players, such as VLC Media Player, that offer full format support, even used on Linux OS.

**●** It is also versatile. For example, audio files coded with the M4A extension and MPEG-4 visual bitstreams encoded in the M4V extension.

**Cons of the MP4 format**

Note that the format is a container. This means that instead of storing the ode for the file, it keeps the data. Moreover, a specific MP4 file is based upon particular codecs because it does not have a native way of managing the involved coding.

A possible drawback is that there are hundreds of codecs available. Therefore, a media player must run a set of codecs concerning a particular MP4 file.

Yet, because the container format has become widely used, widely-supported codecs have become standards.

**●** Audio can drift out of the way or connect with the video in specific scenarios because of codec-player or codecs compatibility issues.

**●** Because a single file can contain video and audio and different metadata, editing or playback or editing needs various computing resources.

**●** It is still a lossy format. A higher compression format and smaller file size would result in audio and video quality losses.

**●** The familiarity of the MP4 format, coupled with its portability, has also enabled the illegal distribution of copyrighted audio-video files.

### 03**Is it possible to convert videos to MP4 without any software?**

No, it's impossible to do this conversion task without using any **YouTube to MP4** **video converter**. So you need to either get help from **free** **YouTube to MP4** **converter** or **YouTube MP4 converter HD** for the purpose.

## Part 1 The Only Guide You'll Ever Need to Learn about YouTube to MP4 Video Converter

### 01**What is the MP4 format?**

![mp4 format](https://images.wondershare.com/filmora/article-images/2021/solution-for-choosing-fast-youtube-to-mp4-video-converter-02.jpg)

MP4 files were executed under the ISO/IEC 14496-12:2001 standard by the IEC/ISO and Motion Picture Experts Group (MPEG). MP4 is an international specification for audio-visual coding only because of this.

The high degree of compression used in MP4 videos assists the files to be much smaller in size than other video formats. Minimizing the file size doesn't suddenly affect the file quality, either. Almost the entire original quality retains, making MP4 a web-friendly and portable video format.

They shouldn't be confused with M4A and MP3, while MP4 files can play audio.

It can also help to store the other kinds of data files, such as different subtitles and still images.

**●** There are numerous open-source players, such as VLC Media Player, that offer full format support, even used on Linux OS.

**●** It is also versatile. For example, audio files coded with the M4A extension and MPEG-4 visual bitstreams encoded in the M4V extension.

**Cons of the MP4 format**

Note that the format is a container. This means that instead of storing the ode for the file, it keeps the data. Moreover, a specific MP4 file is based upon particular codecs because it does not have a native way of managing the involved coding.

A possible drawback is that there are hundreds of codecs available. Therefore, a media player must run a set of codecs concerning a particular MP4 file.

Yet, because the container format has become widely used, widely-supported codecs have become standards.

**●** Audio can drift out of the way or connect with the video in specific scenarios because of codec-player or codecs compatibility issues.

**●** Because a single file can contain video and audio and different metadata, editing or playback or editing needs various computing resources.

**●** It is still a lossy format. A higher compression format and smaller file size would result in audio and video quality losses.

**●** The familiarity of the MP4 format, coupled with its portability, has also enabled the illegal distribution of copyrighted audio-video files.
