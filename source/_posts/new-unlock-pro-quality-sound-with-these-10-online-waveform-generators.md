The modern video editing software comes with the feature of smart auto reframing. This feature allows you to upload your video according to the platform where you want to upload it. For example, if you need to upload a video on YouTube, you can set the aspect ratio in the landscape interface. And if you want to upload your video on Instagram, you can set the aspect ratio to vertical format. These tools also allow you to set video dimensions. They not only allow you to edit videos but also the images having motion.
