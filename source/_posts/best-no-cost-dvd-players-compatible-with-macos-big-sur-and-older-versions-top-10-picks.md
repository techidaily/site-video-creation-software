## No. 2 VLC - Open-source Free DVD Player for Mac

VLC is an open source media player which supports playing audios, videos, DVD, CD, VCD, etc. for free. As a cross-platform DVD player freeware, it is compatible with not only Mac OS, but also Windows, Linux, Android, and iOS. Technically, this free DVD player for Mac allows you to play encrypted DVDs without third party help. However, it sometimes runs into problems like [VLC can't play DVD on Mac](https://tools.techidaily.com/5kplayer/video-music-player/) OS X Mavericks 10.9/Yosemite 10.10, [VLC Audio Delay](https://tools.techidaily.com/5kplayer/video-music-player/), [VLC won't play H.265 HEVC](https://tools.techidaily.com/5kplayer/video-music-player/), etc.

![DVD Player KMPlayer](https://www.5kplayer.com/video-music-player/img/km-player.jpg) 

## No. 3 KMPlayer - Multi-functional Mac DVD player

Just like VLC, KMPlayer is also an open source media player software for playing almost any media files, from VCD to DVD, and from MP4 to MKV thanks to the self-contained video audio codecs. The bonus features of this multi-functional Mac DVD player is that it can cope with damaged/incomplete AVI file, and takes very little space in your Mac. But ads pop up constantly when you are using it, and bundled applications are also annoying, forcing you to look for a [KMPlayer Mac alternative](https://tools.techidaily.com/5kplayer/video-music-player/).

## No. 4 QuickTime - The Default DVD Player for macOS

Since QuickTime is the default video/DVD player for Mac OS X, it is obviously one of the best options for Mac users to play DVDs. This free DVD player supports commonly used video audio formats with bonus functions like video/music recording, editing and streaming. Unfortunately, it only has support for limited video formats and requires frequent update.

Apple DVD Player is the default DVD player in Mac OS X. It supports all kinds of standard DVD features including multiple audio, video and subtitle tracks.
