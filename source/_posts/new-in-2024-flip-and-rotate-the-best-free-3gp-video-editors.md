## Part 4: Top 5 Warp Stabilizer Tips and Troubleshooting

 **Premiere Pro stabilize** is a powerful tool, but it also carries some limitations. Let's check them out!

**1\. Consider warp stabilize during shooting:**

If you keep in mind the warp stabilizer function while filming your videos or photos, you'll get rid of fixing problems after the work. So, if you want glossy touch in your shots with zero access to a gimbal, you should consider filming with a faster shutter speed or a wider frame. In this way, you'll get more convenience while applying the effect in the edit.

**2\. Modify extra cropping in your footage:**

Warp stabilizer is a tool that can provide you stable footage and crop your shot as well. It can crop out the edges of your photos or videos, giving you a smooth and clean shot. To adjust the cropping in your clips, go to advanced settings and then click on Crop less <-> Smooth More Slider.

**3\. Analyze the effect of Warp stabilizer:**

Always check the order of effects in the ''Effect Controls'' folder. If you ever lost some stabilization after editing your shot, ensure not to change the Warp Stabilizer analysis source. Further, you should always re-analyze your clip after a quick color fix.

**4\. Nest your clips:**

Sometimes we got an error message in the form of a red banner across our footage while trying to modify the speed on **premiere stabilize video**. Basically, we can't use a Warp stabilizer to alter the speed of the same clip. But no worries! There is an easy fix – click on the altered clip and then click on Nest.

Also, it can help if you want to make a similar effect to your multiple projects.

### Step 7

To trim the video, click the Trim button.

![trim video with kapwing](https://images.wondershare.com/filmora/article-images/2022/02/kapwing-video-trimmer-6.png)

Click and drag the ends of your video to adjust the end and start times of the video layer. Anything that you remove won't be in the final video.

![steps to trim video with kapwing](https://images.wondershare.com/filmora/article-images/2022/02/kapwing-video-trimmer-7.png)

If you have more layers on your project, click and select the layer you would like to trim.

### Step 8

You can also use the Timing tab to trim your video. To do this, click your clip and head over to the top right side of your screen.

![use timing to trim video with kapwing](https://images.wondershare.com/filmora/article-images/2022/02/kapwing-video-trimmer-8.png)

You can now specify the exact time you would like the video to start and end instead of using the clicking and dragging method.

![use timing to trim video with kapwing - set time range](https://images.wondershare.com/filmora/article-images/2022/02/kapwing-video-trimmer-9.png)

Clicking the numerals will allow you to use the up and down arrow keys and trim the video to start and end where you have specified.

You can also use the seeker to set the time where you would like the video to start and end, and then go to the numerals and click set to the current time.

Kapwing Video Trimmer will create a huge gap when you select this option. You'll see a blank white canvas until the video starts.

You can leave this white space and add other clips or remove it so that your video starts at zero by clicking it and hitting the Delete key on your keyboard.

### Step 9

Once you have finished trimming your video with Video Trimmer Kapwing, click the Export Video button.

![export trim vieo in kapwing](https://images.wondershare.com/filmora/article-images/2022/02/kapwing-video-trimmer-10.png)

You'll have to sign in to remove the watermark. Click the Download button to download the trimmed video to your device.

## Extra Information About Kapwing Editor

Now that you know how to trim videos with Kapwing Video Trimmer let's look at five things about this online editing tool that you need to know.

#### 1\. You Can Cut and Split Parts of Your Videos

With the Kapwing Video Editing tool, you can cut out the middle of your video clip by using the split key. You only need to drag the seeker to where you would like to cut out, then click the Split button. Doing this will turn the original video clip into two clips that you drag to trim down any part that you do not want to appear in your video.

#### 2\. How to Collaborate With Kapwing

Kapwing allows you to work as a group remotely and in real-time while accessing each other's files. The tool is also ideal for teams, outsourced workers, and virtual assistants. All you have to do is invite your peers or colleagues to a Workspace, and Kaping will allow you to work together on GIF, video, and image edits.

To share your Kapwing Workspace to collaborate with other users without giving them your log-in information, follow the steps below.

* Simply go to the folder you would like to share and hit the Share button.
* You'll then have to type in the email address of the person you want to share the folder with.
* Once you have done this, click the Send Invite button to copy and send a link to an invitation to your folder.

Your collaborator needs to open the email with the link and click Join Now. They'll also have to create an account by linking their Facebook or Google account and then accept the invite again once they have signed in.

#### 3\. You Can Add Audio and Text to Your Video

Kapwing editor allows you to add audio and text using two methods: subtitles and text boxes. Use single text boxes for information, names, titles, and labels. To do this, hit the Text button located in the upper toolbar, then enter the text you want into the box.

All the text editing options will appear on the right, including angle, position, style, outline, color, and font. The Anime tab allows you to add up to 10 different animations to the text box. Additionally, you can add subtitles to your videos if you want your audience to follow along while listening to the spoken words in the video.

#### 4\. Share Your Videos With Others

After creating your video project, you can share it with others from the download page. You can share your video directly on Instagram. Twitter, and Facebook. You can also copy the video's link and then send it to anyone you want, and they will be able to view it.
