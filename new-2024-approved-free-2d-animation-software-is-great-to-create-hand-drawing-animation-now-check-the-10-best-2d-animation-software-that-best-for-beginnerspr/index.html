<h2 id="Part-3-How-to-Make-2D-Animation"><a href="#Part-3-How-to-Make-2D-Animation" class="headerlink" title="Part 3: How to Make 2D Animation"></a>Part 3: How to Make 2D Animation</h2><p> <strong>Step 1  Put forward an idea</strong></p>
<p>A story ides is priceless. It is always important to build an essential story frame. Sometimes it is in a blink to have come up with an idea.</p>
<p>It will help if you <strong>decide the gist</strong> of your 2D animation because the whole process of making animation is evolving. You may need to add or cut some scenes, but the overall concept and story ideas are always the same.</p>
<p><img

                     src="/images/loading.svg"
                     data-src="https://images.wondershare.com/filmora/article-images/2022/01/10-best-2d-animation-software-in-2022-01.gif"
                      alt="Put forward an idea"
                ></p>
<p> <strong>Step 2  Make a storyboard</strong></p>
<p>After all the ideas are fixed, you need to <a class="link"   target="_blank" rel="noopener" href="https://www.bloopanimation.com/how-to-storyboard/" >make a storyboard for animation <i class="fa-regular fa-arrow-up-right-from-square fa-sm"></i></a>. You don’t need to produce every scene, but it is suggested to make a storyboard in some crucial scenes. Storyboarding is probably the best way to show 2D animation to other people and get feedback.</p>
<p>Thus, it is a step that you should not neglect during the preliminary.</p>
<p><img  
                     lazyload
                     src="/images/loading.svg"
                     data-src="https://images.wondershare.com/filmora/article-images/2022/01/10-best-2d-animation-software-in-2022-02.gif"
                      alt="make storyboard"
                ></p>
<p> <strong>Step 3  Produce materials</strong></p>
<p>At this stage, you need to prepare all the 2D animation materials, including characters, background, and props. One thing you need to know is all the preparations in steps 2 and 3 should be ready before proceeding to step 3.</p>
<p><img  
                     lazyload
                     src="/images/loading.svg"
                     data-src="https://images.wondershare.com/filmora/article-images/2022/01/10-best-2d-animation-software-in-2022-03.gif"
                      alt="Produce materials"
                ></p>
<p> <strong>Step 4  Animation</strong></p>
<p>After all, materials are ready, and you need to make animation alive. In this step, you need to make sure all the movements are natural. Stiff moves are not liked by the audience, so you need to think about how to design gestures, movements, and facial expressions.</p>
<p><img  
                     lazyload
                     src="/images/loading.svg"

                      alt="Animation"
                ></p>
<p> <strong>Step 5  Animation editing</strong></p>
<p>In this step, the software is the key to relive the 2D animation. <a class="link"   target="_blank" rel="noopener" href="https://tools.techidaily.com/wondershare/filmora/download/" >Background audio is essential <i class="fa-regular fa-arrow-up-right-from-square fa-sm"></i></a> and needs to be added to the video. Color correction and grading are also necessary. Besides, scene transition, voiceover, and even text credit need to be added.</p>
<p>Above are the five 2D animation steps. If you think there are extra steps, you are free to add them according to your needs.</p>

<h2 id="Part-3-How-to-Make-2D-Animation-1"><a href="#Part-3-How-to-Make-2D-Animation-1" class="headerlink" title="Part 3: How to Make 2D Animation"></a>Part 3: How to Make 2D Animation</h2><p> <strong>Step 1  Put forward an idea</strong></p>
<p>A story ides is priceless. It is always important to build an essential story frame. Sometimes it is in a blink to have come up with an idea.</p>
<p>It will help if you <strong>decide the gist</strong> of your 2D animation because the whole process of making animation is evolving. You may need to add or cut some scenes, but the overall concept and story ideas are always the same.</p>
<p><img  
                     lazyload
                     src="/images/loading.svg"
                     data-src="https://images.wondershare.com/filmora/article-images/2022/01/10-best-2d-animation-software-in-2022-01.gif"
                      alt="Put forward an idea"
                ></p>
<p> <strong>Step 2  Make a storyboard</strong></p>
<p>After all the ideas are fixed, you need to <a class="link"   target="_blank" rel="noopener" href="https://www.bloopanimation.com/how-to-storyboard/" >make a storyboard for animation <i class="fa-regular fa-arrow-up-right-from-square fa-sm"></i></a>. You don’t need to produce every scene, but it is suggested to make a storyboard in some crucial scenes. Storyboarding is probably the best way to show 2D animation to other people and get feedback.</p>
<p>Thus, it is a step that you should not neglect during the preliminary.</p>
<p><img  
                     lazyload
                     src="/images/loading.svg"
                     data-src="https://images.wondershare.com/filmora/article-images/2022/01/10-best-2d-animation-software-in-2022-02.gif"
                      alt="make storyboard"
                ></p>
<p> <strong>Step 3  Produce materials</strong></p>
<p>At this stage, you need to prepare all the 2D animation materials, including characters, background, and props. One thing you need to know is all the preparations in steps 2 and 3 should be ready before proceeding to step 3.</p>
<p><img  
                     lazyload
                     src="/images/loading.svg"

                      alt="Produce materials"
                ></p>
<p> <strong>Step 4  Animation</strong></p>
<p>After all, materials are ready, and you need to make animation alive. In this step, you need to make sure all the movements are natural. Stiff moves are not liked by the audience, so you need to think about how to design gestures, movements, and facial expressions.</p>
<p><img  
                     lazyload
                     src="/images/loading.svg"

                      alt="Animation"
                ></p>
<p> <strong>Step 5  Animation editing</strong></p>
<p>In this step, the software is the key to relive the 2D animation. <a class="link"   target="_blank" rel="noopener" href="https://tools.techidaily.com/wondershare/filmora/download/" >Background audio is essential <i class="fa-regular fa-arrow-up-right-from-square fa-sm"></i></a> and needs to be added to the video. Color correction and grading are also necessary. Besides, scene transition, voiceover, and even text credit need to be added.</p>
<p>Above are the five 2D animation steps. If you think there are extra steps, you are free to add them according to your needs.</p>

<h2 id="Part-3-How-to-Make-2D-Animation-2"><a href="#Part-3-How-to-Make-2D-Animation-2" class="headerlink" title="Part 3: How to Make 2D Animation"></a>Part 3: How to Make 2D Animation</h2><p> <strong>Step 1  Put forward an idea</strong></p>
<p>A story ides is priceless. It is always important to build an essential story frame. Sometimes it is in a blink to have come up with an idea.</p>
<p>It will help if you <strong>decide the gist</strong> of your 2D animation because the whole process of making animation is evolving. You may need to add or cut some scenes, but the overall concept and story ideas are always the same.</p>
<p><img  
                     lazyload
                     src="/images/loading.svg"
                     data-src="https://images.wondershare.com/filmora/article-images/2022/01/10-best-2d-animation-software-in-2022-01.gif"
                      alt="Put forward an idea"
                ></p>
<p> <strong>Step 2  Make a storyboard</strong></p>
<p>After all the ideas are fixed, you need to <a class="link"   target="_blank" rel="noopener" href="https://www.bloopanimation.com/how-to-storyboard/" >make a storyboard for animation <i class="fa-regular fa-arrow-up-right-from-square fa-sm"></i></a>. You don’t need to produce every scene, but it is suggested to make a storyboard in some crucial scenes. Storyboarding is probably the best way to show 2D animation to other people and get feedback.</p>
<p>Thus, it is a step that you should not neglect during the preliminary.</p>
<p><img  
                     lazyload
                     src="/images/loading.svg"
                     data-src="https://images.wondershare.com/filmora/article-images/2022/01/10-best-2d-animation-software-in-2022-02.gif"
                      alt="make storyboard"
                ></p>
<p> <strong>Step 3  Produce materials</strong></p>
<p>At this stage, you need to prepare all the 2D animation materials, including characters, background, and props. One thing you need to know is all the preparations in steps 2 and 3 should be ready before proceeding to step 3.</p>
<p><img  
                     lazyload
                     src="/images/loading.svg"
                     data-src="https://images.wondershare.com/filmora/article-images/2022/01/10-best-2d-animation-software-in-2022-03.gif"
                      alt="Produce materials"
                ></p>
<p> <strong>Step 4  Animation</strong></p>
<p>After all, materials are ready, and you need to make animation alive. In this step, you need to make sure all the movements are natural. Stiff moves are not liked by the audience, so you need to think about how to design gestures, movements, and facial expressions.</p>
<p><img  
                     lazyload
                     src="/images/loading.svg"
                     data-src="https://images.wondershare.com/filmora/article-images/2022/01/10-best-2d-animation-software-in-2022-04.gif"
                      alt="Animation"
                ></p>
<p> <strong>Step 5  Animation editing</strong></p>
<p>In this step, the software is the key to relive the 2D animation. <a class="link"   target="_blank" rel="noopener" href="https://tools.techidaily.com/wondershare/filmora/download/" >Background audio is essential <i class="fa-regular fa-arrow-up-right-from-square fa-sm"></i></a> and needs to be added to the video. Color correction and grading are also necessary. Besides, scene transition, voiceover, and even text credit need to be added.</p>
<p>Above are the five 2D animation steps. If you think there are extra steps, you are free to add them according to your needs.</p>
<h2 id="Bonus-tip-Create-an-Animation-Video-with-Anireel-2"><a href="#Bonus-tip-Create-an-Animation-Video-with-Anireel-2" class="headerlink" title="Bonus tip: Create an Animation Video with Anireel"></a>Bonus tip: Create an Animation Video with Anireel</h2><p><a target="_blank" rel="noopener" href="https://tools.techidaily.com/wondershare/anireel/download/"><strong>Anireel</strong></a> provides a faster and smoother animated video creation experience with customizable elements to bring anyone’s imagination to life.

<p>A story ides is priceless. It is always important to build an essential story frame. Sometimes it is in a blink to have come up with an idea.</p>
<p>It will help if you <strong>decide the gist</strong> of your 2D animation because the whole process of making animation is evolving. You may need to add or cut some scenes, but the overall concept and story ideas are always the same.</p>
<p><img

                      alt="Put forward an idea"
                ></p>
<p> <strong>Step 2  Make a storyboard</strong></p>
<p>After all the ideas are fixed, you need to <a class="link"   target="_blank" rel="noopener" href="https://www.bloopanimation.com/how-to-storyboard/" >make a storyboard for animation <i class="fa-regular fa-arrow-up-right-from-square fa-sm"></i></a>. You don’t need to produce every scene, but it is suggested to make a storyboard in some crucial scenes. Storyboarding is probably the best way to show 2D animation to other people and get feedback.</p>
<p>Thus, it is a step that you should not neglect during the preliminary.</p>
<p><img

                      alt="make storyboard"
                ></p>
<p> <strong>Step 3  Produce materials</strong></p>
<p>At this stage, you need to prepare all the 2D animation materials, including characters, background, and props. One thing you need to know is all the preparations in steps 2 and 3 should be ready before proceeding to step 3.</p>
<p><img  
                     lazyload

                      alt="Produce materials"
                ></p>
<p> <strong>Step 4  Animation</strong></p>
<p>After all, materials are ready, and you need to make animation alive. In this step, you need to make sure all the movements are natural. Stiff moves are not liked by the audience, so you need to think about how to design gestures, movements, and facial expressions.</p>

<p> <strong>Step 5  Animation editing</strong></p>
<p>In this step, the software is the key to relive the 2D animation. <a class="link"   target="_blank" rel="noopener" href="https://tools.techidaily.com/wondershare/filmora/download/" >Background audio is essential <i class="fa-regular fa-arrow-up-right-from-square fa-sm"></i></a> and needs to be added to the video. Color correction and grading are also necessary. Besides, scene transition, voiceover, and even text credit need to be added.</p>
<p>Above are the five 2D animation steps. If you think there are extra steps, you are free to add them according to your needs.</p>

<p>Shooting videos in high resolutions can help you create visually impressive content your followers on social media are going to adore. The only trouble is that the size of 4K videos can slow you down during the video editing process if your computer doesn’t have enough RAM memory or processing power. Additionally, quite a few inexpensive or free video editing apps don’t allow their users to create low-resolution proxy files that make the process of editing 4K videos much faster. That’s why in this article we are going to take you through the best 8 video editors you can use for 4K proxy video editing.</p>

However, even if you have a computer setup that can easily support processing of the 4K video files, proxy editing can still be useful as it can reduce the amount of time you will have to spend on performing complex video editing tasks. Let’s take a look at some of the best video editors that support proxy editing.</p>

<p>The wide range of video editing options, support for nearly all popular video file formats or quick and simple exporting process are only a few reasons why Filmora is one of the best video editors you can use this year. Creating proxy files in Filmora is not a difficult task, because the software generates them automatically for you. You just have to choose between the <strong>1280x720p or 1920x1080p resolutions</strong> and Filmora will create proxies for all media files that are larger than the resolution you’ve selected. However, the amount of time Filmora is going to need to create proxies depends on your computer’s processing power, but also on the size and the number of the RAW files you imported into a project.</p>
<h4 id="2-Adobe-Premiere-Pro-CC"><a href="#2-Adobe-Premiere-Pro-CC" class="headerlink" title="2. Adobe Premiere Pro CC"></a>2. <a class="link"   target="_blank" rel="noopener" href="https://www.adobe.com/products/premiere.html" >Adobe Premiere Pro CC <i class="fa-regular fa-arrow-up-right-from-square fa-sm"></i></a></h4><p><strong>Price:</strong> $20,99 per month, different subscription plans available</p>
<p><strong>Compatibility:</strong> Windows, macOS</p>
<p>This is probably one of the best, if not the best non-linear video editing software ever created, so it is hardly surprising that you can easily create proxy files for all videos you use in a project you create in Adobe Premiere Pro. So, to create proxy files you just need to open the folder that contains those files from the <strong>Media Browser</strong> and then click on the <strong>Ingest button</strong>. You should then click on the <strong>wrench tool</strong> and pick the <strong>Create Proxies option</strong> from the drop-down menu located next to the <strong>Ingest option</strong>. Afterward, you should select one of the available resolution presets and proceed to import the footage into the project. However, before you can start editing with proxies you have to click on the <strong>Toggle Proxy button</strong>.</p>
<h4 id="3-Final-Cut-Pro-X"><a href="#3-Final-Cut-Pro-X" class="headerlink" title="3. Final Cut Pro X"></a>3. <a class="link"   target="_blank" rel="noopener" href="https://www.apple.com/lae/final-cut-pro/" >Final Cut Pro X <i class="fa-regular fa-arrow-up-right-from-square fa-sm"></i></a></h4><p><strong>Price:</strong> Free trial available, $299,99</p>
<p><strong>Compatibility:</strong> macOS</p>
<p>Transcoding media with FCPX doesn’t require too much effort, as the software offers a couple of options that make the editing process faster. You can opt to <strong>generate optimized media files</strong> by transcoding the original video clips into <strong>Apple ProRes 422 codec</strong> format that shortens the amount of time needed for rendering and provides excellent quality of color that is required for compositing. The <strong>proxy media files</strong> will also be created by transcoding the videos to <strong>Apple ProRes 422 codec format</strong> that retains original aspect ratio and frame rate of the video clips you transcoded. It is also worth noting that FCPX transcodes <strong>all mp3 files</strong> you import into a project to <strong>MOV audio files</strong>.</p>
<h4 id="4-Vegas-Pro"><a href="#4-Vegas-Pro" class="headerlink" title="4.

<p><strong>Compatibility:</strong> Windows</p>
<p>This video editor is often overlooked in conversations about the most powerful video editing apps, but the tools it offers are powerful enough to enable you to edit videos at a professional level. Creating proxy files in Vegas Pro is remarkably easy, as you just have to <strong>import the files</strong> into a new project, <strong>select each file</strong> you want to transcode and then choose the <strong>Create Video Proxy</strong> option from the right-click menu. Just keep in mind that you must create proxy files before you do any actual editing because otherwise, the transcoding process is not going work.</p>
<h4 id="5-Blender"><a href="#5-Blender" class="headerlink" title="5. Blender"></a>5. <a class="link"   target="_blank" rel="noopener" href="https://www.blender.org/" >Blender <i class="fa-regular fa-arrow-up-right-from-square fa-sm"></i></a></h4><p><strong>Price:</strong> Free</p>
<p><strong>Compatibility:</strong> Linux, macOS, Windows</p>
<p>Blender is a 3D modeling and VFX software that lets you track objects or use 3D painting tools among numerous other options. Even though creating proxies with this app is not a particularly complicated process, you still have to be familiar with Blender in order to make full use of its transcoding options. The software allows you to generate proxy files whose size is only <strong>25% of the video’s original size</strong>, although you can also create proxies that have <strong>50% and 75%</strong> of the video’s original size. After you’ve adjusted the transcoding settings you should simply click on the <strong>Rebuild Proxy and Timecode Indices</strong> button.</p>
<h4 id="6-Shotcut"><a href="#6-Shotcut" class="headerlink" title="6. Shotcut"></a>6. <a class="link"   target="_blank" rel="noopener" href="https://shotcut.org/" >Shotcut <i class="fa-regular fa-arrow-up-right-from-square fa-sm"></i></a></h4><p><strong>Price:</strong> Free</p>
<p><strong>Compatibility:</strong> Windows, macOS, Linux</p>
<p>Despite the fact that this cross-platform video editor <strong>supports 4K and ProRes files</strong> that can cause it to lag at times, creating proxies in Shotcut is a highly technical process. In case you decide to make a proxy file by yourself, you will have to <strong>export a version of the file that is two or four times smaller than the original</strong>. You must also remember that you have to go through the entire process of creating proxies before you make any edits. The trick to creating proxies in Shotcut is to <strong>make a project file with the larger version of the video, then replace the larger version of the file with a smaller version of that same video file</strong>, before you actually start editing. Once you’ve completed the editing process, you can then once again add the larger source file to the project and export your video in high resolution.</p>
<h4 id="7-Lightworks"><a href="#7-Lightworks" class="headerlink" title="7. Lightworks"></a>7. <a class="link"   target="_blank" rel="noopener" href="https://www.lwks.com/" >Lightworks <i class="fa-regular fa-arrow-up-right-from-square fa-sm"></i></a></h4><p><strong>Price:</strong> Free trial available, subscription plans start at $24,99 per month</p>
<p><strong>Compatibility:</strong> Linux, macOS, Windows</p>
<p>The process of creating proxies in Lightworks is rather simple since you just have to import the video files you’d like to edit into the software and make sure they are selected before you right-click on them. Once the right-click menu appears on the screen you should click on the <strong>Media submenu</strong> and select the <strong>Make Proxies</strong> option. The amount of time Lightworks is going to need to generate the proxy files depends on the number of the source files and their size. You can then proceed to add the proxies to the timeline, edit them and Lightworks will automatically use the source files instead of proxies during the rendering process.</p>
<h4 id="8-HitFilm-Express"><a href="#8-HitFilm-Express" class="headerlink" title="8. HitFilm Express"></a>8. <a class="link"   target="_blank" rel="noopener" href="https://fxhome.com/" >HitFilm Express <i class="fa-regular fa-arrow-up-right-from-square fa-sm"></i></a></h4><p><strong>Price:</strong> Free</p>
<p><strong>Compatibility:</strong> macOS, Windows</p>
<p>Once you create a new project and import all video clips you want to use in that project into the editor you should just go to the <strong>Assets menu</strong> that is located in <strong>the Media panel</strong> and click on the <strong>Make Proxy option</strong>. You will be able to continue editing while the transcoding process is still in progress, and after the source files are transcoded they will be replaced by proxies. However, making adjustments to a proxy version of a composite shot will invalidate that proxy file, which is why it is important to make all edits on that shot before you create its proxy.</p>
<p><strong>Conclusion</strong></p>
<p>Reducing the size of video clips you use in your projects is going to save you a lot of time during the video editing process. Each video editing software we featured in this article allows its users to generate proxy files effortlessly. Which video editor are you going to be using for proxy video editing?

<p>Shooting videos in high resolutions can help you create visually impressive content your followers on social media are going to adore. The only trouble is that the size of 4K videos can slow you down during the video editing process if your computer doesn’t have enough RAM memory or processing power. Additionally, quite a few inexpensive or free video editing apps don’t allow their users to create low-resolution proxy files that make the process of editing 4K videos much faster. That’s why in this article we are going to take you through the best 8 video editors you can use for 4K proxy video editing.</p>

However, even if you have a computer setup that can easily support processing of the 4K video files, proxy editing can still be useful as it can reduce the amount of time you will have to spend on performing complex video editing tasks. Let’s take a look at some of the best video editors that support proxy editing.</p>
<h4 id="1-Filmora-1"><a href="#1-Filmora-1" class="headerlink" title="1.

<p>The wide range of video editing options, support for nearly all popular video file formats or quick and simple exporting process are only a few reasons why Filmora is one of the best video editors you can use this year. Creating proxy files in Filmora is not a difficult task, because the software generates them automatically for you. You just have to choose between the <strong>1280x720p or 1920x1080p resolutions</strong> and Filmora will create proxies for all media files that are larger than the resolution you’ve selected. However, the amount of time Filmora is going to need to create proxies depends on your computer’s processing power, but also on the size and the number of the RAW files you imported into a project.</p>
<h4 id="2-Adobe-Premiere-Pro-CC-1"><a href="#2-Adobe-Premiere-Pro-CC-1" class="headerlink" title="2. Adobe Premiere Pro CC"></a>2. <a class="link"   target="_blank" rel="noopener" href="https://www.adobe.com/products/premiere.html" >Adobe Premiere Pro CC <i class="fa-regular fa-arrow-up-right-from-square fa-sm"></i></a></h4><p><strong>Price:</strong> $20,99 per month, different subscription plans available</p>
<p><strong>Compatibility:</strong> Windows, macOS</p>
<p>This is probably one of the best, if not the best non-linear video editing software ever created, so it is hardly surprising that you can easily create proxy files for all videos you use in a project you create in Adobe Premiere Pro. So, to create proxy files you just need to open the folder that contains those files from the <strong>Media Browser</strong> and then click on the <strong>Ingest button</strong>. You should then click on the <strong>wrench tool</strong> and pick the <strong>Create Proxies option</strong> from the drop-down menu located next to the <strong>Ingest option</strong>. Afterward, you should select one of the available resolution presets and proceed to import the footage into the project. However, before you can start editing with proxies you have to click on the <strong>Toggle Proxy button</strong>.</p>
<h4 id="3-Final-Cut-Pro-X-1"><a href="#3-Final-Cut-Pro-X-1" class="headerlink" title="3. Final Cut Pro X"></a>3. <a class="link"   target="_blank" rel="noopener" href="https://www.apple.com/lae/final-cut-pro/" >Final Cut Pro X <i class="fa-regular fa-arrow-up-right-from-square fa-sm"></i></a></h4><p><strong>Price:</strong> Free trial available, $299,99</p>
<p><strong>Compatibility:</strong> macOS</p>
<p>Transcoding media with FCPX doesn’t require too much effort, as the software offers a couple of options that make the editing process faster. You can opt to <strong>generate optimized media files</strong> by transcoding the original video clips into <strong>Apple ProRes 422 codec</strong> format that shortens the amount of time needed for rendering and provides excellent quality of color that is required for compositing. The <strong>proxy media files</strong> will also be created by transcoding the videos to <strong>Apple ProRes 422 codec format</strong> that retains original aspect ratio and frame rate of the video clips you transcoded. It is also worth noting that FCPX transcodes <strong>all mp3 files</strong> you import into a project to <strong>MOV audio files</strong>.</p>
<h4 id="4-Vegas-Pro-1"><a href="#4-Vegas-Pro-1" class="headerlink" title="4. Vegas Pro"></a>4. <a class="link"   target="_blank" rel="noopener" href="https://www.vegascreativesoftware.com/us/" >Vegas Pro <i class="fa-regular fa-arrow-up-right-from-square fa-sm"></i></a></h4><p><strong>Price:</strong> Subscription plans start from $249,00</p>
<p><strong>Compatibility:</strong> Windows</p>
<p>This video editor is often overlooked in conversations about the most powerful video editing apps, but the tools it offers are powerful enough to enable you to edit videos at a professional level. Creating proxy files in Vegas Pro is remarkably easy, as you just have to <strong>import the files</strong> into a new project, <strong>select each file</strong> you want to transcode and then choose the <strong>Create Video Proxy</strong> option from the right-click menu. Just keep in mind that you must create proxy files before you do any actual editing because otherwise, the transcoding process is not going work.</p>
<h4 id="5-Blender-1"><a href="#5-Blender-1" class="headerlink" title="5. Blender"></a>5. <a class="link"   target="_blank" rel="noopener" href="https://www.blender.org/" >Blender <i class="fa-regular fa-arrow-up-right-from-square fa-sm"></i></a></h4><p><strong>Price:</strong> Free</p>
<p><strong>Compatibility:</strong> Linux, macOS, Windows</p>
<p>Blender is a 3D modeling and VFX software that lets you track objects or use 3D painting tools among numerous other options. Even though creating proxies with this app is not a particularly complicated process, you still have to be familiar with Blender in order to make full use of its transcoding options. The software allows you to generate proxy files whose size is only <strong>25% of the video’s original size</strong>, although you can also create proxies that have <strong>50% and 75%</strong> of the video’s original size. After you’ve adjusted the transcoding settings you should simply click on the <strong>Rebuild Proxy and Timecode Indices</strong> button.</p>
<h4 id="6-Shotcut-1"><a href="#6-Shotcut-1" class="headerlink" title="6. Shotcut"></a>6. <a class="link"   target="_blank" rel="noopener" href="https://shotcut.org/" >Shotcut <i class="fa-regular fa-arrow-up-right-from-square fa-sm"></i></a></h4><p><strong>Price:</strong> Free</p>
<p><strong>Compatibility:</strong> Windows, macOS, Linux</p>
<p>Despite the fact that this cross-platform video editor <strong>supports 4K and ProRes files</strong> that can cause it to lag at times, creating proxies in Shotcut is a highly technical process. In case you decide to make a proxy file by yourself, you will have to <strong>export a version of the file that is two or four times smaller than the original</strong>. You must also remember that you have to go through the entire process of creating proxies before you make any edits. The trick to creating proxies in Shotcut is to <strong>make a project file with the larger version of the video, then replace the larger version of the file with a smaller version of that same video file</strong>, before you actually start editing. Once you’ve completed the editing process, you can then once again add the larger source file to the project and export your video in high resolution.</p>
<h4 id="7-Lightworks-1"><a href="#7-Lightworks-1" class="headerlink" title="7. Lightworks"></a>7. <a class="link"   target="_blank" rel="noopener" href="https://www.lwks.com/" >Lightworks <i class="fa-regular fa-arrow-up-right-from-square fa-sm"></i></a></h4><p><strong>Price:</strong> Free trial available, subscription plans start at $24,99 per month</p>
<p><strong>Compatibility:</strong> Linux, macOS, Windows</p>
<p>The process of creating proxies in Lightworks is rather simple since you just have to import the video files you’d like to edit into the software and make sure they are selected before you right-click on them. Once the right-click menu appears on the screen you should click on the <strong>Media submenu</strong> and select the <strong>Make Proxies</strong> option. The amount of time Lightworks is going to need to generate the proxy files depends on the number of the source files and their size. You can then proceed to add the proxies to the timeline, edit them and Lightworks will automatically use the source files instead of proxies during the rendering process.</p>
<h4 id="8-HitFilm-Express-1"><a href="#8-HitFilm-Express-1" class="headerlink" title="8. HitFilm Express"></a>8. <a class="link"   target="_blank" rel="noopener" href="https://fxhome.com/" >HitFilm Express <i class="fa-regular fa-arrow-up-right-from-square fa-sm"></i></a></h4><p><strong>Price:</strong> Free</p>
<p><strong>Compatibility:</strong> macOS, Windows</p>
<p>Once you create a new project and import all video clips you want to use in that project into the editor you should just go to the <strong>Assets menu</strong> that is located in <strong>the Media panel</strong> and click on the <strong>Make Proxy option</strong>. You will be able to continue editing while the transcoding process is still in progress, and after the source files are transcoded they will be replaced by proxies. However, making adjustments to a proxy version of a composite shot will invalidate that proxy file, which is why it is important to make all edits on that shot before you create its proxy.</p>
<p><strong>Conclusion</strong></p>
<p>Reducing the size of video clips you use in your projects is going to save you a lot of time during the video editing process. Each video editing software we featured in this article allows its users to generate proxy files effortlessly. Which video editor are you going to be using for proxy video editing?

However, the amount of time Filmora is going to need to create proxies depends on your computer’s processing power, but also on the size and the number of the RAW files you imported into a project.</p>

<p><strong>Compatibility:</strong> Windows, macOS</p>
<p>This is probably one of the best, if not the best non-linear video editing software ever created, so it is hardly surprising that you can easily create proxy files for all videos you use in a project you create in Adobe Premiere Pro. So, to create proxy files you just need to open the folder that contains those files from the <strong>Media Browser</strong> and then click on the <strong>Ingest button</strong>. You should then click on the <strong>wrench tool</strong> and pick the <strong>Create Proxies option</strong> from the drop-down menu located next to the <strong>Ingest option</strong>. Afterward, you should select one of the available resolution presets and proceed to import the footage into the project. However, before you can start editing with proxies you have to click on the <strong>Toggle Proxy button</strong>.</p>

<p><strong>Compatibility:</strong> macOS</p>
<p>Transcoding media with FCPX doesn’t require too much effort, as the software offers a couple of options that make the editing process faster. You can opt to <strong>generate optimized media files</strong> by transcoding the original video clips into <strong>Apple ProRes 422 codec</strong> format that shortens the amount of time needed for rendering and provides excellent quality of color that is required for compositing. The <strong>proxy media files</strong> will also be created by transcoding the videos to <strong>Apple ProRes 422 codec format</strong> that retains original aspect ratio and frame rate of the video clips you transcoded. It is also worth noting that FCPX transcodes <strong>all mp3 files</strong> you import into a project to <strong>MOV audio files</strong>.</p>

<p><strong>Compatibility:</strong> Windows</p>
<p>This video editor is often overlooked in conversations about the most powerful video editing apps, but the tools it offers are powerful enough to enable you to edit videos at a professional level. Creating proxy files in Vegas Pro is remarkably easy, as you just have to <strong>import the files</strong> into a new project, <strong>select each file</strong> you want to transcode and then choose the <strong>Create Video Proxy</strong> option from the right-click menu. Just keep in mind that you must create proxy files before you do any actual editing because otherwise, the transcoding process is not going work.</p>
<h4 id="5-Blender-3"><a href="#5-Blender-3" class="headerlink" title="5. Blender"></a>5. <a class="link"   target="_blank" rel="noopener" href="https://www.blender.org/" >Blender <i class="fa-regular fa-arrow-up-right-from-square fa-sm"></i></a></h4><p><strong>Price:</strong> Free</p>
<p><strong>Compatibility:</strong> Linux, macOS, Windows</p>
<p>Blender is a 3D modeling and VFX software that lets you track objects or use 3D painting tools among numerous other options. Even though creating proxies with this app is not a particularly complicated process, you still have to be familiar with Blender in order to make full use of its transcoding options. The software allows you to generate proxy files whose size is only <strong>25% of the video’s original size</strong>, although you can also create proxies that have <strong>50% and 75%</strong> of the video’s original size. After you’ve adjusted the transcoding settings you should simply click on the <strong>Rebuild Proxy and Timecode Indices</strong> button.</p>
<h4 id="6-Shotcut-3"><a href="#6-Shotcut-3" class="headerlink" title="6. Shotcut"></a>6. <a class="link"   target="_blank" rel="noopener" href="https://shotcut.org/" >Shotcut <i class="fa-regular fa-arrow-up-right-from-square fa-sm"></i></a></h4><p><strong>Price:</strong> Free</p>
<p><strong>Compatibility:</strong> Windows, macOS, Linux</p>
<p>Despite the fact that this cross-platform video editor <strong>supports 4K and ProRes files</strong> that can cause it to lag at times, creating proxies in Shotcut is a highly technical process. In case you decide to make a proxy file by yourself, you will have to <strong>export a version of the file that is two or four times smaller than the original</strong>. You must also remember that you have to go through the entire process of creating proxies before you make any edits. The trick to creating proxies in Shotcut is to <strong>make a project file with the larger version of the video, then replace the larger version of the file with a smaller version of that same video file</strong>, before you actually start editing. Once you’ve completed the editing process, you can then once again add the larger source file to the project and export your video in high resolution.</p>
<h4 id="7-Lightworks-3"><a href="#7-Lightworks-3" class="headerlink" title="7. Lightworks"></a>7. <a class="link"   target="_blank" rel="noopener" href="https://www.lwks.com/" >Lightworks <i class="fa-regular fa-arrow-up-right-from-square fa-sm"></i></a></h4><p><strong>Price:</strong> Free trial available, subscription plans start at $24,99 per month</p>
<p><strong>Compatibility:</strong> Linux, macOS, Windows</p>
<p>The process of creating proxies in Lightworks is rather simple since you just have to import the video files you’d like to edit into the software and make sure they are selected before you right-click on them. Once the right-click menu appears on the screen you should click on the <strong>Media submenu</strong> and select the <strong>Make Proxies</strong> option. The amount of time Lightworks is going to need to generate the proxy files depends on the number of the source files and their size. You can then proceed to add the proxies to the timeline, edit them and Lightworks will automatically use the source files instead of proxies during the rendering process.</p>
<h4 id="8-HitFilm-Express-3"><a href="#8-HitFilm-Express-3" class="headerlink" title="8. HitFilm Express"></a>8. <a class="link"   target="_blank" rel="noopener" href="https://fxhome.com/" >HitFilm Express <i class="fa-regular fa-arrow-up-right-from-square fa-sm"></i></a></h4><p><strong>Price:</strong> Free</p>
<p><strong>Compatibility:</strong> macOS, Windows</p>
<p>Once you create a new project and import all video clips you want to use in that project into the editor you should just go to the <strong>Assets menu</strong> that is located in <strong>the Media panel</strong> and click on the <strong>Make Proxy option</strong>. You will be able to continue editing while the transcoding process is still in progress, and after the source files are transcoded they will be replaced by proxies. However, making adjustments to a proxy version of a composite shot will invalidate that proxy file, which is why it is important to make all edits on that shot before you create its proxy.</p>
<p><strong>Conclusion</strong></p>
<p>Reducing the size of video clips you use in your projects is going to save you a lot of time during the video editing process. Each video editing software we featured in this article allows its users to generate proxy files effortlessly. Which video editor are you going to be using for proxy video editing?

<p>VSDC is one of the most popular freeware software among beginners and intermediate-level video editors. But it is limited only to Windows users. Even after multiple requests from the users and tech-critics, VSDC isn’t likely to release a VSDC Mac version soon. So, it is best to look for VSDC alternatives for Mac.</p>

<li>The timeline is simple yet powerful, and the customizable settings allow you to use the combination of mouse, keyboard, and icons controls and make the video-editing process seamless.</li>
</ul>
<p>So, it is not tough to discern why Filmora is considered as one of the most authoritative <a class="link"   target="_blank" rel="noopener" href="https://tools.techidaily.com/wondershare/filmora/download/" >video editor for Mac <i class="fa-regular fa-arrow-up-right-from-square fa-sm"></i></a> users. Moreover, as mentioned, the software is not absolutely free. Still, you can use most of its features in free version.</p>
<h2 id="Part-2-Top-3-VSDC-Video-Editor-for-Mac-Alternatives"><a href="#Part-2-Top-3-VSDC-Video-Editor-for-Mac-Alternatives" class="headerlink" title="Part 2: Top 3 VSDC Video Editor for Mac Alternatives"></a>Part 2: Top 3 VSDC Video Editor for Mac Alternatives</h2><p>After reviewing hundreds of freeware software, we have come up with the three best VSDC alternatives.</p>
<h3 id="1-ShotCut"><a href="#1-ShotCut" class="headerlink" title="1. ShotCut"></a>1. ShotCut</h3><p>A simple, free, and open-source software that makes the video-making process straightforward. Filled with interesting ideas and powerful features, the greatest thing about ShotCut is that besides being free — it is regularly updated and maintained by the vendor. The interface has a three-panel view and adding media files is as simple as dragging and dropping.</p>
<p>The software also includes rich features like keyframing, color correction, transition and lets you edit up to 4K resolution video with ease. But unlike VSDC, ShotCut does not have multiple preset transition effects and includes only 24 basic wipe-in or out effects. Still, the software has sophisticated features like Chroma Key and allows you to utilize third-party addons for text and titles as the application does not have many of them.</p>
<p><img  
                     lazyload
                     src="/images/loading.svg"
                     data-src="https://images.wondershare.com/filmora/article-images/vsdc-for-mac-1.png"
                      alt="shortcut"
                ></p>
<p><strong>Pros:</strong></p>
<ul>
<li>Lightweight for a sophisticated video-editor</li>
<li>The interface is simple and convenient and allows you to customize the toggles as per your preference</li>
<li>Numerous output options — supports major formats and offers you to export the footage in any format</li>
<li>Completely free platforms plus cross-platform support</li>
</ul>
<p><strong>Cons:</strong></p>
<ul>
<li>The app does not allow you to create layers automatically.</li>
<li>It could be tough for a newbie to work on ShotCut.</li>
<li>The application takes too long to show the applied effects; even simple transition effects suffer from latency.</li>
</ul>
<h3 id="2-OpenShot"><a href="#2-OpenShot" class="headerlink" title="2. OpenShot"></a>2. OpenShot</h3><p>Another free and open-source program, OpenShot, has the ability to give you high-quality output with minimal effort. The software includes all the basic functions like resizing, scaling, trimming, and audio mixing with real-time previews. Plus, it also incorporates features for animated-based keyframing and creating 2D animation with image sequencing.</p>
<p>Moreover, like the VSDC, there are also presets to give 3D effects like snowfall, text, and lens flares, and other effects to the video. Nonetheless, if you want to take these into your hand and need more flexibility over transition, effects, filters, and more then you will have to look elsewhere. Because although great, OpenShot does have gaps and excludes critical features, meaning if you want to give artistic effects and personalize the video as much as possible, OpenShot is not suitable for you.</p>
<p><img  
                     lazyload
                     src="/images/loading.svg"
                     data-src="https://images.wondershare.com/filmora/article-images/vsdc-for-mac-2.jpg"
                      alt="openshot"
                ></p>
<p><strong>Pros:</strong></p>
<ul>
<li>OpenShot user-friendly, intuitive interface enables users to utilize all the editing functions effortlessly.</li>
<li>The dedicated preview-video section allows you to view the edited video in real-time and see if everything is done perfectly or not.</li>
<li>Includes some basic 2D and 3D transition, plus it also includes filters and effects.</li>
<li>Audio equalizer lets you work on every aspect of the audio and tune the music finely.</li>
</ul>
<p><strong>Cons:</strong></p>
<ul>
<li>Many users have criticized the OpenShot video editor for lagging and crashing issues while editing high-resolution videos</li>
<li>Even after multiple requests from the users, OpenShot does not support GPU acceleration for encoding and decoding the video files.</li>
<li>Some critical features are missing.</li>
</ul>
<h3 id="3-Avidemux"><a href="#3-Avidemux" class="headerlink" title="3. Avidemux"></a>3. Avidemux</h3><p>Like VSDC, Avidemux is also a freeware that includes all the basic options to edit the video and is much suitable for beginner-level users. However, if you are intermediate or expert in video editing, Avidemux is not the one you need. The reason: Avidemux does have basic options like cutting, trimming, splitting, and more. Still, when it comes to sophisticated features like creative effects, transition, Avidemux does not have dedicated functions for that. Moreover, as usual for the video editors, the Timeline feature is also missing from the software.</p>
<p>Of course, in comparison to VSDC, Avidemux falls short. Because all it can do is the basic video editing, encoding, and de-noising. Other than that, it cannot boast about anything. Still, given the simple interface, Avidemux is perfect for newbies who do not have much experience with video editing. Be that as it may, if you are serious regarding video-editing, you should get a more powerful video editor on Mac.</p>
<p><img  
                     lazyload
                     src="/images/loading.svg"
                     data-src="https://images.wondershare.com/filmora/article-images/avidemux-for-mac-1.jpg"
                      alt="avidemux"
                ></p>
<p><strong>Pros:</strong></p>
<ul>
<li>The simple interface allows even the naivest users to use the application to the fullest</li>
<li>The application has all the basic video-editing features like cutting, splitting, trimming</li>
<li>Avidemux is excellent for encoding options; one of the industry’s finest, in fact.</li>
<li>Sharpening and de-noising filters to give fine details to the video</li>
</ul>
<p><strong>Cons:</strong></p>
<ul>
<li>Avidemux does not have advanced video-editing options like effects and transition</li>
<li>Lack the much important timeline feature</li>
</ul>
<h2 id="Part-3-Final-Words"><a href="#Part-3-Final-Words" class="headerlink" title="Part 3: Final Words"></a>Part 3: Final Words</h2><p>VSDC is a powerful and unique tool. The above-listed freeware like ShotCut, OpenShot, and Avidemux are good alternatives to it. But after reviewing several video editors — this is the closest we came to finding something similar to VSDC. And understanding that Mac users will need all the powerful functions that VSDC incorporates, Filmora for Mac that includes everything that VSDC has and more! The Filmora for Mac is also free to utilize, so you can simply download the software and edit videos like professionals.</p>

<h3 id="1-ShotCut-1"><a href="#1-ShotCut-1" class="headerlink" title="1. ShotCut"></a>1. ShotCut</h3><p>A simple, free, and open-source software that makes the video-making process straightforward. Filled with interesting ideas and powerful features, the greatest thing about ShotCut is that besides being free — it is regularly updated and maintained by the vendor. The interface has a three-panel view and adding media files is as simple as dragging and dropping.</p>
<p>The software also includes rich features like keyframing, color correction, transition and lets you edit up to 4K resolution video with ease. But unlike VSDC, ShotCut does not have multiple preset transition effects and includes only 24 basic wipe-in or out effects. Still, the software has sophisticated features like Chroma Key and allows you to utilize third-party addons for text and titles as the application does not have many of them.</p>

                ></p>
<p><strong>Pros:</strong></p>
<ul>
<li>Lightweight for a sophisticated video-editor</li>
<li>The interface is simple and convenient and allows you to customize the toggles as per your preference</li>
<li>Numerous output options — supports major formats and offers you to export the footage in any format</li>
<li>Completely free platforms plus cross-platform support</li>
</ul>
<p><strong>Cons:</strong></p>
<ul>
<li>The app does not allow you to create layers automatically.</li>
<li>It could be tough for a newbie to work on ShotCut.</li>
<li>The application takes too long to show the applied effects; even simple transition effects suffer from latency.</li>
</ul>
<h3 id="2-OpenShot-1"><a href="#2-OpenShot-1" class="headerlink" title="2. OpenShot"></a>2. OpenShot</h3><p>Another free and open-source program, OpenShot, has the ability to give you high-quality output with minimal effort. The software includes all the basic functions like resizing, scaling, trimming, and audio mixing with real-time previews. Plus, it also incorporates features for animated-based keyframing and creating 2D animation with image sequencing.</p>
<p>Moreover, like the VSDC, there are also presets to give 3D effects like snowfall, text, and lens flares, and other effects to the video. Nonetheless, if you want to take these into your hand and need more flexibility over transition, effects, filters, and more then you will have to look elsewhere. Because although great, OpenShot does have gaps and excludes critical features, meaning if you want to give artistic effects and personalize the video as much as possible, OpenShot is not suitable for you.</p>

<p><strong>Pros:</strong></p>
<ul>
<li>OpenShot user-friendly, intuitive interface enables users to utilize all the editing functions effortlessly.</li>
<li>The dedicated preview-video section allows you to view the edited video in real-time and see if everything is done perfectly or not.</li>
<li>Includes some basic 2D and 3D transition, plus it also includes filters and effects.</li>
<li>Audio equalizer lets you work on every aspect of the audio and tune the music finely.</li>
</ul>
<p><strong>Cons:</strong></p>
<ul>
<li>Many users have criticized the OpenShot video editor for lagging and crashing issues while editing high-resolution videos</li>
<li>Even after multiple requests from the users, OpenShot does not support GPU acceleration for encoding and decoding the video files.</li>
<li>Some critical features are missing.</li>
</ul>
<h3 id="3-Avidemux-1"><a href="#3-Avidemux-1" class="headerlink" title="3. Avidemux"></a>3. Avidemux</h3><p>Like VSDC, Avidemux is also a freeware that includes all the basic options to edit the video and is much suitable for beginner-level users. However, if you are intermediate or expert in video editing, Avidemux is not the one you need. The reason: Avidemux does have basic options like cutting, trimming, splitting, and more. Still, when it comes to sophisticated features like creative effects, transition, Avidemux does not have dedicated functions for that. Moreover, as usual for the video editors, the Timeline feature is also missing from the software.</p>
<p>Of course, in comparison to VSDC, Avidemux falls short. Because all it can do is the basic video editing, encoding, and de-noising. Other than that, it cannot boast about anything. Still, given the simple interface, Avidemux is perfect for newbies who do not have much experience with video editing. Be that as it may, if you are serious regarding video-editing, you should get a more powerful video editor on Mac.</p>

<ul>
<li>Starting with the simple interface that includes an array of features to distinguish as a sophisticated video editing tool for Mac.</li>

<li>The timeline is simple yet powerful, and the customizable settings allow you to use the combination of mouse, keyboard, and icons controls and make the video-editing process seamless.</li>
</ul>
<p>So, it is not tough to discern why Filmora is considered as one of the most authoritative <a class="link"   target="_blank" rel="noopener" href="https://tools.techidaily.com/wondershare/filmora/download/" >video editor for Mac <i class="fa-regular fa-arrow-up-right-from-square fa-sm"></i></a> users. Moreover, as mentioned, the software is not absolutely free. Still, you can use most of its features in free version.</p>
<h2 id="Part-2-Top-3-VSDC-Video-Editor-for-Mac-Alternatives-3"><a href="#Part-2-Top-3-VSDC-Video-Editor-for-Mac-Alternatives-3" class="headerlink" title="Part 2: Top 3 VSDC Video Editor for Mac Alternatives"></a>Part 2: Top 3 VSDC Video Editor for Mac Alternatives</h2><p>After reviewing hundreds of freeware software, we have come up with the three best VSDC alternatives.</p>
<h3 id="1-ShotCut-3"><a href="#1-ShotCut-3" class="headerlink" title="1. ShotCut"></a>1. ShotCut</h3><p>A simple, free, and open-source software that makes the video-making process straightforward. Filled with interesting ideas and powerful features, the greatest thing about ShotCut is that besides being free — it is regularly updated and maintained by the vendor. The interface has a three-panel view and adding media files is as simple as dragging and dropping.</p>
<p>The software also includes rich features like keyframing, color correction, transition and lets you edit up to 4K resolution video with ease. But unlike VSDC, ShotCut does not have multiple preset transition effects and includes only 24 basic wipe-in or out effects. Still, the software has sophisticated features like Chroma Key and allows you to utilize third-party addons for text and titles as the application does not have many of them.</p>
<p><img  
                     lazyload
                     src="/images/loading.svg"
                     data-src="https://images.wondershare.com/filmora/article-images/vsdc-for-mac-1.png"
                      alt="shortcut"
                ></p>
<p><strong>Pros:</strong></p>
<ul>
<li>Lightweight for a sophisticated video-editor</li>
<li>The interface is simple and convenient and allows you to customize the toggles as per your preference</li>
<li>Numerous output options — supports major formats and offers you to export the footage in any format</li>
<li>Completely free platforms plus cross-platform support</li>
</ul>
<p><strong>Cons:</strong></p>
<ul>
<li>The app does not allow you to create layers automatically.</li>
<li>It could be tough for a newbie to work on ShotCut.</li>
<li>The application takes too long to show the applied effects; even simple transition effects suffer from latency.</li>
</ul>
<h3 id="2-OpenShot-3"><a href="#2-OpenShot-3" class="headerlink" title="2. OpenShot"></a>2. OpenShot</h3><p>Another free and open-source program, OpenShot, has the ability to give you high-quality output with minimal effort. The software includes all the basic functions like resizing, scaling, trimming, and audio mixing with real-time previews. Plus, it also incorporates features for animated-based keyframing and creating 2D animation with image sequencing.</p>
<p>Moreover, like the VSDC, there are also presets to give 3D effects like snowfall, text, and lens flares, and other effects to the video. Nonetheless, if you want to take these into your hand and need more flexibility over transition, effects, filters, and more then you will have to look elsewhere. Because although great, OpenShot does have gaps and excludes critical features, meaning if you want to give artistic effects and personalize the video as much as possible, OpenShot is not suitable for you.</p>
<p><img  
                     lazyload
                     src="/images/loading.svg"
                     data-src="https://images.wondershare.com/filmora/article-images/vsdc-for-mac-2.jpg"
                      alt="openshot"
                ></p>
<p><strong>Pros:</strong></p>
<ul>
<li>OpenShot user-friendly, intuitive interface enables users to utilize all the editing functions effortlessly.</li>
<li>The dedicated preview-video section allows you to view the edited video in real-time and see if everything is done perfectly or not.</li>
<li>Includes some basic 2D and 3D transition, plus it also includes filters and effects.</li>
<li>Audio equalizer lets you work on every aspect of the audio and tune the music finely.</li>
</ul>
<p><strong>Cons:</strong></p>
<ul>
<li>Many users have criticized the OpenShot video editor for lagging and crashing issues while editing high-resolution videos</li>
<li>Even after multiple requests from the users, OpenShot does not support GPU acceleration for encoding and decoding the video files.</li>
<li>Some critical features are missing.</li>
</ul>
<h3 id="3-Avidemux-3"><a href="#3-Avidemux-3" class="headerlink" title="3. Avidemux"></a>3. Avidemux</h3><p>Like VSDC, Avidemux is also a freeware that includes all the basic options to edit the video and is much suitable for beginner-level users. However, if you are intermediate or expert in video editing, Avidemux is not the one you need. The reason: Avidemux does have basic options like cutting, trimming, splitting, and more. Still, when it comes to sophisticated features like creative effects, transition, Avidemux does not have dedicated functions for that. Moreover, as usual for the video editors, the Timeline feature is also missing from the software.</p>
<p>Of course, in comparison to VSDC, Avidemux falls short. Because all it can do is the basic video editing, encoding, and de-noising. Other than that, it cannot boast about anything. Still, given the simple interface, Avidemux is perfect for newbies who do not have much experience with video editing. Be that as it may, if you are serious regarding video-editing, you should get a more powerful video editor on Mac.</p>
<p><img  
                     lazyload
                     src="/images/loading.svg"
                     data-src="https://images.wondershare.com/filmora/article-images/avidemux-for-mac-1.jpg"
                      alt="avidemux"
                ></p>
<p><strong>Pros:</strong></p>
<ul>
<li>The simple interface allows even the naivest users to use the application to the fullest</li>
<li>The application has all the basic video-editing features like cutting, splitting, trimming</li>
<li>Avidemux is excellent for encoding options; one of the industry’s finest, in fact.</li>
<li>Sharpening and de-noising filters to give fine details to the video</li>
</ul>
<p><strong>Cons:</strong></p>
<ul>
<li>Avidemux does not have advanced video-editing options like effects and transition</li>
<li>Lack the much important timeline feature</li>
</ul>
<h2 id="Part-3-Final-Words-3"><a href="#Part-3-Final-Words-3" class="headerlink" title="Part 3: Final Words"></a>Part 3: Final Words</h2><p>VSDC is a powerful and unique tool. The above-listed freeware like ShotCut, OpenShot, and Avidemux are good alternatives to it. But after reviewing several video editors — this is the closest we came to finding something similar to VSDC. And understanding that Mac users will need all the powerful functions that VSDC incorporates, Filmora for Mac that includes everything that VSDC has and more! The Filmora for Mac is also free to utilize, so you can simply download the software and edit videos like professionals.</p>

The platform has various tools that provide you with different ways to make engaging lyric videos. Below are the summarized steps of creating a professional lyric video in Wondershare Filmora video editor.</p>
<p><strong>Step 1: Add and edit music in the timeline</strong></p>
<p>Since we are going to make a lyric video, let’s import the audio track to the timeline first, add the fade-in or fade-out effect to make it smoother if needed.</p>
<p><img  
                     lazyload
                     src="/images/loading.svg"
                     data-src="https://images.wondershare.com/filmora/article-images/add-music-to-filmora-timeline.jpg"
                      alt="Add music to Filmora Timeline"
                ></p>
<p><strong>Step</strong> <strong>2: Choose Sample Color background</strong></p>
<p>After launching Filmora, go to the Sample Color category under the Media tab, and you will find many sample colors to choose from. Drag and drop one into the timeline.</p>
<p><img  
                     lazyload
                     src="/images/loading.svg"
                     data-src="https://images.wondershare.com/filmora/article-images/filmora-sample-color-library.jpg"
                      alt=" Filmora sample color library"
                ></p>
<p><strong>Step 3:</strong> <strong>Add and customize texts to the lyric video</strong></p>
<p>Filmora video editor offers a wide variety of pre-written content and lets the creators drag and drop to see how it looks, with no need for editing or other typical copywriting tasks. Go to the Titles tab, drag the desired text over to the sample color video track. Here, we prefer to use a default title</p>
<p><img  
                     lazyload
                     src="/images/loading.svg"
                     data-src="https://images.wondershare.com/filmora/article-images/customize-lyric-titles-filmora.jpg"
                      alt=" Filmora customize lyrics"
                ></p>
<p>Double click the titles in the timeline to customize the texts, fonts, colors, or animations. Click the Advanced button for a new window pops up where you can add a title box and do more customization. Such as giving the titles individual animation.</p>
<p><strong>Step 4: Add effects for texts</strong></p>
<p><img  
                     lazyload
                     src="/images/loading.svg"
                     data-src="https://images.wondershare.com/filmora/article-images/add-mild-effects-to-lyric-video.jpg"
                      alt=" add mile effects to  lyrics"
                ></p>
<p>To make the whole title dynamic, we can add some effects to the texts. Go to the Effects tab and then click on mild effects to put the mild effects to the text. Right-click the Mild effect and go to Properties to change its frequency and positions if needed.</p>
<p> <strong>Step</strong> <strong>5: Add</strong> <strong>transitions to texts</strong></p>
<p>Filmora video editor provides lots of transitions for playing the video smoother. Go to the Transitions tab and choose one and place it between each title to make the lyric video vivid.</p>
<p><img  
                     lazyload
                     src="/images/loading.svg"

<p><strong>Fonts</strong></p>
<p>A lyric video is all about fonts because the viewers are interested in reading the lyrics. So, you should select interesting fonts and should focus on font style, size, and color. The fonts should sync in with the video’s vibe so that the viewer can enjoy watching it.</p>
<p><strong>Transitions&#x2F;Filters</strong></p>

<p>You should pick an attractive theme for creating an engaging video. No doubt, a video having a central theme attracts the viewers a lot.</p>
<p><strong>Color</strong></p>
<p>You should select an efficient and eye-catching color scheme for your lyric video. That is because it is helpful in elevating the visual appeal of the video, which in turn gains the attention of the viewers.</p>
<p><strong>Fonts</strong></p>
<p>A lyric video is all about fonts because the viewers are interested in reading the lyrics. So, you should select interesting fonts and should focus on font style, size, and color. The fonts should sync in with the video’s vibe so that the viewer can enjoy watching it.</p>
<p><strong>Transitions&#x2F;Filters</strong></p>
<p>You should use filters that could blend with the song’s vibe. Choose the transitions that look natural and appealing. Never bombard your video with too many transitions and filters.</p>

You can enjoy listening to the music and reading the exact lyrics of the song by viewing a lyric video. You should know that a lyric video is totally different from a karaoke video. The professionals can create creative and engaging lyric videos to grab the attention of their viewers</p>
<p>You can follow these tips to make good lyric videos:</p>
<p><strong>Accuracy</strong></p>
<p>You should make sure that there is 100% accuracy in the lyric video you are creating. If there are wrong lyrics on any of your lyric videos, your followers may not prefer watching your other lyric videos. So, double-check or triple-check the lyrics before sharing them with your fans.</p>
<p><strong>Theme&#x2F;Background</strong></p>
<p>You should pick an attractive theme for creating an engaging video. No doubt, a video having a central theme attracts the viewers a lot.</p>
<p><strong>Color</strong></p>
<p>You should select an efficient and eye-catching color scheme for your lyric video. That is because it is helpful in elevating the visual appeal of the video, which in turn gains the attention of the viewers.</p>
<p><strong>Fonts</strong></p>
<p>A lyric video is all about fonts because the viewers are interested in reading the lyrics. So, you should select interesting fonts and should focus on font style, size, and color. The fonts should sync in with the video’s vibe so that the viewer can enjoy watching it.</p>
<p><strong>Transitions&#x2F;Filters</strong></p>
<p>You should use filters that could blend with the song’s vibe. Choose the transitions that look natural and appealing. Never bombard your video with too many transitions and filters.</p>

Below are the summarized steps of creating a professional lyric video in Wondershare Filmora video editor.</p>
<p><strong>Step 1: Add and edit music in the timeline</strong></p>
<p>Since we are going to make a lyric video, let’s import the audio track to the timeline first, add the fade-in or fade-out effect to make it smoother if needed.</p>
<p><img  
                     lazyload
                     src="/images/loading.svg"
                     data-src="https://images.wondershare.com/filmora/article-images/add-music-to-filmora-timeline.jpg"
                      alt="Add music to Filmora Timeline"
                ></p>
<p><strong>Step</strong> <strong>2: Choose Sample Color background</strong></p>
<p>After launching Filmora, go to the Sample Color category under the Media tab, and you will find many sample colors to choose from. Drag and drop one into the timeline.</p>
<p><img  
                     lazyload
                     src="/images/loading.svg"
                     data-src="https://images.wondershare.com/filmora/article-images/filmora-sample-color-library.jpg"
                      alt=" Filmora sample color library"
                ></p>
<p><strong>Step 3:</strong> <strong>Add and customize texts to the lyric video</strong></p>
<p>Filmora video editor offers a wide variety of pre-written content and lets the creators drag and drop to see how it looks, with no need for editing or other typical copywriting tasks. Go to the Titles tab, drag the desired text over to the sample color video track. Here, we prefer to use a default title</p>
<p><img  
                     lazyload
                     src="/images/loading.svg"
                     data-src="https://images.wondershare.com/filmora/article-images/customize-lyric-titles-filmora.jpg"
                      alt=" Filmora customize lyrics"
                ></p>
<p>Double click the titles in the timeline to customize the texts, fonts, colors, or animations. Click the Advanced button for a new window pops up where you can add a title box and do more customization. Such as giving the titles individual animation.</p>
<p><strong>Step 4: Add effects for texts</strong></p>
<p><img  
                     lazyload
                     src="/images/loading.svg"
                     data-src="https://images.wondershare.com/filmora/article-images/add-mild-effects-to-lyric-video.jpg"
                      alt=" add mile effects to  lyrics"
                ></p>
<p>To make the whole title dynamic, we can add some effects to the texts. Go to the Effects tab and then click on mild effects to put the mild effects to the text. Right-click the Mild effect and go to Properties to change its frequency and positions if needed.</p>
<p> <strong>Step</strong> <strong>5: Add</strong> <strong>transitions to texts</strong></p>
<p>Filmora video editor provides lots of transitions for playing the video smoother. Go to the Transitions tab and choose one and place it between each title to make the lyric video vivid.</p>
<p><img  
                     lazyload
                     src="/images/loading.svg"
                     data-src="https://images.wondershare.com/filmora/article-images/add-transitions-to-lyric-video.jpg"
