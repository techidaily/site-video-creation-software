### List of top 5 HD movie players:

**[1\. 5KPlayer - In-class HD movie player (Support 4K, H.265)](https://tools.techidaily.com/5kplayer/video-music-player/)** 
**[2\. Cyberlink PowerDVD](https://tools.techidaily.com/5kplayer/video-music-player/)** 
**[3\. Ace Player HD - Torrent support available](https://tools.techidaily.com/5kplayer/video-music-player/)** 
**[4\. Cyberlink PowerDVD](https://tools.techidaily.com/5kplayer/video-music-player/)** 
**[5\. AllPlayer HD](https://tools.techidaily.com/5kplayer/video-music-player/)** 

**NO. 2 VLC Media Player: HD Movie Player with Improved UI**

![No. 2 HD Movie Player - VLC](https://www.5kplayer.com/video-music-player/img/vlc-for-android.jpg)

Just like 5KPlayer, VLC for Windows 10 handles mainstream HD/FHD movie codecs like H.264/H.265, and WebM unimpeded. Yet for media file management, this HD movie player isn't as intuitive as 5KPlayer due to the lack of a "play list mode", but it's just as convenient if you want to add subtitles to the movies.

Old versions of VLC interface running on Windows 7/8 have been regarded as outdated. Recently this HD player developer made an overhaul for VLC for Windows 10 UI - much better-looking â€“ however, just like other Windows Store APPs, stability issues remain ostentatious, with VLC not playing DVD and [VLC audio delay errors](https://tools.techidaily.com/5kplayer/video-music-player/) jumping out quite often.

**NO. 3 Ace Player HD: HD Movie Player with Torrent Support**

Now that bit torrent websites remain an effective (yet not advisable method) to get 1080p UHD/Full HD movies/content, there are a good amount of [torrent players](https://tools.techidaily.com/5kplayer/video-music-player/) out there, and Ace Player HD is one of them with HD support.

Despite its good popularity, watching 1080p HD movies with Ace Player HD may somewhat infringe the HD movie content copyright. But the advantage is just attractive - playing HD movie torrent without downloading the whole lot of videos really saves you disk space.  
But stability is poor, with Softonic also referring to it as "less stable" - and that - for an HD movie player with backdoors to movie torrent, this is not hard to imagine.

**NO. 4 PowerDVD: Dual-Functional for both HD Movies and DVD Format**

![NO.5 PowerDVD - HD Movie Player](https://www.5kplayer.com/video-music-player/img/powerdvd-mp-408.jpg)
