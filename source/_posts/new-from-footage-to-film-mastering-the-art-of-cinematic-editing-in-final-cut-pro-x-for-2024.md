Do you enjoy the view of movies? Do you find your videos dull and unexciting? How about giving a cinematic look to your videos?

I bet a lot of editors have been there. However, it won’t take you long to find out that movies are quite different from the video you recorded and edited.

No worries, this article explains why there are differences between self-made videos and movies, as well as simple yet detailed steps to make cinematic look videos with FCPX.

## **Part 1: Difference between a Cinematic Look and a Normal Video?**

The term cinematic is often referred to the black bars or wide-screen frame ratios. Photographers and filmmakers use the term cinematic to describe the look of movies and pictures shot on film.

However, the term has changed its meaning with the advent of digital video and the invention of high-tech devices. With the evolution of the internet across the globe, YouTubers, videographers, and social media influencers have started using this term to describe anything related to cinema and film. In other words, a cinematic look is an unconventional, film-look, and professional appearance of a video that makes a normal clip look elegant and worth watching. [See the top 10 movies made by FCPX here.](https://tools.techidaily.com/wondershare/filmora/download/)

![Blade-Runner-2049-poster](https://images.wondershare.com/filmora/images/final-cut-pro/Blade-Runner-2049-poster.png)

So, here we draw a line between a normal video and the one with a cinematic look. In the latter, you adjust everything that is directly or indirectly linked to the quality of a video, including but not limited to **colors**, **appearance**, **light**, **motion**, **frame rate**, **composition**, and **camera** **movements**.

Resolution refers to the horizontal pixel count such as 2K (2.2 megapixels) or 4K (8.8 megapixels). Similarly, the frame rate defines the number of individual images or frames being displayed on the TV screen per second. The universally accepted film frame rate is 24 FPS, which is used to make high-definition videos. However, most TV broadcasts and shows are recorded at 30fps. [See more about FPS here](https://tools.techidaily.com/wondershare/filmora/download/).

Thanks to the advanced video editing tools and applications that have made it easier to capture a cinematic look or make HD cinematic look videos with basic camera setups. If you want to get your desired cinematic look, read the following section.

## Part 2: How to Make a Cinematic Look Film Video with FCPX?

The latest features and user-friendly dashboard of Final Cut Pro X allow users (even beginners) to add effects and increase the aesthetics of their videos. Follow these four simple steps to make a cinematic look high-resolution video with Final Cut Pro X.

**Step 1: 4K Resolution and Low Frame Rate**

To achieve ideal cinematic aesthetics, you need high-quality 4K resolution videos, awesome exposure, the right codec, and lighting. Hence, to start with, capture a high-quality 4K Canon RAW shot with the latest high-tech Canon Log 2 camera. You can also use other devices and choose different codecs and color profiles to get the best color grade.

![frame-rate](https://images.wondershare.com/filmora/images/final-cut-pro/frame-rate.png)

**Step 2: Color Grading and Color Correction**

After importing your footage, get ready for color corrections to address issues like conversions for LOG formats through white balance adjustments. Color corrections normalize the color of HD videos into a standard format. Here’s how you can do this:

1. Go to the Inspector Panel and select the Extended Function
2. Select the C-Log 2 conversion LUT

![color-grading](https://images.wondershare.com/filmora/images/final-cut-pro/color-grading.png)

1. Make minor exposure and white balance adjustments as per your scope
2. Select the Color Wheels and Color Mask features to custom select specific areas and colors
3. Adjust your color grade according to your requirements
4. Use Color Masking to improve the shadow’s appearance and warm-up mid-tones
5. You will get a strong color contrast in your footage.

**Step 3: Use Slow Motion at the Right Timing**

Final Cut Pro X allows its users to make both constant and variable speed changes without disturbing the audio’s pitch. By using slow-motion effects at the right timing, you can make your videos adorable and give them a cinematic look.

* Select your video and click on the Retiming button
* Tap on the Slow section

![slow-motion](https://images.wondershare.com/filmora/images/final-cut-pro/slow-motion.png)

* You will see multiple options to slow down the speed of your clip
* The smaller number will slow down your footage
* To apply custom retiming amounts, again click on the Retiming button and select the Custom option
* Custom the speed of your clip over 100% or less than 100% as you want
* After selecting a value, your selected clip will become longer on the timeline.

**Step 4: Adopt Film Grain to Make Film-look Videos**

Film grain overlays give your videos vintage and cinematic look. Follow these steps to use these film grains in Final Cut Pro X:

1. Import your footage and film grains downloaded from the internet and layer them into your timeline
2. Place the film grain on top of your clip
3. Select the clip and go to the FCPX blend mode dropdown menu located on the top-right of your screen
4. Click on the Overlay and adjust the opacity of the film grain overlay as required.

## **Part 3: What Other Factors Contribute to Film-Look Videos**

While making cinematic-look videos, also considering the following factors:

**Framing**

While filming, one must be aware of the emotion to be captured in the frame. For this purpose, follow the “Rule of Thirds,” which means to divide your short into three horizontal and vertical sections and select the third shot to produce some effect.

**Tilt Shift**

Instead of shooting your clips with a UHD camera, you can add cinematic effect with the Tilt-shift feature by setting the focus of your video. For this purpose, right-click on the video, select Power Tool and check the box with the option Apply Tilt-shift to the clip. Use the slider to adjust the focus.

**Background Music**

Cinematic clips without background music seem to be unexciting and boring. Adding melodious background music makes your videos look more professional and enjoyable. You can add default music or your favorite music downloaded from the internet by clicking on the Music tab.

**Titles and Subtitles**

Adding subtitles to your videos can make them understandable for viewers who speak a different language. Click on Text/Credit in Filmora and select Subtitles to add subtitles to your video.

## **Part 4: How to Add Cinematic Look to Your Footage in Easy Ways**

Filmora is an advanced video editing tool developed by Wondershare. Its user-friendly and easy-to-understand interface makes it popular among beginners as well as professionals. And the best thing about Filmora is that the editor provides rich options of presets, effects, and filters to add a film look to your video.

Here’s how you can add a cinematic look to your footage with Filmora.

1. Go to the Inspector Panel and select the Extended Function
2. Select the C-Log 2 conversion LUT

3. Adjust your color grade according to your requirements
4. Use Color Masking to improve the shadow’s appearance and warm-up mid-tones
5. You will get a strong color contrast in your footage.

**Step 3: Use Slow Motion at the Right Timing**

* Custom the speed of your clip over 100% or less than 100% as you want
* After selecting a value, your selected clip will become longer on the timeline.

**Step 4: Adopt Film Grain to Make Film-look Videos**

2. Place the film grain on top of your clip
3. Select the clip and go to the FCPX blend mode dropdown menu located on the top-right of your screen

## **Part 3: What Other Factors Contribute to Film-Look Videos**

While making cinematic-look videos, also considering the following factors:

**Framing**

While filming, one must be aware of the emotion to be captured in the frame. For this purpose, follow the “Rule of Thirds,” which means to divide your short into three horizontal and vertical sections and select the third shot to produce some effect.

**Tilt Shift**

Instead of shooting your clips with a UHD camera, you can add cinematic effect with the Tilt-shift feature by setting the focus of your video. For this purpose, right-click on the video, select Power Tool and check the box with the option Apply Tilt-shift to the clip. Use the slider to adjust the focus.

**Background Music**

Cinematic clips without background music seem to be unexciting and boring. Adding melodious background music makes your videos look more professional and enjoyable. You can add default music or your favorite music downloaded from the internet by clicking on the Music tab.

**Titles and Subtitles**

Adding subtitles to your videos can make them understandable for viewers who speak a different language. Click on Text/Credit in Filmora and select Subtitles to add subtitles to your video.

## **Part 4: How to Add Cinematic Look to Your Footage in Easy Ways**

Filmora is an advanced video editing tool developed by Wondershare. Its user-friendly and easy-to-understand interface makes it popular among beginners as well as professionals. And the best thing about Filmora is that the editor provides rich options of presets, effects, and filters to add a film look to your video.

## Best Time-Lapse Apps for Android and iPhone Devices in 2021

The quality of your time-lapse video doesn’t depend only on the number of tools an app offers, which is why you must do everything in your power to record the footage that doesn’t contain camera shakes or any other common mistakes. With that being said, let’s take a look at the five best time-lapse apps you can find on GooglePlay or on the AppStore.

## Unbiased Comparison: Sony Vegas vs Adobe Premiere Pro for Video Creators

# Sony Vegas VS Adobe Premiere, Which One is Better?

##### Ollie Mattison

 Mar 27, 2024• Proven solutions

It's an age-old battle, [Vegas](https://www.vegascreativesoftware.com/us/) or [Premiere](https://www.adobe.com/products/premiere.html), a comparison that many have made over the last few years in the market, as always when making a comparison, things are always skewed by the writer's own views, so it is hard to draw any definitive conclusions. Here we aim to lay out the specifications of each product and discuss their effects on workflow, output, and usability to form an opinion beyond the 'this is the one I like' argument. However, we are aware of making a completely fair comparison is impossible. We will try our best. Hope you will enjoy it!

Again the [Premiere spec-sheet suggests it is a close call](https://helpx.adobe.com/premiere-pro/system-requirements.html), and to be brutally honest that is mostly the truth. Premiere does have more ability within the editing department there is no question. There are very few things that Vegas does better (3D manipulation being the standout), but distilled into the bare bones of a list of 'things', so the differences are not so obvious. The usability factor for Vegas carries on into the editing process too, although it is perhaps inevitable that Premiere's more complex abilities lead to a more complex interface structure and a steeper learning curve, it is still a truth that Vegas is just easier to get results from at the start.

Underneath the [Vegas specifications](https://www.vegascreativesoftware.com/us/vegas-pro/specifications/) though, Premiere does have plenty going for it, the Mercury Playback Engine that drives the editing suite enables renders real-time playback that saves time and makes for a much smoother workflow for any project, and whilst it will not apply to everyone, the multiple camera abilities are second to none and for those that use them, an invaluable and significant tool for producing professional-grade output.

I keep returning to this point, but in a comparison of the two products it is a very important one, whilst ultimately Premiere has more ability within it for producing high-quality video, it is the learning curve that is [the major difference for new users](https://www.udemy.com/). This should be a consideration for anyone looking at the two, however, the complexity of Premiere is not an insurmountable issue. There are numerous tutorials, both free and commercial, available to get any level of the user through the first steps of understanding the processes within Premiere, and of course the same is true of Vegas, although to my mind they would not be as essentially an item, whereas with Premiere, the very least that is required is going through Adobe's own online video education for the software.

#### 2. Sony Vegas VS Adobe Premiere: Specification Comparison

As we can see at first glance the two seem very comparable regarding the basic tools and utilities. The one glaring difference does not mentioned in the basic specs outlined above, however, is that Sony Vegas is a Windows-only product. [Premiere has versions for both Mac and Windows](https://www.premierebro.com/blog/adobe-announces-windows-and-mac-os-support-changes-for-future-releases), and whilst the dominance of Apple within the creative industries is nowhere near what it once was, a sizable number of people still use the Mac platform, and for them, Vegas isn't even an option without resorting to emulation, which is a processor-intensive operation like video editing is not really a viable solution.

It is also important to consider that the spec-sheet itself doesn't tell the whole story, with the audio and [effect modules more advanced in Premiere](https://helpx.adobe.com/after-effects/using/effects-animation-presets-overview.html), however, Vegas has the benefit of being a much easier program to get to grips with for anyone new to the video editing world, and although its abilities are perhaps ultimately not as sophisticated as Premiere, new users often find they get better results with Vegas due to the accessibility of its tools. For the more experienced this is probably not a factor, but it is worth considering for newcomers.

#### 3. Sony Vegas VS Adobe Premiere: Workflow comparison

Once that initial barrier is overcome, however, I feel that the added functionality, workflow efficiency, and compatibility-out-of-the-box Premiere can deal with roughly double the number of [media formats](https://helpx.adobe.com/fi/premiere-pro/using/supported-file-formats.html) \- of Adobe's product makes it a superior product for long-term use.

The key here is long term, no one wants to relearn everything every couple of years, switching platforms endlessly searching for the ultimate product, so when making a choice for video editing I would always suggest that prospective users consider not just what they want now, but what they may want in the future. Vegas has the easier entry path, there is absolutely no question, however what if you later want the more sophisticated editing facilities? If you switch then you still have to go through learning Premiere, after learning Vegas. Learning one piece of software is a better choice, so which one will fulfill future needs should be taken into account.

#### 4. Sony Vegas VS Adobe Premiere: Compatibility Comparison

There is also the issue of other production requirements. If you are aiming towards motion effects, animation, and other composite effects within your work, then consider the platform that will be carried out on as well. Here is where Adobe's strength shines. The various products they put out work together extremely well, and [in the case of video effects](https://tools.techidaily.com/wondershare/filmora/download/), Premiere and After Effects together offer a workflow and output quality that is as good as it gets. Saying either will do the job is not really a satisfactory conclusion for these types of comparisons, even if it is actually true. However, there are answers here.

## Part 2: FAQ about Vegas

### 1\. Can Sony Vegas be used on a Mac?

Sony Vegas professional was not generally a SONY item, and it is not, at this point, a SONY item.

It was offered to Magix before this previous year. It was initially a DAW [Digital Audio Workstation](https://tools.techidaily.com/wondershare/filmora/download/) programming that had video highlights. After some time, it developed into the item a considerable lot of us know and love, Vegas Pro.

A hearty and expert video altering programming! SONY hoped to port Vegas over to Mac for quite a while. They had effectively discharged a Mac form of SoundForge, and Vegas would have been straightaway.

I surmise they ran into a huge amount of specialized issues, the greatest being that they just needed Mac programming abilities.

Apple additionally discharged FCPX as a $299 altering application for Mac, which removed any gainfulness from the condition for SONY. So that answers why Sony Vegas on Mac is impossible.

### 2\. Is there a Sony Vegas for free?

No, you do not get a Sony Vegas on Mac completely free at any time. However, there is a way in which you can torrent it or go for a free trial version.

Despite the option, the better suggestion for you is to go and purchase it instead of downloading it from anywhere else. It is because choosing the second option may lead to leakage of data from your computer.

Otherwise, you can also use alternative software such as Hitfilm Express or Lightworks. So, now you know that the Sony Vegas ‘Pro’ is just a faux term because there is no difference between the professional and normal version.

Both come at a premium cost anyway.

### 3\. How much does Sony Vegas cost?

There are [different plans of the Sony Vegas](https://tools.techidaily.com/wondershare/filmora/download/) such as Vegas Pro Edit, Vegas Pro, Vegas Pro 365, Vegas Pro Suite. The Vegas Pro Edit generally costs around $698\. Next, The Vegas Pro comes at the cost of $898\. The popular Vegas Pro 365 is priced at $16.67 for every 3 months.

So, you need to pay a total of $66.68 annually. Lastly, the Sony Vegas Pro Suite comes at $1098 and is the costliest of all the versions.

## Conclusion

In conclusion, Premiere is the more capable program, both in terms of workflow, output, and its ability to integrate with other applications to produce much more advanced output. For anyone looking for more than just an editor, it is the choice to make. Find some instructional material, dive in, and have fun.

Again the [Premiere spec-sheet suggests it is a close call](https://helpx.adobe.com/premiere-pro/system-requirements.html), and to be brutally honest that is mostly the truth. Premiere does have more ability within the editing department there is no question. There are very few things that Vegas does better (3D manipulation being the standout), but distilled into the bare bones of a list of 'things', so the differences are not so obvious. The usability factor for Vegas carries on into the editing process too, although it is perhaps inevitable that Premiere's more complex abilities lead to a more complex interface structure and a steeper learning curve, it is still a truth that Vegas is just easier to get results from at the start.

Underneath the [Vegas specifications](https://www.vegascreativesoftware.com/us/vegas-pro/specifications/) though, Premiere does have plenty going for it, the Mercury Playback Engine that drives the editing suite enables renders real-time playback that saves time and makes for a much smoother workflow for any project, and whilst it will not apply to everyone, the multiple camera abilities are second to none and for those that use them, an invaluable and significant tool for producing professional-grade output.

I keep returning to this point, but in a comparison of the two products it is a very important one, whilst ultimately Premiere has more ability within it for producing high-quality video, it is the learning curve that is [the major difference for new users](https://www.udemy.com/).

## Part 2: FAQ about Vegas

### 1\. Can Sony Vegas be used on a Mac?

Sony Vegas professional was not generally a SONY item, and it is not, at this point, a SONY item.

It was offered to Magix before this previous year. It was initially a DAW [Digital Audio Workstation](https://tools.techidaily.com/wondershare/filmora/download/) programming that had video highlights. After some time, it developed into the item a considerable lot of us know and love, Vegas Pro.

A hearty and expert video altering programming! SONY hoped to port Vegas over to Mac for quite a while. They had effectively discharged a Mac form of SoundForge, and Vegas would have been straightaway.

I surmise they ran into a huge amount of specialized issues, the greatest being that they just needed Mac programming abilities.

Apple additionally discharged FCPX as a $299 altering application for Mac, which removed any gainfulness from the condition for SONY. So that answers why Sony Vegas on Mac is impossible.

### 2\. Is there a Sony Vegas for free?

No, you do not get a Sony Vegas on Mac completely free at any time. However, there is a way in which you can torrent it or go for a free trial version.

Despite the option, the better suggestion for you is to go and purchase it instead of downloading it from anywhere else. It is because choosing the second option may lead to leakage of data from your computer.

Otherwise, you can also use alternative software such as Hitfilm Express or Lightworks. So, now you know that the Sony Vegas ‘Pro’ is just a faux term because there is no difference between the professional and normal version.

Both come at a premium cost anyway.

### 3\. How much does Sony Vegas cost?

There are [different plans of the Sony Vegas](https://tools.techidaily.com/wondershare/filmora/download/) such as Vegas Pro Edit, Vegas Pro, Vegas Pro 365, Vegas Pro Suite. The Vegas Pro Edit generally costs around $698\. Next, The Vegas Pro comes at the cost of $898\. The popular Vegas Pro 365 is priced at $16.67 for every 3 months.

So, you need to pay a total of $66.68 annually. Lastly, the Sony Vegas Pro Suite comes at $1098 and is the costliest of all the versions.

It's an age-old battle, [Vegas](https://www.vegascreativesoftware.com/us/) or [Premiere](https://www.adobe.com/products/premiere.html), a comparison that many have made over the last few years in the market, as always when making a comparison, things are always skewed by the writer's own views, so it is hard to draw any definitive conclusions. Here we aim to lay out the specifications of each product and discuss their effects on workflow, output, and usability to form an opinion beyond the 'this is the one I like' argument. However, we are aware of making a completely fair comparison is impossible. We will try our best. Hope you will enjoy it!

Again the [Premiere spec-sheet suggests it is a close call](https://helpx.adobe.com/premiere-pro/system-requirements.html), and to be brutally honest that is mostly the truth. Premiere does have more ability within the editing department there is no question. There are very few things that Vegas does better (3D manipulation being the standout), but distilled into the bare bones of a list of 'things', so the differences are not so obvious. The usability factor for Vegas carries on into the editing process too, although it is perhaps inevitable that Premiere's more complex abilities lead to a more complex interface structure and a steeper learning curve, it is still a truth that Vegas is just easier to get results from at the start.

Underneath the [Vegas specifications](https://www.vegascreativesoftware.com/us/vegas-pro/specifications/) though, Premiere does have plenty going for it, the Mercury Playback Engine that drives the editing suite enables renders real-time playback that saves time and makes for a much smoother workflow for any project, and whilst it will not apply to everyone, the multiple camera abilities are second to none and for those that use them, an invaluable and significant tool for producing professional-grade output.

I keep returning to this point, but in a comparison of the two products it is a very important one, whilst ultimately Premiere has more ability within it for producing high-quality video, it is the learning curve that is [the major difference for new users](https://www.udemy.com/). This should be a consideration for anyone looking at the two, however, the complexity of Premiere is not an insurmountable issue. There are numerous tutorials, both free and commercial, available to get any level of the user through the first steps of understanding the processes within Premiere, and of course the same is true of Vegas, although to my mind they would not be as essentially an item, whereas with Premiere, the very least that is required is going through Adobe's own online video education for the software.

#### 2. Sony Vegas VS Adobe Premiere: Specification Comparison

As we can see at first glance the two seem very comparable regarding the basic tools and utilities. The one glaring difference does not mentioned in the basic specs outlined above, however, is that Sony Vegas is a Windows-only product. [Premiere has versions for both Mac and Windows](https://www.premierebro.com/blog/adobe-announces-windows-and-mac-os-support-changes-for-future-releases), and whilst the dominance of Apple within the creative industries is nowhere near what it once was, a sizable number of people still use the Mac platform, and for them, Vegas isn't even an option without resorting to emulation, which is a processor-intensive operation like video editing is not really a viable solution.

It is also important to consider that the spec-sheet itself doesn't tell the whole story, with the audio and [effect modules more advanced in Premiere](https://helpx.adobe.com/after-effects/using/effects-animation-presets-overview.html), however, Vegas has the benefit of being a much easier program to get to grips with for anyone new to the video editing world, and although its abilities are perhaps ultimately not as sophisticated as Premiere, new users often find they get better results with Vegas due to the accessibility of its tools. For the more experienced this is probably not a factor, but it is worth considering for newcomers.

#### 3. Sony Vegas VS Adobe Premiere: Workflow comparison

Once that initial barrier is overcome, however, I feel that the added functionality, workflow efficiency, and compatibility-out-of-the-box Premiere can deal with roughly double the number of [media formats](https://helpx.adobe.com/fi/premiere-pro/using/supported-file-formats.html) \- of Adobe's product makes it a superior product for long-term use.

The key here is long term, no one wants to relearn everything every couple of years, switching platforms endlessly searching for the ultimate product, so when making a choice for video editing I would always suggest that prospective users consider not just what they want now, but what they may want in the future. Vegas has the easier entry path, there is absolutely no question, however what if you later want the more sophisticated editing facilities? If you switch then you still have to go through learning Premiere, after learning Vegas. Learning one piece of software is a better choice, so which one will fulfill future needs should be taken into account.

#### 4. Sony Vegas VS Adobe Premiere: Compatibility Comparison

There is also the issue of other production requirements. If you are aiming towards motion effects, animation, and other composite effects within your work, then consider the platform that will be carried out on as well. Here is where Adobe's strength shines. The various products they put out work together extremely well, and [in the case of video effects](https://tools.techidaily.com/wondershare/filmora/download/), Premiere and After Effects together offer a workflow and output quality that is as good as it gets. Saying either will do the job is not really a satisfactory conclusion for these types of comparisons, even if it is actually true. However, there are answers here.
