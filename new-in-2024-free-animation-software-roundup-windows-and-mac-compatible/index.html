<p><strong>Pro</strong>: Ideal for designing simple 3D animations and models.</p>
<p><strong>Con</strong>: It has an old-fashioned interface. Also, the built-render (RenderMan) feature is difficult to use by beginners.</p>
<p>K-3D is an animation and 3D modeling software. You can download this tool for free on your Mac. Besides, you can also install and run it on your Windows and Linux systems. If you look at the design, you will find that the software is quite old. But don’t judge a book by its cover. Why so? It is because K-3D is one of the strongest and most versatile tools for 3D artists with many options.</p>
<p>For example, K-3D offers extremely systematic and methodological workflows. You can easily adjust the properties of the features in real-time and get instant results. It has a node-oriented visualization pipeline to enjoy more freedom. That means you can create animation using a variety of combinations.</p>
<p>One of the best things about K-3D is that it has three subdivisions of animation. You can work on your model on one side while showing the other side in a mirrored form. Then, experience the final result combined together. And in case you need to make the changes to the end results, you can simply work on the first subdivision and savor automatic changes to the results.</p>
<p>K-3D has an advanced redo and undo mechanism to ensure you can go back or move forward to make corrections or amendments without limits. Additionally, the tool is developed keeping in mind all the industrial standards. For instance, it has complete support and integration of native RenderMan™ to its user interface. This is an excellent feature because most free animation software for Mac requires third-party render plugins.</p>
<p><strong>Features:</strong></p>
<ul>
<li>Parametric workflow.</li>
<li>2D and 3D animation tools.</li>
<li>Allows Python and K3DScript scripting.</li>
</ul>

<p><strong>Pro</strong>: Advanced tools with numerous animation options and online training material.</p>
<p><strong>Con</strong>: Not suitable for beginners.</p>
<p>If you love 2D animation, then you’ll surely love Krita. It is entirely free software available on Mac, Windows, and Linux. Also, it offers a full platform for drawing and frame-by-frame animation.</p>
<p>The number one reason for adoring Krita is its brush library. There are more than 100 professional brushes to give you a wide range of effects. Moreover, the strokes are pretty amazing and similar to Adobe Photoshop or Adobe Illustrator.</p>
<p>Another great thing about Krita is the brush stabilization feature designed for shaky hands. You can add a stabilizer to your chosen brush to smoothen its flow. Besides, there’s a special Dynamic Brush tool to make animation more fun. At the same time, you can also customize your brushes through different brush engines, including filter engines, color smudge engines, and many more.</p>
<p>Apart from the basic brush options, the preloaded vector tools are next to admire. These tools help you make great comic panels. All you need to do is choose and drag the word bubble template on your canvas. Then, make changes with the anchor point to make new shapes. At the same time, you can also add text to your animation by using the text tool.</p>
<p>Last but not least, there’s a wrap-around mode to create seamless patterns and textures. That means the image or drawing makes its own references along the x-axis and y-axis. This gives you the freedom to continue painting and enjoy updates to your animation instantly.</p>
<p><strong>Features:</strong></p>
<ul>
<li>HDR painting.</li>
<li>PSD support.</li>
<li>Python scripting.</li>
<li>Selection and transformation tools.</li>
<li>Proper group, filter, vector, and file layer management.</li>
<li>Complete color management for extraordinary results.</li>
<li>Drawing assistant to help you with straight lines and vanishing points.</li>

<p><strong>Pro</strong>: Ideal for designing simple 3D animations and models.</p>
<p><strong>Con</strong>: It has an old-fashioned interface. Also, the built-render (RenderMan) feature is difficult to use by beginners.</p>
<p>K-3D is an animation and 3D modeling software. You can download this tool for free on your Mac. Besides, you can also install and run it on your Windows and Linux systems. If you look at the design, you will find that the software is quite old. But don’t judge a book by its cover. Why so? It is because K-3D is one of the strongest and most versatile tools for 3D artists with many options.</p>
<p>For example, K-3D offers extremely systematic and methodological workflows. You can easily adjust the properties of the features in real-time and get instant results. It has a node-oriented visualization pipeline to enjoy more freedom. That means you can create animation using a variety of combinations.</p>
<p>One of the best things about K-3D is that it has three subdivisions of animation. You can work on your model on one side while showing the other side in a mirrored form. Then, experience the final result combined together. And in case you need to make the changes to the end results, you can simply work on the first subdivision and savor automatic changes to the results.</p>
<p>K-3D has an advanced redo and undo mechanism to ensure you can go back or move forward to make corrections or amendments without limits. Additionally, the tool is developed keeping in mind all the industrial standards. For instance, it has complete support and integration of native RenderMan™ to its user interface. This is an excellent feature because most free animation software for Mac requires third-party render plugins.</p>
<p><strong>Features:</strong></p>
<ul>
<li>Parametric workflow.</li>
<li>2D and 3D animation tools.</li>
<li>Allows Python and K3DScript scripting.</li>
</ul>

<p><strong>Pro</strong>: Advanced tools with numerous animation options and online training material.</p>
<p><strong>Con</strong>: Not suitable for beginners.</p>
<p>If you love 2D animation, then you’ll surely love Krita. It is entirely free software available on Mac, Windows, and Linux. Also, it offers a full platform for drawing and frame-by-frame animation.</p>
<p>The number one reason for adoring Krita is its brush library. There are more than 100 professional brushes to give you a wide range of effects. Moreover, the strokes are pretty amazing and similar to Adobe Photoshop or Adobe Illustrator.</p>
<p>Another great thing about Krita is the brush stabilization feature designed for shaky hands. You can add a stabilizer to your chosen brush to smoothen its flow. Besides, there’s a special Dynamic Brush tool to make animation more fun. At the same time, you can also customize your brushes through different brush engines, including filter engines, color smudge engines, and many more.</p>
<p>Apart from the basic brush options, the preloaded vector tools are next to admire. These tools help you make great comic panels. All you need to do is choose and drag the word bubble template on your canvas. Then, make changes with the anchor point to make new shapes. At the same time, you can also add text to your animation by using the text tool.</p>
<p>Last but not least, there’s a wrap-around mode to create seamless patterns and textures. That means the image or drawing makes its own references along the x-axis and y-axis. This gives you the freedom to continue painting and enjoy updates to your animation instantly.</p>
<p><strong>Features:</strong></p>
<ul>
<li>HDR painting.</li>
<li>PSD support.</li>
<li>Python scripting.</li>
<li>Selection and transformation tools.</li>
<li>Proper group, filter, vector, and file layer management.</li>

<p><strong>Pro</strong>: Ideal for designing simple 3D animations and models.</p>
<p><strong>Con</strong>: It has an old-fashioned interface. Also, the built-render (RenderMan) feature is difficult to use by beginners.</p>
<p>K-3D is an animation and 3D modeling software. You can download this tool for free on your Mac. Besides, you can also install and run it on your Windows and Linux systems. If you look at the design, you will find that the software is quite old. But don’t judge a book by its cover. Why so? It is because K-3D is one of the strongest and most versatile tools for 3D artists with many options.</p>
<p>For example, K-3D offers extremely systematic and methodological workflows. You can easily adjust the properties of the features in real-time and get instant results. It has a node-oriented visualization pipeline to enjoy more freedom. That means you can create animation using a variety of combinations.</p>
<p>One of the best things about K-3D is that it has three subdivisions of animation. You can work on your model on one side while showing the other side in a mirrored form. Then, experience the final result combined together. And in case you need to make the changes to the end results, you can simply work on the first subdivision and savor automatic changes to the results.</p>
<p>K-3D has an advanced redo and undo mechanism to ensure you can go back or move forward to make corrections or amendments without limits. Additionally, the tool is developed keeping in mind all the industrial standards. For instance, it has complete support and integration of native RenderMan™ to its user interface. This is an excellent feature because most free animation software for Mac requires third-party render plugins.</p>
<p><strong>Features:</strong></p>
<ul>
<li>Parametric workflow.</li>
<li>2D and 3D animation tools.</li>
<li>Allows Python and K3DScript scripting.</li>
</ul>

<p><strong>Pro</strong>: Advanced tools with numerous animation options and online training material.</p>
<p><strong>Con</strong>: Not suitable for beginners.</p>
<p>If you love 2D animation, then you’ll surely love Krita. It is entirely free software available on Mac, Windows, and Linux. Also, it offers a full platform for drawing and frame-by-frame animation.</p>
<p>The number one reason for adoring Krita is its brush library. There are more than 100 professional brushes to give you a wide range of effects. Moreover, the strokes are pretty amazing and similar to Adobe Photoshop or Adobe Illustrator.</p>
<p>Another great thing about Krita is the brush stabilization feature designed for shaky hands. You can add a stabilizer to your chosen brush to smoothen its flow. Besides, there’s a special Dynamic Brush tool to make animation more fun. At the same time, you can also customize your brushes through different brush engines, including filter engines, color smudge engines, and many more.</p>
<p>Apart from the basic brush options, the preloaded vector tools are next to admire. These tools help you make great comic panels. All you need to do is choose and drag the word bubble template on your canvas. Then, make changes with the anchor point to make new shapes. At the same time, you can also add text to your animation by using the text tool.</p>
<p>Last but not least, there’s a wrap-around mode to create seamless patterns and textures. That means the image or drawing makes its own references along the x-axis and y-axis. This gives you the freedom to continue painting and enjoy updates to your animation instantly.</p>
<p><strong>Features:</strong></p>
<ul>
<li>HDR painting.</li>
<li>PSD support.</li>
<li>Python scripting.</li>
<li>Selection and transformation tools.</li>
<li>Proper group, filter, vector, and file layer management.</li>
<li>Complete color management for extraordinary results.</li>

<p><strong>Pro</strong>: Ideal for designing simple 3D animations and models.</p>
<p><strong>Con</strong>: It has an old-fashioned interface. Also, the built-render (RenderMan) feature is difficult to use by beginners.</p>
<p>K-3D is an animation and 3D modeling software. You can download this tool for free on your Mac. Besides, you can also install and run it on your Windows and Linux systems. If you look at the design, you will find that the software is quite old. But don’t judge a book by its cover. Why so? It is because K-3D is one of the strongest and most versatile tools for 3D artists with many options.</p>
<p>For example, K-3D offers extremely systematic and methodological workflows. You can easily adjust the properties of the features in real-time and get instant results. It has a node-oriented visualization pipeline to enjoy more freedom. That means you can create animation using a variety of combinations.</p>
<p>One of the best things about K-3D is that it has three subdivisions of animation. You can work on your model on one side while showing the other side in a mirrored form. Then, experience the final result combined together. And in case you need to make the changes to the end results, you can simply work on the first subdivision and savor automatic changes to the results.</p>
<p>K-3D has an advanced redo and undo mechanism to ensure you can go back or move forward to make corrections or amendments without limits. Additionally, the tool is developed keeping in mind all the industrial standards. For instance, it has complete support and integration of native RenderMan™ to its user interface. This is an excellent feature because most free animation software for Mac requires third-party render plugins.</p>
<p><strong>Features:</strong></p>
<ul>
<li>Parametric workflow.</li>
<li>2D and 3D animation tools.</li>
<li>Allows Python and K3DScript scripting.</li>
</ul>

<p><strong>Pro</strong>: Advanced tools with numerous animation options and online training material.</p>
<p><strong>Con</strong>: Not suitable for beginners.</p>
<p>If you love 2D animation, then you’ll surely love Krita. It is entirely free software available on Mac, Windows, and Linux. Also, it offers a full platform for drawing and frame-by-frame animation.</p>
<p>The number one reason for adoring Krita is its brush library. There are more than 100 professional brushes to give you a wide range of effects. Moreover, the strokes are pretty amazing and similar to Adobe Photoshop or Adobe Illustrator.</p>
<p>Another great thing about Krita is the brush stabilization feature designed for shaky hands. You can add a stabilizer to your chosen brush to smoothen its flow. Besides, there’s a special Dynamic Brush tool to make animation more fun. At the same time, you can also customize your brushes through different brush engines, including filter engines, color smudge engines, and many more.</p>
<p>Apart from the basic brush options, the preloaded vector tools are next to admire. These tools help you make great comic panels. All you need to do is choose and drag the word bubble template on your canvas. Then, make changes with the anchor point to make new shapes. At the same time, you can also add text to your animation by using the text tool.</p>
<p>Last but not least, there’s a wrap-around mode to create seamless patterns and textures. That means the image or drawing makes its own references along the x-axis and y-axis. This gives you the freedom to continue painting and enjoy updates to your animation instantly.</p>
<p><strong>Features:</strong></p>
<ul>
<li>HDR painting.</li>
<li>PSD support.</li>
<li>Python scripting.</li>
<li>Selection and transformation tools.</li>
<li>Proper group, filter, vector, and file layer management.</li>

<p>Generally, for the same price, you will be able to get a better build quality, longger battery life and lighter Chromebook, compared to Mac and PC. However, it is a common knowledge that Chromebooks don’t support Windows or Mac video applications or any other apps that aren’t designed for the Chrome OS. But, if you are looking for a way to edit your videos from a Chromebook do not despair because there is a way to use Windows or Mac software. Instead of being forced to use online editors that often provide just a few basic editing options Chromebook users can access editing software that is compatible with Mac or Windows OS. There is more than just one way to gain access to Mac and Windows programs, although before getting your hopes up, you should first check if the Chromebook model you have allows you to install the necessary software.</p>
<p>These solutions may not be obvious, but using them may enable you to use professional editing software that is available for Mac and Windows operating systems. Let’s see how you can run Filmora, Final Cut Pro, Sony Vegas Pro or any other powerful video editing software from your Chromebook.</p>

Let’s have a look at the methods that will enable you to gain access to all applications you need to create stunning videos.</p>
<h4 id="Method-1-Accessing-with-Chromebook-Desktop-Remote"><a href="#Method-1-Accessing-with-Chromebook-Desktop-Remote" class="headerlink" title="Method 1: Accessing with Chromebook Desktop Remote"></a>Method 1: Accessing with Chromebook Desktop Remote</h4><p>A simple app that is available at the Google Play Store for free will enable you to access a remote computer and use any programs installed on it from your Chromebook. There are many applications similar to Chrome Desktop Remote, but we chose it because it is simple to use, very effective and completely free.</p>
<h4 id="1-Install-Chromebook-Desktop-Remote"><a href="#1-Install-Chromebook-Desktop-Remote" class="headerlink" title="1.Install Chromebook Desktop Remote"></a>1.Install Chromebook Desktop Remote</h4><p>The first step is to install the Chrome Desktop Remote app on both the computers you want to pair with and your Chromebook. After the application is installed, you will be presented with two options in the app’s main screen Remote Assistance and My Computers.</p>
<p><img  
                     lazyload
                     src="/images/loading.svg"

                      alt="chromebook-remote-desktop"
                ></p>
<p>Choose the My Computers option, then click on Get Started button and select the Enable Remote Connections feature. Once you’ve completed these actions, accept to install the Chrome Desktop Remote Host Installer and after the installation is over, run the installer.</p>
<h4 id="2-Choose-PIN"><a href="#2-Choose-PIN" class="headerlink" title="2.Choose PIN"></a>2.Choose PIN</h4><p>In the next step, you will be asked to select the security PIN for the host computer, that must be numeric and that has at least six digits. After you successfully completed this task the part of the process related to the host computer is finished, although you may want to adjust power saving settings so it doesn’t go into a standby mode if it is inactive for too long.</p>

                ></p>
<h4 id="3-Make-Connection"><a href="#3-Make-Connection" class="headerlink" title="3.Make Connection"></a>3.Make Connection</h4><p>In order to establish the connection between your PC and your Chromebook, both devices must sign into the same Google account. Go to the Google Play Store, only this time from you Chromebook and click on the Launch app option, the app should already be installed on the Chromebook you are using as a consequence of Google accounts keeping in sync. After you launched the app go to My Computers option and choose the Get Started feature. Select the computer you’d like to connect to and insert the PIN. After you entered the PIN, click on the Connect option and you should be able to see the desktop of your computer in the web browser.</p>

                ></p>
<h4 id="4-Optimize-Options"><a href="#4-Optimize-Options" class="headerlink" title="4.Optimize Options"></a>4.Optimize Options</h4><p>Due to disparities between screen resolutions, pictures you will be able to see on your Chromebook may appear to be a little grainy. If you’d like to have a sharper and clearer image go to Options and disable Shrink to Fit feature. Furthermore, users who’d like to use video editing apps must make sure that all content they would like to edit is either on the Googe Drive because the Chrome Desktop Remote doesn’t offer a direct transfer of files as an option.</p>
<h4 id="Method-2-Using-Developer-Mode-and-Installing-a-Virtual-Machine"><a href="#Method-2-Using-Developer-Mode-and-Installing-a-Virtual-Machine" class="headerlink" title="Method 2: Using Developer Mode and Installing a Virtual Machine"></a>Method 2: Using Developer Mode and Installing a Virtual Machine</h4><p>The second method is best suited for Chromebook owners who are already running a Linux OS on their devices. The Developer Mode can provide a powerful Linux desktop on Chrombook, although it is a slightly complicated process that can be time-consuming. Before install a Virtual Machine software on Chromebook, you should check if your Chromebook is ARM or Intel based, because Virtual Machine software can’t run on ARM powered Chromebooks.</p>
<ul>
<li>The first step of the process is to install the Linux OS from the Developer Mode on your Chromebook, then switch to the newly installed OS and start the installation of the Virtual Machine software like Virtual Box or Windows Virtual PC.</li>
<li>The next step is to install the Windows OS inside the Virtual Box or any other Virtual Machine software you decided to use. This will enable you to switch between Chrome OS and Linux OS with a simple keyboard shortcut or use editing software that is compatible with the Windows OS.</li>
</ul>
<p><img  
                     lazyload

                      alt="chromebook-virtual-machine"
                ></p>
<ul>
<li>After you’ve successfully installed the Windows OS within the Virtual Machine software you can install video editing software that will allow you to edit videos from your Chromebook. The Virtual Machine software takes a lot of hard-drive space so that may not leave too much space for the video footage you’d like to edit with your Chromebook. Even the latest Chromebooks offer barely enough processing power required to run more demanding editing software, so using the software like the Virtual Box may limit their performance even more.</li>
</ul>
<p>Chromebook owners who would like to have access to Mac and Windows video editing apps will benefit more if they choose to install the Chromebook Desktop Remote application because it is easier to use and it has performed much better than all other methods of accessing software designed for Mac, Windows or Linux operating systems.</p>

<p>Generally, for the same price, you will be able to get a better build quality, longger battery life and lighter Chromebook, compared to Mac and PC. However, it is a common knowledge that Chromebooks don’t support Windows or Mac video applications or any other apps that aren’t designed for the Chrome OS. But, if you are looking for a way to edit your videos from a Chromebook do not despair because there is a way to use Windows or Mac software. Instead of being forced to use online editors that often provide just a few basic editing options Chromebook users can access editing software that is compatible with Mac or Windows OS. There is more than just one way to gain access to Mac and Windows programs, although before getting your hopes up, you should first check if the Chromebook model you have allows you to install the necessary software.</p>
<p>These solutions may not be obvious, but using them may enable you to use professional editing software that is available for Mac and Windows operating systems. Let’s see how you can run Filmora, Final Cut Pro, Sony Vegas Pro or any other powerful video editing software from your Chromebook.</p>

Let’s have a look at the methods that will enable you to gain access to all applications you need to create stunning videos.</p>
<h4 id="Method-1-Accessing-with-Chromebook-Desktop-Remote-2"><a href="#Method-1-Accessing-with-Chromebook-Desktop-Remote-2" class="headerlink" title="Method 1: Accessing with Chromebook Desktop Remote"></a>Method 1: Accessing with Chromebook Desktop Remote</h4><p>A simple app that is available at the Google Play Store for free will enable you to access a remote computer and use any programs installed on it from your Chromebook. There are many applications similar to Chrome Desktop Remote, but we chose it because it is simple to use, very effective and completely free.</p>
<h4 id="1-Install-Chromebook-Desktop-Remote-2"><a href="#1-Install-Chromebook-Desktop-Remote-2" class="headerlink" title="1.Install Chromebook Desktop Remote"></a>1.Install Chromebook Desktop Remote</h4><p>The first step is to install the Chrome Desktop Remote app on both the computers you want to pair with and your Chromebook. After the application is installed, you will be presented with two options in the app’s main screen Remote Assistance and My Computers.</p>
<p><img  
                     lazyload
                     src="/images/loading.svg"

                      alt="chromebook-remote-desktop"
                ></p>
<p>Choose the My Computers option, then click on Get Started button and select the Enable Remote Connections feature. Once you’ve completed these actions, accept to install the Chrome Desktop Remote Host Installer and after the installation is over, run the installer.</p>
<h4 id="2-Choose-PIN-2"><a href="#2-Choose-PIN-2" class="headerlink" title="2.Choose PIN"></a>2.Choose PIN</h4><p>In the next step, you will be asked to select the security PIN for the host computer, that must be numeric and that has at least six digits. After you successfully completed this task the part of the process related to the host computer is finished, although you may want to adjust power saving settings so it doesn’t go into a standby mode if it is inactive for too long.</p>
<p><img

<h4 id="3-Make-Connection-2"><a href="#3-Make-Connection-2" class="headerlink" title="3.Make Connection"></a>3.Make Connection</h4><p>In order to establish the connection between your PC and your Chromebook, both devices must sign into the same Google account. Go to the Google Play Store, only this time from you Chromebook and click on the Launch app option, the app should already be installed on the Chromebook you are using as a consequence of Google accounts keeping in sync. After you launched the app go to My Computers option and choose the Get Started feature. Select the computer you’d like to connect to and insert the PIN. After you entered the PIN, click on the Connect option and you should be able to see the desktop of your computer in the web browser.</p>
<p><img

<h4 id="4-Optimize-Options-2"><a href="#4-Optimize-Options-2" class="headerlink" title="4.Optimize Options"></a>4.Optimize Options</h4><p>Due to disparities between screen resolutions, pictures you will be able to see on your Chromebook may appear to be a little grainy. If you’d like to have a sharper and clearer image go to Options and disable Shrink to Fit feature. Furthermore, users who’d like to use video editing apps must make sure that all content they would like to edit is either on the Googe Drive because the Chrome Desktop Remote doesn’t offer a direct transfer of files as an option.</p>
<h4 id="Method-2-Using-Developer-Mode-and-Installing-a-Virtual-Machine-2"><a href="#Method-2-Using-Developer-Mode-and-Installing-a-Virtual-Machine-2" class="headerlink" title="Method 2: Using Developer Mode and Installing a Virtual Machine"></a>Method 2: Using Developer Mode and Installing a Virtual Machine</h4><p>The second method is best suited for Chromebook owners who are already running a Linux OS on their devices. The Developer Mode can provide a powerful Linux desktop on Chrombook, although it is a slightly complicated process that can be time-consuming. Before install a Virtual Machine software on Chromebook, you should check if your Chromebook is ARM or Intel based, because Virtual Machine software can’t run on ARM powered Chromebooks.</p>
<ul>
<li>The first step of the process is to install the Linux OS from the Developer Mode on your Chromebook, then switch to the newly installed OS and start the installation of the Virtual Machine software like Virtual Box or Windows Virtual PC.</li>
<li>The next step is to install the Windows OS inside the Virtual Box or any other Virtual Machine software you decided to use. This will enable you to switch between Chrome OS and Linux OS with a simple keyboard shortcut or use editing software that is compatible with the Windows OS.</li>
</ul>
<p><img  
                     lazyload

                      alt="chromebook-virtual-machine"
                ></p>
<ul>
<li>After you’ve successfully installed the Windows OS within the Virtual Machine software you can install video editing software that will allow you to edit videos from your Chromebook. The Virtual Machine software takes a lot of hard-drive space so that may not leave too much space for the video footage you’d like to edit with your Chromebook. Even the latest Chromebooks offer barely enough processing power required to run more demanding editing software, so using the software like the Virtual Box may limit their performance even more.</li>
</ul>
<p>Chromebook owners who would like to have access to Mac and Windows video editing apps will benefit more if they choose to install the Chromebook Desktop Remote application because it is easier to use and it has performed much better than all other methods of accessing software designed for Mac, Windows or Linux operating systems.</p>
