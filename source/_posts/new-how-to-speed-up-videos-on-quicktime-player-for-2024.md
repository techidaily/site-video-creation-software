In historic terms, cinema is still a relatively new art, and yet the amount of footage that has been filmed since the Lumière brothers released their first film is staggering. Capturing unique materials that were never seen by the world before has become the question of prestige among the filmmakers. Nonetheless, certain genres of film are almost entirely dependent on the public domain footage. Documentaries about historic events, space or any other topic that is impossible to stage rely on the videos that entered the public domain for one reason or the other. That’s why in this article, we are going to take you through some of the best websites that let you download public domain videos.

## What is Public Domain Video?

Any video that is not subject to copyright can be considered a public domain video. This means that anyone can use this footage for free without having to ask for permission to do so. Videos can enter the public domain under the following circumstances:

* If the footage was produced by a government because governments are obligated by the law to offer the footage to the public domain.
* In case the author of the footage has forfeited his or her copyrights and dedicated the footage to the public domain
* A film or any other work of art becomes public domain 70 years after the death of the copyright holder. The expiration date of the copyrights is not the same in all the countries around the world, which is why you must make sure that the video you want to use is, in fact, a public domain video.

In addition, you should avoid using the footage that contains art or music that can be described as third-party intellectual property because you may unintentionally infringe copyrights.

## Best Online Websites Where You Can Download Public Domain Videos

**Finding free public domain footage or public movies** on the Internet has never been too difficult, as you can watch thousands of public domain movies on YouTube, but you cannot download them. Over the course of the last couple of decades, the websites where you can **download public domain footage** have grown in number, which makes it somewhat easier to find the video clips you can use in your projects for free. Here are some of the best online destinations where you can **download public domain videos**.

#### 1. [Prelinger Archive](https://archive.org/details/prelinger)

![Public Domain Video Download ](https://images.wondershare.com/filmora/article-images/prelinger-achives-public-domain-video-collection.jpg)

With more than 17,000 items in the collection, the Prelinger Archive is probably one of the largest public domain video libraries on the Internet.

You can **download public domain video clips** created by educational institutions, advertising companies, trade associations or corporations from this impressive collection. There are different download options available for each file, so you can choose the size of a file and the method you’re going to use to download a file to your computer.

#### 2. [The Public Domain Review](https://publicdomainreview.org/collections/?medium=film)

![Pond 5 Public Domain Video Download ](https://images.wondershare.com/filmora/article-images/pond5-free-public-domain-collection.jpg)

#### 6. [Vidsplay](https://www.vidsplay.com/)

All video clips you can find on this platform are free, so you just have to select one of the categories and start browsing through the available public domain stock footage.

#### 9. [NASA’s Video Gallery](https://images.nasa.gov/)

Space exploration is undoubtedly one of the hottest topics of our era, so if you are looking for some space public domain videos NASA’s website is the best place to start. Like all other government institutions, NASA is obligated by the law to offer all images and videos to the public domain. This means that all content you download from their website is free to use. Simply insert the search term and browse the results until you find the video clip you want to save to your computer. However, most public domain videos you can download from NASA’s website last only a couple of minutes.

#### 10. [Motion Elements](https://www.motionelements.com/free/stock-footage)

The collection of **free public domain stock footage,** this website offers contains more than 4,000 clips.

## Is It Okay to Use Public Domain Videos for Commercial Purposes?

All public domain videos can be used for both commercial and non-commercial projects, but you must approach using public domain videos for commercial purposes with caution. Crediting the author or providing the source from which you acquired the footage will reduce the likelihood of legal complications. The public domain videos that feature famous actors or third party intellectual property can also be a subject of legal disputes, which is why it is better to avoid using them on commercial projects.

## What Should You Do If You Can’t Find Public Domain Footage for Your Project?

Opting for videos that are protected by the [Creative Commons licenses](https://creativecommons.org/licenses/) is probably the safest option if you’re struggling to find the public domain footage you’d like to use in your project. Respecting the terms of the license under which a video is protected is of utmost importance, since failing to properly credit the author of the video, for instance, can have legal consequences. There are several different types of Creative Commons licenses and you must find out which one covers the video you’d like to use, before publishing your video. You can find more information about Creative Commons licenses at the [FAQ](https://creativecommons.org/faq/).

**Conclusion**

Public domain videos cover very different topics, which means that the nature of your project determines the source from which you’ll acquire the footage. If you are researching the early days of cinema, then you’ll have no trouble downloading the public domain videos, but if the topic you’re exploring is more contemporary, finding the content you can use without any restrictions can prove to be troublesome. Which website do you like to use the most to download public domain videos? Leave a comment and share your opinions with us.

In historic terms, cinema is still a relatively new art, and yet the amount of footage that has been filmed since the Lumière brothers released their first film is staggering. Capturing unique materials that were never seen by the world before has become the question of prestige among the filmmakers.

That’s why in this article, we are going to take you through some of the best websites that let you download public domain videos.

## What is Public Domain Video?

Any video that is not subject to copyright can be considered a public domain video. This means that anyone can use this footage for free without having to ask for permission to do so. Videos can enter the public domain under the following circumstances:

* If the footage was produced by a government because governments are obligated by the law to offer the footage to the public domain.
* In case the author of the footage has forfeited his or her copyrights and dedicated the footage to the public domain
* A film or any other work of art becomes public domain 70 years after the death of the copyright holder. The expiration date of the copyrights is not the same in all the countries around the world, which is why you must make sure that the video you want to use is, in fact, a public domain video.

In addition, you should avoid using the footage that contains art or music that can be described as third-party intellectual property because you may unintentionally infringe copyrights.
