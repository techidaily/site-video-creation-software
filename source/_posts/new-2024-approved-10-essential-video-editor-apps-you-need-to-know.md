## Getting Started with HD Video: A Guide to Pixel Size and Resolution

##### Versatile Video Editor - Wondershare Filmora

Video resolution is a way to determine how realistic or clear your video appears. You can measure it with the number of pixels in a standard aspect ratio (16:9).

16:9 is one of the most common aspect ratios for TV or computer screens. Also, a higher number of video aspect ratio pixels means high resolution.

The 720 or 1080 resolutions have naming conventions usually based on the pixels running in the vertical line of the display area. Whereas resolutions like 2K, 4K, or 8K have naming conventions based on pixels numbers in the horizontal lines across digital frames.

The growth of video sharing on social media has ensured the adoption of HD definition screens. So, let us know more about its concepts.

#### In this article

01 [What is HD Video?](#Part 1)

02 [What is the Pixel Size of HD Video?](#Part 2)

03 [Video Resolution and Corresponding File Sizes?](#Part 3)

04 [Are 480P, 720P, 960P Considered HD?](#Part 4)

05 [Is HD 2K or 1K?](#Part 5)

06 [How to Change Video Resolution Easily?](#Part 6)

## Part 1 What is HD Video?

High-definition video (HDV) is a third-generation technology for videos. Its video resolution, file size, and screen size are more significant than a standard video or other video forms. It provides more flexibility, including technical variables of videos.

![HDV](https://images.wondershare.com/filmora/article-images/2021/hd-video-pixel-size-1.jpg)

Generally, it is a video with 1280×720 (720p) or 1920×1080 (1080p) resolutions. It's all formats are widescreen and display 24 to 60 frames in a second.

## Part 2 What is the Pixel Size of HD Video?

HD Video is the lowest video resolution accepted for the web content of smaller size. However, most screens are available in HD nowadays. So, it would be best to use a resolution higher than 720 p for streaming or web.

Pixel Size of HD video is 1280 x 720.

## Part 3 Video resolution and corresponding file sizes

Video resolutions are the standards set by video manufacturers or broadcasting companies. Video resolution is similar to a haircut. You can always decrease a high-resolution video to a lower one but can never increase the low resolution.

So, decide the video resolutions keeping storage space and other aspects in mind. Here are different formats that can help you to make a wise decision:

### 1\. Standard Definition

Standard Definition does not have many pixels; as a result, it has low resolution. Two common SD resolutions are 640× 480 and 640×360\. These resolutions are the best for small mobiles.

It is an excellent option to consider if you have a slow internet connection.

### 2\. 720 Resolution (HD)

It is the lowest video resolution and is often called HD. Usually, you shoot most videos at 1080p, but 720p can still be acceptable to create smaller web content. However, it would be best to aim for a resolution higher than 720p.

### 3\. 1080 Resolution (Full HD)

1080 (1920 \* 1080 pixels), often known as Full HD, is the industry standard for making a digital video. It does not need much storage space and is a typical screen resolution for digital phones.

### 4\. 2K Resolution or QHD (Quad High Definition)

2K resolution (2048 x 1080 pixels)or QHD (2560 x 1440 pixels) formats provide room for photo edits. In addition, they offer larger displays or reframing files without their lost quality.

### 5\. 4K Resolution (Ultra HD)

Ultra HD, often known as 4K resolution, is 3840 x 2160 pixels technically. It looks similar to 2K to the viewers but gives videomakers some room to zoom in or edit.

![File Size](https://images.wondershare.com/filmora/article-images/2021/hd-video-pixel-size-2.jpg)

## Part 4 Are 480P, 720P, 960P Considered HD?

* 720p is also popular with the name HD (high-definition). It is a display resolution that measures 1280 x 720 pixels.
* 480p often known as Standard Definition (SD). It usually starts at 240 p and ends at 480 p. So, 480 p is a semi-HD.
* 960 X 480 p is a progressive camera scan format usually used in surveillance cameras, webcams, or action POV cams. It adds a wide horizontal view as compared to the standard definition. But it is less than HD.

## Part 5 Is HD 2K or 1K?

1K means there are 1000 pixels. So 1080p, as in the vertical portion of a screen, is 1K. In contrast, a typical 1080p resolution with the horizontal part is 1920, or 2K.

Although 1080p has the exact vertical resolution like DCI 2K resolutions (1080 pixels), it has a smaller horizontal resolution. As a result, it is below the range of 2K resolution formats.

1080p is almost equivalent to 2K. It is because "p" and "i" measure the height of an image in pixels, while "K" measures the width of an image in thousands of pixels.

So with a size of 1080 pixels, the corresponding width of 1920 pixels uses a 16:9 aspect ratio.

Video resolution is a way to determine how realistic or clear your video appears. You can measure it with the number of pixels in a standard aspect ratio (16:9).

16:9 is one of the most common aspect ratios for TV or computer screens. Also, a higher number of video aspect ratio pixels means high resolution.

The 720 or 1080 resolutions have naming conventions usually based on the pixels running in the vertical line of the display area. Whereas resolutions like 2K, 4K, or 8K have naming conventions based on pixels numbers in the horizontal lines across digital frames.

The growth of video sharing on social media has ensured the adoption of HD definition screens. So, let us know more about its concepts.

## Part 1 What is HD Video?

High-definition video (HDV) is a third-generation technology for videos. Its video resolution, file size, and screen size are more significant than a standard video or other video forms. It provides more flexibility, including technical variables of videos.

![HDV](https://images.wondershare.com/filmora/article-images/2021/hd-video-pixel-size-1.jpg)

Generally, it is a video with 1280×720 (720p) or 1920×1080 (1080p) resolutions. It's all formats are widescreen and display 24 to 60 frames in a second.

## Part 2 What is the Pixel Size of HD Video?

HD Video is the lowest video resolution accepted for the web content of smaller size. However, most screens are available in HD nowadays. So, it would be best to use a resolution higher than 720 p for streaming or web.

Pixel Size of HD video is 1280 x 720.

## Part 3 Video resolution and corresponding file sizes

Video resolutions are the standards set by video manufacturers or broadcasting companies. Video resolution is similar to a haircut. You can always decrease a high-resolution video to a lower one but can never increase the low resolution.

So, decide the video resolutions keeping storage space and other aspects in mind. Here are different formats that can help you to make a wise decision:

### 1\. Standard Definition

Standard Definition does not have many pixels; as a result, it has low resolution. Two common SD resolutions are 640× 480 and 640×360\. These resolutions are the best for small mobiles.

It is an excellent option to consider if you have a slow internet connection.

### 2\. 720 Resolution (HD)

It is the lowest video resolution and is often called HD. Usually, you shoot most videos at 1080p, but 720p can still be acceptable to create smaller web content. However, it would be best to aim for a resolution higher than 720p.

### 3\. 1080 Resolution (Full HD)

1080 (1920 \* 1080 pixels), often known as Full HD, is the industry standard for making a digital video. It does not need much storage space and is a typical screen resolution for digital phones.

### 4\. 2K Resolution or QHD (Quad High Definition)

2K resolution (2048 x 1080 pixels)or QHD (2560 x 1440 pixels) formats provide room for photo edits. In addition, they offer larger displays or reframing files without their lost quality.

### 5\. 4K Resolution (Ultra HD)

Ultra HD, often known as 4K resolution, is 3840 x 2160 pixels technically. It looks similar to 2K to the viewers but gives videomakers some room to zoom in or edit.

![File Size](https://images.wondershare.com/filmora/article-images/2021/hd-video-pixel-size-2.jpg)

The amount of video content uploaded to the Internet each day is staggering, as people around the globe create hundreds of hours of videos daily. As a result, the videos you upload to social media must stand out in this sea of content to get thousands of views, shares, or likes.

**[Speeding up or slowing down the footage](https://tools.techidaily.com/wondershare/filmora/download/)** is a simple and yet effective video editing technique that can make the content you share online more entertaining to watch. Read on if you would like to find out more about **slow and fast motion video apps for iOS and Android** devices you can use to process your footage before posting it on your social media accounts.

## 10 Best Video Speed Changing Apps for iOS and Android

Sharing the raw footage, you capture on a Smartphone with your friends and followers may not always produce the results you’re hoping for. Slowing down the playback speed can make a scene more entertaining or highlight an important moment in your video. Increasing a video’s playback speed is a great option if you want to create breathtaking time-lapses. So, let’s take a look at the **10 best video speed-changing apps for slow and fast motion video editing on iOS and Android devices.**

### 1\. Filmora for mobile

**Price:** Free, but offers in-app purchases

**Supported OS:** [iOS](https://app.adjust.com/w06dr6m%5F19za1f6) 11.0 or later, [Android](https://app.adjust.com/w06dr6m%5F19za1f6) 4.2 and up

Changing the playback speed of the footage you edit with Filmora takes just a few moments since this cross-platform app enables all of its users to choose how rapidly the frames in each shot will be displayed on the screen.

This app provides a versatile set of video editing tools, enabling you to **enhance the colors in your videos**, make a soundtrack or even **[create a PIP effect](https://tools.techidaily.com/wondershare/filmora/download/)**. The only downside is that the free version of the app watermarks all videos you export from it, and you must make an in-app purchase in order to remove the watermark from your videos.

**Pros**

* Simple video playback speed adjustment process
* A rich library of visual effects
* Supports all common video file formats
* Versatile color correction tools

**Cons**

* All videos created with the free version of Filmora are watermarked

As its name suggests, this video editing app provides YouTubers and Vloggers with all the tools they need to create the content they share with their followers. As soon as you record a new video clip with your iPhone or Android phone, you can import it into the app and remove all parts you don’t want to include in the final cut.

Altering the speed of a video clip is easy since you have to decide if you want to speed up or slow down a video and then insert a new playback speed value.

The app offers 26 fully customizable themes, and it enables its users to [combine photos and videos.](https://tools.techidaily.com/wondershare/filmora/download/)

Creating a slow-motion or fast-forward video with Quik is a straightforward process that can be completed in just a few taps. You can export all of your projects from Quick in Full HD resolution, but the app currently doesn’t support 4K footage.

With this app, you don’t need any video editing experience to create slow or fast motion videos. Import the footage you recorded with your Android phone and choose one of the preset video playback options. The app lets you increase or decrease a video clip’s speed up to four times, so you have to select the portion of a video you’d like to speed up or slow down and export it to your phone’s gallery.

Optionally, you can [add music to each video](https://tools.techidaily.com/wondershare/filmora/download/) you edit with this app, but you won’t be able to perform color corrections or apply visual effects to the footage you process with this app.

![videoshop video editor for changing video speed](https://images.wondershare.com/filmora/article-images/videoshop-interface.jpg)

Performing all basic video editing tasks, like [cutting or merging video clips,](https://tools.techidaily.com/wondershare/filmora/download/) doesn’t require advanced video editing skills.

Increasing or decreasing a video’s playback speed takes only a few minutes, enabling you to post fast or slow-motion videos on your social media accounts just a few moments after you recorded them.

![slow fast slow - control the speed](https://images.wondershare.com/filmora/article-images/slow-fast-slow-control-the-speed-of-your-videos.jpg)

iPhone, iPad, and iPod touch owners can use this app to control the playback speed of all videos they record with their devices. The app’s timeline is designed to help you set points at specific segments of the video, enabling you to speed up or slow down only a portion of the video clip without cutting it.

KineMaster is one of the [best video editing apps for iOS](https://tools.techidaily.com/wondershare/filmora/download/) and Android devices you can find on the market. That’s why it is hardly surprising that the app offers powerful tools that enable its users to create slow-motion videos and time-lapses.

In addition, KineMaster is equipped with EQ presets and audio editing tools you’re going to need to fix the original audio of the video clips you speed up or slow down.

![speedpro slow speed video edit](https://images.wondershare.com/filmora/article-images/speedpro-slow-speed-video-edit.jpg)

Changing a video clip’s playback speed with this app is a simple three-step process. After you import a video clip into the app, you will be taken to the Adjust Speed screen, where you can choose if you want to alter the playback speed of an entire video clip or speed up or slow down a particular segment of a video.

Afterward, you have to drag the Video Speed slider to the left or to the right and the app will automatically adjust the speed of your video. When done, you can import an audio file from your phone and proceed to export the file to the camera roll or upload it to YouTube or Instagram.

**Pros**

* Changing a video’s playback speed requires you to drag a slider

You can [change a video’s playback speed in iMovie](https://tools.techidaily.com/wondershare/filmora/download/) even if you have never edited a video before. After you create a new project and import a video clip into the app, you have to tap on the Speed icon. A slider that enables you to reduce a video’s playback speed to 1/8 of its original speed or make it twice as fast will appear on the screen, so you can drag it left or right to set a new playback speed for your video.

If you are not happy with the results, you can tap on the Reset button, and iMovie will return the playback speed of your video clip to its normal value.

**Pros**

* Free and easy playback speed adjustment process
