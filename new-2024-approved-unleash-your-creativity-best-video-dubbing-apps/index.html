<p>As it is now the second decade of the 21st century, data carriers like DVDs are slowly becoming obsolete. A growing number of laptop and desktop PCs no longer feature optical disc drives, while the discontinuation of the Windows Media Center marked the end of an era in which Windows OS offered a built-in DVD player.</p>
<p>The Windows 10 doesn’t have a native app that enables you to play movies or music from DVD and Blu-ray discs, and you must install a third-party DVD<a class="link"   target="_blank" rel="noopener" href="https://tools.techidaily.com/wondershare/filmora/download/" >video player <i class="fa-regular fa-arrow-up-right-from-square fa-sm"></i></a> if you want to view content from these sources.

The platform has various tools that provide you with different ways to make engaging lyric videos. Below are the summarized steps of creating a professional lyric video in Wondershare Filmora video editor.</p>
<p><strong>Step 1: Add and edit music in the timeline</strong></p>
<p>Since we are going to make a lyric video, let’s import the audio track to the timeline first, add the fade-in or fade-out effect to make it smoother if needed.</p>
<p><img  
                     lazyload
                     src="/images/loading.svg"
                     data-src="https://images.wondershare.com/filmora/article-images/add-music-to-filmora-timeline.jpg"
                      alt="Add music to Filmora Timeline"
                ></p>
<p><strong>Step</strong> <strong>2: Choose Sample Color background</strong></p>
<p>After launching Filmora, go to the Sample Color category under the Media tab, and you will find many sample colors to choose from. Drag and drop one into the timeline.</p>
<p><img  
                     lazyload
                     src="/images/loading.svg"
                     data-src="https://images.wondershare.com/filmora/article-images/filmora-sample-color-library.jpg"
                      alt=" Filmora sample color library"
                ></p>
<p><strong>Step 3:</strong> <strong>Add and customize texts to the lyric video</strong></p>
<p>Filmora video editor offers a wide variety of pre-written content and lets the creators drag and drop to see how it looks, with no need for editing or other typical copywriting tasks. Go to the Titles tab, drag the desired text over to the sample color video track. Here, we prefer to use a default title</p>
<p><img  
                     lazyload
                     src="/images/loading.svg"
                     data-src="https://images.wondershare.com/filmora/article-images/customize-lyric-titles-filmora.jpg"
                      alt=" Filmora customize lyrics"
                ></p>
<p>Double click the titles in the timeline to customize the texts, fonts, colors, or animations. Click the Advanced button for a new window pops up where you can add a title box and do more customization. Such as giving the titles individual animation.</p>
<p><strong>Step 4: Add effects for texts</strong></p>
<p><img  
                     lazyload
                     src="/images/loading.svg"
                     data-src="https://images.wondershare.com/filmora/article-images/add-mild-effects-to-lyric-video.jpg"
                      alt=" add mile effects to  lyrics"
                ></p>
<p>To make the whole title dynamic, we can add some effects to the texts. Go to the Effects tab and then click on mild effects to put the mild effects to the text. Right-click the Mild effect and go to Properties to change its frequency and positions if needed.</p>
<p> <strong>Step</strong> <strong>5: Add</strong> <strong>transitions to texts</strong></p>
<p>Filmora video editor provides lots of transitions for playing the video smoother. Go to the Transitions tab and choose one and place it between each title to make the lyric video vivid.</p>
<p><img  
                     lazyload
                     src="/images/loading.svg"

The platform has various tools that provide you with different ways to make engaging lyric videos. Below are the summarized steps of creating a professional lyric video in Wondershare Filmora video editor.</p>
<p><strong>Step 1: Add and edit music in the timeline</strong></p>
<p>Since we are going to make a lyric video, let’s import the audio track to the timeline first, add the fade-in or fade-out effect to make it smoother if needed.</p>
<p><img  
                     lazyload
                     src="/images/loading.svg"
                     data-src="https://images.wondershare.com/filmora/article-images/add-music-to-filmora-timeline.jpg"
                      alt="Add music to Filmora Timeline"
                ></p>
<p><strong>Step</strong> <strong>2: Choose Sample Color background</strong></p>
<p>After launching Filmora, go to the Sample Color category under the Media tab, and you will find many sample colors to choose from. Drag and drop one into the timeline.</p>
<p><img  
                     lazyload
                     src="/images/loading.svg"
                     data-src="https://images.wondershare.com/filmora/article-images/filmora-sample-color-library.jpg"
                      alt=" Filmora sample color library"
                ></p>
<p><strong>Step 3:</strong> <strong>Add and customize texts to the lyric video</strong></p>
<p>Filmora video editor offers a wide variety of pre-written content and lets the creators drag and drop to see how it looks, with no need for editing or other typical copywriting tasks. Go to the Titles tab, drag the desired text over to the sample color video track. Here, we prefer to use a default title</p>
<p><img  
                     lazyload
                     src="/images/loading.svg"
                     data-src="https://images.wondershare.com/filmora/article-images/customize-lyric-titles-filmora.jpg"
                      alt=" Filmora customize lyrics"
                ></p>
<p>Double click the titles in the timeline to customize the texts, fonts, colors, or animations. Click the Advanced button for a new window pops up where you can add a title box and do more customization. Such as giving the titles individual animation.</p>
<p><strong>Step 4: Add effects for texts</strong></p>
<p><img  
                     lazyload
                     src="/images/loading.svg"
                     data-src="https://images.wondershare.com/filmora/article-images/add-mild-effects-to-lyric-video.jpg"
                      alt=" add mile effects to  lyrics"
                ></p>
<p>To make the whole title dynamic, we can add some effects to the texts. Go to the Effects tab and then click on mild effects to put the mild effects to the text. Right-click the Mild effect and go to Properties to change its frequency and positions if needed.</p>
<p> <strong>Step</strong> <strong>5: Add</strong> <strong>transitions to texts</strong></p>
<p>Filmora video editor provides lots of transitions for playing the video smoother. Go to the Transitions tab and choose one and place it between each title to make the lyric video vivid.</p>
<p><img  
                     lazyload
                     src="/images/loading.svg"

The professionals can create creative and engaging lyric videos to grab the attention of their viewers</p>
<p>You can follow these tips to make good lyric videos:</p>
<p><strong>Accuracy</strong></p>
<p>You should make sure that there is 100% accuracy in the lyric video you are creating. If there are wrong lyrics on any of your lyric videos, your followers may not prefer watching your other lyric videos. So, double-check or triple-check the lyrics before sharing them with your fans.</p>
<p><strong>Theme&#x2F;Background</strong></p>
<p>You should pick an attractive theme for creating an engaging video. No doubt, a video having a central theme attracts the viewers a lot.</p>
<p><strong>Color</strong></p>
<p>You should select an efficient and eye-catching color scheme for your lyric video. That is because it is helpful in elevating the visual appeal of the video, which in turn gains the attention of the viewers.</p>
<p><strong>Fonts</strong></p>
<p>A lyric video is all about fonts because the viewers are interested in reading the lyrics. So, you should select interesting fonts and should focus on font style, size, and color. The fonts should sync in with the video’s vibe so that the viewer can enjoy watching it.</p>
<p><strong>Transitions&#x2F;Filters</strong></p>
<p>You should use filters that could blend with the song’s vibe. Choose the transitions that look natural and appealing. Never bombard your video with too many transitions and filters.</p>
