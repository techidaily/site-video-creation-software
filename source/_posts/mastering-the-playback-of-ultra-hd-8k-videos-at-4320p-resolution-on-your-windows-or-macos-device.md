4320p/8k video has made its way on the famous online video website-Youtube earlier this year, and Sharp's 4320p/8k display is reportedly ready to roll at the end of October! Although both 4320p video source and display are available for us, a real professional [4320p video player](https://tools.techidaily.com/5kplayer/products/) has not reached a wide range of Mac/PC users. Here we sincerely introduces a decent media player to help play 4320p video on Mac/PC flawlessly!

4320p or 8k full ultra HD resolution comes out to a minimum dimension of 7680x4320, 16 times that of mainstream 1080p resolution, and can go as high as 8192x8192\. Such high definition video always adopts H.265/HEVC codec which is able to handle the sheer number of pixels (33.2 million)! That is to say only media players support H.265/HEVC format are capable of playing 4320p UHD videos successfully.
