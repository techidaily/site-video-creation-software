## Part 3: FAQs About Windows 11 Video Editors

**1\. Does Windows 11 have Movie Maker?**

The short answer is, no, it doesn’t. Microsoft removed Movie Maker from its operating systems long ago. Now, in Windows 11, it’s the Photos app that does all the work that Movie Maker used to do earlier.

**2\. Should you upgrade to Windows 11 for video editing?**

Although Windows 11 is new and offers several advanced features, at the time of this writing, not all third-party apps have been upgraded by their corresponding vendors to become compatible with the OS. Therefore, you are suggested to wait until Windows 11 is rolled out for all the regions of the globe, and most of the apps, if not all, start working flawlessly on this new operating system.

But Wondershare has taken care of that small inconvenience.
