 Wax is a light weight but high performance and flexible video editing, composition and special effects software. And above all, it's a free video editor for both commercial and personal use. Wax can create 2D & 3D special effects and can work in two modes - as a standalone application and as a "plug-in" to video editors/NLEs like VirtualDub, Sony Vegas, Adobe Premiere, etc.

 This is the getting-started tutorial for Wax. In this Wax tutorial, we are going to show you how to zoom, crop and pan video and image, how to make project settings and how to render AVI videos.

---

 Note: If you think Wax is something complicated, you can turn to [Wondershare Filmora](https://tools.techidaily.com/wondershare/filmora/download/), which enables you to edit videos with separate tracks and add transitions to your videos, finally, convert your video to any video format you like.Download the free trial version of Wondershare Filmora (originally Wondershare Video Editor) (Windows/Mac) below.

[![Download Win Version](https://images.wondershare.com/filmora/guide/download-btn-win.jpg)](https://tools.techidaily.com/wondershare/filmora/download/)[Download Mac Version](https://images.wondershare.com/filmora/guide/download-btn-mac.jpg)](https://tools.techidaily.com/wondershare/filmora/download/)

---

#### 1. Zoom, crop and pan image for video

 Download Wax and install it first. Run the software and Load Media Files by right-clicking on MediaPool panel. But this doesn't finish. To edit video, you need to drag-n-drop desired media files to the timeline. Then switch to Video Plugins to drag-n-drop Quick 3d plugin to the just added track.

![wax free video editor](https://images.wondershare.com/topic/video-editing/wax.jpg)

 As shown above, click the triangle next to Quick 3d, you would see many options such as Posx, Posz, Cropleft, Cropbottom, etc. Please see detailed instructions to make editing in Wax:

**Zoom Video**: Click the Posz clock icon to set Keyframming mode to Linear, and then change the value by hanging over mouse to ZEROs and drag to left/right.

**Crop Video**: Click the Cropleft/Croptop/Cropright/Cropbottom clock icon to set Keyframming mode to Linear, and then change the value by hanging over mouse to ZEROs and drag to left/right.

**Pan Video**: Click the Posx clock icon to set Keyframming mode to Linear, and then change the value by hanging over mouse to ZEROs and drag to left/right.

 Note that you could preview the video while making settings in the top preview windows.

#### 2. Make project settings

 Press F3 or click the Project Settings button in the tool bar to bring up the dialog. There, specify the file name, save path and video options, including video dimensions, frame rate, and click OK.

![how to use wax](https://images.wondershare.com/topic/video-editing/wax-settings.jpg)

#### 3. Render AVI video

 Click the green arrow button on the tool bar to start saving video to specified path in the project settings. A few minutes later, you will get the edited video.

## FCPX Visual Storytelling: Using Freeze Frames and Slow Motion for Impact

# Final Cut Pro X: Freeze-Frames and Slow Motion

![author avatar](https://images.wondershare.com/filmora/article-images/benjamin-arango-author.jpg)

##### Benjamin Arango

 Mar 27, 2024• Proven solutions

A very simple, yet very effective effect is changing the speed of a video clip. This could be a simple still-frame (also called "Freeze Frame") or playing a clip in slow or fast motion.

This article shows you how to do this using Final Cut Pro X.

For more tutorials on slow-motion please refer to this article: [Top 10 Slow Motion Video Editing Software.](https://tools.techidaily.com/wondershare/filmora/download/)

## Freeze-Frames and Slow Motion in Final Cut Pro X

#### 1\.  STILL FRAMES

![still frames](https://images.wondershare.com/multimedia/speed001.jpg)

A still-frame freezes action. For instance, here is a clip of a hummingbird getting ready to land on a bird feeder. I want to create a freeze-frame of the bird in flight. (Um, yeah, I use "freeze-frame" and "still-frame" interchangeably.)

In Final Cut Pro X, put the playhead (or skimmer) on the frame you want to freeze and type Option+F.

![freeze frames](https://images.wondershare.com/multimedia/speed002.jpg)

This creates a two-second freeze-frame at the position of the playhead.

![create freeze frame](https://images.wondershare.com/multimedia/speed003.jpg)

Adjust the duration of the frame by trimming the edge; just like any other clip. Here, for example, I'm making the duration of the freeze-frame 11 frames shorter.

![freeze frames in FCP X](https://images.wondershare.com/multimedia/speed004.jpg)

In case you were wondering, this is what the freeze looks like. It freezes the flight of the hummingbird in the middle of playback, allowing us to add graphics or other text then resume the action as though nothing had happened.

Very cool, except....

Well, the good news is that this is fast and easy. The bad news is that we can't change the location of the still frame.

So, here's another way to do this.

Put the playhead (or skimmer, but I prefer the playhead) on the frame you want to freeze, select the clip, then type Shift+F.

![Playhead](https://images.wondershare.com/multimedia/speed005.jpg)

This locates the source clip in the Browser, selects both the Browser and the clip, and matches the position of the In, Out, and playhead.

![match clips](https://images.wondershare.com/multimedia/speed006.jpg)

Now, with the Browser selected, type Option+F. This creates a freeze-frame of the Browser clip and places it at the location of the playhead as a connected clip in the Timeline.

As a connected clip, we can move this new freeze-frame wherever we want. However, be careful in moving the clip, because, unless you mark the original frame with a marker (type "M"), there's no easy way to match the still frame with the source frame, once the still frame is moved somewhere else.

I use both these techniques in many different projects.

#### 2\.  HOLD FRAME

A Hold Frame is similar to an in-line still frame, but with more flexibility.

![hold frame](https://images.wondershare.com/multimedia/speed013.jpg)

Put the playhead (or skimmer) on the frame you want to hold. Then, Then, using either Modify > Retime or the "Smurf-on-a-headset" Toolbar icon, choose Hold Frame (or type: Shift+H).

![hold frames in fcp x](https://images.wondershare.com/multimedia/speed014.jpg)

This displays the orange Retime editor bar above the clip, with a small red portion indicating the Hold frame.

![create hold frames](https://images.wondershare.com/multimedia/speed015.jpg)

Change the duration of the Hold frame by dragging the small thumb at the right end of the red bar.

![speed016](https://images.wondershare.com/multimedia/speed016.jpg)

Add a speed ramp transition at the end of the Hold frame by clicking the downward-pointing arrow next to the word "Hold" in the Retime Editor.

![speed018](https://images.wondershare.com/multimedia/speed018.jpg)

To change the actual frame being held, double-click the bar icon to the LEFT of the red Hold section and choose Source Frame (Edit). This allows you to slide the Hold frame selection left or right.

NOTE: Changing the source frame is a feature that I like a LOT!

#### 3\.  SLOW (or FAST) MOTION

![fast/slow motion](https://images.wondershare.com/multimedia/speed007.jpg)

We use slow-motion to show events that are too fast for the unaided eye to see. And fast motion to speed up very slow events. Both of these effects use what's called a "constant speed change," where the entire clip changes by the same amount - either faster or slower.

WE create either effect using the same tools, just different values. Here's how.

![slow motion](https://images.wondershare.com/multimedia/speed008.jpg)

Select the clip who's speed you want to change. Then, using either Modify > Retime or the "Smurf" Toolbar icon, select Slow (or Fast).

Choose one of the available speeds; in this case, 50%. (Yes, you can change this to any value you want, I'll show you how in a minute.)

![create slow/fast motion](https://images.wondershare.com/multimedia/speed009.jpg)

Three things happen at once:

* The duration of the clip changes
* The orange Retiming bar appears over the top of the clip
* The speed of the clip changes

![speed010](https://images.wondershare.com/multimedia/speed010.jpg)

To reset the speed back to normal (100%), click the downward-pointing arrow in the Retiming bar and choose Normal (100%).

There are two ways to change the speed of a clip.

![speed017](https://images.wondershare.com/multimedia/speed017.jpg)

The easy way is to grab the small handle at the end of the clip and drag left or right. The speed will change as you drag it.

Or, for more precision, click the downward-pointing arrow in the Retiming bar and choose Custom.

![speed011](https://images.wondershare.com/multimedia/speed011.jpg)

This opens a new dialog allowing a number of changes:

* Reverse. Plays the clip in reverse.
* Rate. Select a specific speed change as a percentage of normal speed for a clip. Less than 100% is slow-motion. More than 100% is fast-motion.
* Duration. Select a specific duration for a clip and FCP X will calculate how fast or slow it needs to go.
* Ripple. When checked, adjusts the duration of a clip based upon the speed. When unchecked, the clip duration remains fixed even when speed changes.

You will get the smoothest speed changes when the percentage you choose divides evenly into 200\. For example, 100, 66, 50, 40, 33, 25, 20, 10 and so on.

#### 4\.  EXTRA CREDIT

There is one more setting to consider when slowing a clip. (This does not apply when creating fast motion.)

![speed012](https://images.wondershare.com/multimedia/speed012.jpg)

Using, again, either Modify > Retime or the "Smurf" menu, select Video Quality.

* Normal. This is the best choice for speeds of 50% or faster.
* Frame Blending. This is the best choice for speeds of about 20% to 50%.
* Optical Flow. This is the best choice for speeds slower than about 20%.

Frame blending puts a short dissolve between frames when running in slow motion to improve the illusion of motion. Optical Flow invents in-between frames to minimize the jerkiness of extremely slow motion.

Frame blending is relatively fast and easy. Optical Flow will look better in most cases, but takes a long time to render.

To reset the speed back to normal (100%), click the downward-pointing arrow in the Retiming bar and choose Normal (100%).

There are two ways to change the speed of a clip.

![speed017](https://images.wondershare.com/multimedia/speed017.jpg)

The easy way is to grab the small handle at the end of the clip and drag left or right. The speed will change as you drag it.

Or, for more precision, click the downward-pointing arrow in the Retiming bar and choose Custom.

![speed011](https://images.wondershare.com/multimedia/speed011.jpg)

This opens a new dialog allowing a number of changes:

* Reverse. Plays the clip in reverse.
* Rate. Select a specific speed change as a percentage of normal speed for a clip. Less than 100% is slow-motion. More than 100% is fast-motion.
* Duration. Select a specific duration for a clip and FCP X will calculate how fast or slow it needs to go.
* Ripple. When checked, adjusts the duration of a clip based upon the speed. When unchecked, the clip duration remains fixed even when speed changes.

You will get the smoothest speed changes when the percentage you choose divides evenly into 200\. For example, 100, 66, 50, 40, 33, 25, 20, 10 and so on.

#### 4\.  EXTRA CREDIT

There is one more setting to consider when slowing a clip. (This does not apply when creating fast motion.)

![speed012](https://images.wondershare.com/multimedia/speed012.jpg)

Using, again, either Modify > Retime or the "Smurf" menu, select Video Quality.

* Normal. This is the best choice for speeds of 50% or faster.
* Frame Blending. This is the best choice for speeds of about 20% to 50%.
* Optical Flow. This is the best choice for speeds slower than about 20%.

Frame blending puts a short dissolve between frames when running in slow motion to improve the illusion of motion. Optical Flow invents in-between frames to minimize the jerkiness of extremely slow motion.

Frame blending is relatively fast and easy. Optical Flow will look better in most cases, but takes a long time to render.

A very simple, yet very effective effect is changing the speed of a video clip. This could be a simple still-frame (also called "Freeze Frame") or playing a clip in slow or fast motion.

This article shows you how to do this using Final Cut Pro X.

For more tutorials on slow-motion please refer to this article: [Top 10 Slow Motion Video Editing Software.](https://tools.techidaily.com/wondershare/filmora/download/)

## Freeze-Frames and Slow Motion in Final Cut Pro X

#### 1\.  STILL FRAMES

![still frames](https://images.wondershare.com/multimedia/speed001.jpg)

A still-frame freezes action. For instance, here is a clip of a hummingbird getting ready to land on a bird feeder. I want to create a freeze-frame of the bird in flight. (Um, yeah, I use "freeze-frame" and "still-frame" interchangeably.)

In Final Cut Pro X, put the playhead (or skimmer) on the frame you want to freeze and type Option+F.

![freeze frames](https://images.wondershare.com/multimedia/speed002.jpg)

This creates a two-second freeze-frame at the position of the playhead.

![create freeze frame](https://images.wondershare.com/multimedia/speed003.jpg)

Adjust the duration of the frame by trimming the edge; just like any other clip. Here, for example, I'm making the duration of the freeze-frame 11 frames shorter.

![freeze frames in FCP X](https://images.wondershare.com/multimedia/speed004.jpg)

In case you were wondering, this is what the freeze looks like. It freezes the flight of the hummingbird in the middle of playback, allowing us to add graphics or other text then resume the action as though nothing had happened.

Very cool, except....

Well, the good news is that this is fast and easy. The bad news is that we can't change the location of the still frame.

So, here's another way to do this.

Put the playhead (or skimmer, but I prefer the playhead) on the frame you want to freeze, select the clip, then type Shift+F.

![Playhead](https://images.wondershare.com/multimedia/speed005.jpg)

This locates the source clip in the Browser, selects both the Browser and the clip, and matches the position of the In, Out, and playhead.

![match clips](https://images.wondershare.com/multimedia/speed006.jpg)

Now, with the Browser selected, type Option+F. This creates a freeze-frame of the Browser clip and places it at the location of the playhead as a connected clip in the Timeline.

As a connected clip, we can move this new freeze-frame wherever we want. However, be careful in moving the clip, because, unless you mark the original frame with a marker (type "M"), there's no easy way to match the still frame with the source frame, once the still frame is moved somewhere else.

I use both these techniques in many different projects.

#### 2\.  HOLD FRAME

A Hold Frame is similar to an in-line still frame, but with more flexibility.

![hold frame](https://images.wondershare.com/multimedia/speed013.jpg)

Put the playhead (or skimmer) on the frame you want to hold. Then, Then, using either Modify > Retime or the "Smurf-on-a-headset" Toolbar icon, choose Hold Frame (or type: Shift+H).

![hold frames in fcp x](https://images.wondershare.com/multimedia/speed014.jpg)

This displays the orange Retime editor bar above the clip, with a small red portion indicating the Hold frame.

![create hold frames](https://images.wondershare.com/multimedia/speed015.jpg)

Change the duration of the Hold frame by dragging the small thumb at the right end of the red bar.

![speed016](https://images.wondershare.com/multimedia/speed016.jpg)

Add a speed ramp transition at the end of the Hold frame by clicking the downward-pointing arrow next to the word "Hold" in the Retime Editor.

![speed018](https://images.wondershare.com/multimedia/speed018.jpg)

To change the actual frame being held, double-click the bar icon to the LEFT of the red Hold section and choose Source Frame (Edit). This allows you to slide the Hold frame selection left or right.

NOTE: Changing the source frame is a feature that I like a LOT!

#### 3\.  SLOW (or FAST) MOTION

![fast/slow motion](https://images.wondershare.com/multimedia/speed007.jpg)

We use slow-motion to show events that are too fast for the unaided eye to see. And fast motion to speed up very slow events. Both of these effects use what's called a "constant speed change," where the entire clip changes by the same amount - either faster or slower.

WE create either effect using the same tools, just different values. Here's how.

![slow motion](https://images.wondershare.com/multimedia/speed008.jpg)

Select the clip who's speed you want to change. Then, using either Modify > Retime or the "Smurf" Toolbar icon, select Slow (or Fast).

Choose one of the available speeds; in this case, 50%. (Yes, you can change this to any value you want, I'll show you how in a minute.)

![create slow/fast motion](https://images.wondershare.com/multimedia/speed009.jpg)

Three things happen at once:

* The duration of the clip changes
* The orange Retiming bar appears over the top of the clip
* The speed of the clip changes

![speed010](https://images.wondershare.com/multimedia/speed010.jpg)

To reset the speed back to normal (100%), click the downward-pointing arrow in the Retiming bar and choose Normal (100%).

There are two ways to change the speed of a clip.

![speed017](https://images.wondershare.com/multimedia/speed017.jpg)

The easy way is to grab the small handle at the end of the clip and drag left or right. The speed will change as you drag it.

Or, for more precision, click the downward-pointing arrow in the Retiming bar and choose Custom.

![speed011](https://images.wondershare.com/multimedia/speed011.jpg)

* Reverse. Plays the clip in reverse.
* Rate. Select a specific speed change as a percentage of normal speed for a clip. Less than 100% is slow-motion. More than 100% is fast-motion.

## The Ultimate List of Free Online Face Generators for Fun and Creativity

While signing up for a social media account, you may not want to use your real photograph as your profile picture, but at the same time, you might not find it ethical to use someone else’s image either. This is where a **face generation portal** comes into play. You can easily **create a virtual face** that looks almost like you and sometimes even better with a face generator.

Similarly, run a business where you want to publish your clients’ reviews without showing their real photos as they might not like the idea. You can use a good face generator online tool to create a virtual face that resembles their look and post it along with their feedback.

Considering the above scenarios and many others that may come up over time, the following list some of the best free online face generators to create fake faces.

## Best Free Online Face Generators to Get Virtual Faces in 2022

### 1\. Generated Photos: Faces

**Website**: <https://generated.photos/faces>

This online portal enables you to create virtual faces by specifying the physical attributes of a character, such as gender, age, hair color, eye color, and much more. You can be as creative as you want to generate a face that appears somewhat like you with the available options. Once a look is generated, you can download and use it as needed.

The steps that are given below explain how you can use Generated Photos’ Faces section to create and download a virtual face:

* Launch your favorite web browser and go to the URL given above, and then you will see all free AI-generated photos on this website.

![generated photos layout](https://images.wondershare.com/filmora/article-images/generated-photos-layout.jpg)

* Use the filters given in the left pane to define your character's physical attributes and click **Apply** from the bottom to get the results. You can customize the face from its head post, gender, age, hair, eye, and emotion aspects.
* Click your preferred character from the AI-generated faces, and then click **Download** from the page that opens next. Choose your preferred method to sign up, and then sign in to download the virtual face to your PC.

### 2\. Generated Photos: Anonymizer

**Website**: <https://generated.photos/anonymizer>

Anonymizer is another section from the Generated Photos portal that allows you to upload your image. Then it uses AI technology to generate similar virtual faces that you can download and use wherever needed.

However, sometimes the pictures that the website creates may not resemble your face as closely as you expect them to be, but that’s OK. Isn’t it? The main idea is to keep your privacy intact, and that’s what Generated Photos: Anonymizer does.

You can learn how to use this section by following the instructions given below:

* Use the URL given above to get to the Anonymizer’s web page and then click **Upload photo;**
* Select and upload your photo from your PC to the portal and wait while Anonymizer uses AI to generate similar faces.
* Click the photo that you want to use, and when the next page opens up, click Sign up or sign in to download the photo and use it wherever needed

![recreate face with anonymizer online face generators](https://images.wondershare.com/filmora/article-images/recreate-face-with-anonymizer-online-face-generators.jpg)

### 3\. Generated Photos Face Generator

Website: [](https://generated.photos/face-generator)<https://generated.photos/face-generator>

This online face generator from Generated Photos allows you to create a unique realt-time face from scratch in one click. And if you don’t like the face generated, you can change the parameters such as gender, skin tone, hair, eye and head pose.

Generated Photos Face Generator tool is a good choice for people who don’t want to upload any photos online, and need to customize the face at maximum.

Below is a brief tutorial about how to generate a face with it step by step:

* Go to the website give above and then click the **Generate faces**
* Select the parameters accordingly based on your needs. You can generate the same face young or old with different emotions.

![generated photos face generator online](https://images.wondershare.com/filmora/article-images/generated-photos-face-generator-online.jpg)

You can then download the generated photo by signing up or logging in, but you need to pay to remove the watermark.

### 4\. Massless

**Website:** [https://massless.io/tool/face-maker-ai](https://massless.io/tool/face-maker-ai/)

Massless allows you to use its tools to sketch a portrait, and then it uses AI technology to generate a virtual face out of your drawing. However, because you can’t always be precise while sketching with the mouse, it would be good to have access to a digital drawing pad to create the faces with a pen. With Massless, you can explore your creativity to the full and draw beautiful faces to use them as your avatar.

You can follow the procedure given below to use Massless to draw virtual faces:

* Open a web browser, and visit the URL given above. Click any icons from the toolbox at the top (E.g., **Nose**).
* Draw a shape on its corresponding face area on the left (E.g., **Nose**), and wait while the portal automatically updates the photo on the right.
* Repeat the process to sketch other parts of the face, and click the More icon (with three vertical dots) from the top-right corner.
* Click **Download images** from the page that opens next to download the photo to your PC and use it wherever needed.

![massless online face generator](https://images.wondershare.com/filmora/article-images/massless-online-face-generator.jpg)

### 5\. This Person Does Not Exist

**Website:** <https://thispersondoesnotexist.com/>

This free online virtual face generator is probably the easiest and quickest. As you go to the website, it displays a random realistic image of a person that may not exist. If you don’t like the idea, you can change it with merely a single mouse click. Because the portal doesn’t have any Download button at the time of this writing, you must rely on the web browser’s default downloading process to get the image to your PC.

You can follow the instructions that are given below to switch between the images and download the one you like:

* Use your preferred web browser (Google Chrome here) to visit the URL provided above, and then notice the random image that appears on the page;
* Click **Another** from the box that appears at the bottom-right corner to change the image, repeat this process until you find a good photo for your avatar, and then right-click anywhere on the image.
* Click **Save image** from the context menu to save the photo. And then go to the default download folder to access the downloaded image, and use the picture wherever needed.

**Note:** Different browsers may have this feature with other names

![thispersondoesnotexist free online face generators](https://images.wondershare.com/filmora/article-images/thispersondoesnotexist-free-online-face-generators.jpg)

### 6\. BoredHumans

**Website**: <https://boredhumans.com/faces.php>

This web portal is identical to the previous one as it generates random virtual faces with merely one mouse click. Even this website doesn’t have any Download button to help you download the image. Therefore, you must use the browser’s built-in feature to obtain the photo you want to save to your PC.

You can learn how to use BoredHumans to generate virtual faces and download them to your computer by following the steps given below:

* Open a web browser (Google Chrome here) and visit the URL provided above, and then click **Generate Another Fake Human** if you don’t like the one that appears;
* Keep clicking the button until you find a face that can be used as your avatar. Alternatively, you can click the **Generate A Human** button to create a less realistic image of a random person.

![free online face generators boredhumans](https://images.wondershare.com/filmora/article-images/free-online-face-generators-boredhumans.jpg)

* Right-click the image and click **Save image** to download the photo to your PC; and then get to the default download location to access the photo and use it wherever needed.

### 7\. faceMaker

**Website**: <https://facemaker.uvrg.org/>

faceMaker allows you to generate virtual faces out of the fine details that you specify during the creation process. These details are adjusted using the sliders that affect the corresponding physical attributes of the avatars. For example, you can modify the lips, eye color, hair, face roundness, mouse depth, jaw shape, etc. using their respective sliders.

You can follow the steps that are given below to learn how to create a virtual face using faceMaker, and save it to your PC to use it as an avatar:

* Use your preferred web browser to visit the URL given above and click **Start** from the main page.
* Fill out the questionnaire by choosing your preferred options and agreeing to the term and conditions.
* Click **Start** and then click **Continue** on the next page. Use the sliders on the left and right panels to customize the face as needed, and once done, you can use any screen capturing tool to take a snapshot and remove the sliders by cropping the image, thus having only the virtual face.

![free online face generators facemaker](https://images.wondershare.com/filmora/article-images/free-online-face-generators-facemaker.jpg)

* Save the cropped photo on your PC, and then back on the webpage, click **Finished** from the bottom-right corner.

![facemaker online face generators face](https://images.wondershare.com/filmora/article-images/facemaker-online-face-generators-face.jpg)

* On the next page, choose the radio buttons according to your choice. Once done, click **Yes, submit now** from the bottom to submit the customized virtual face to the portal.

![download facemaker online face generators face](https://images.wondershare.com/filmora/article-images/download-facemaker-online-face-generators-face.jpg)

**Conclusion**

With all the cybercrime reports circulating everywhere nowadays, it is important to stay cautious about what you post on any social media website. To add an extra layer of security, you can avoid using your real photograph as a profile picture, and go with the fake faces instead. You can generate these virtual faces using any of the free online face generator websites, some of which even allow you to define the shape of a face quite minutely. Because the generated faces are not of any real human, they can be used as your avatar without any risk.
