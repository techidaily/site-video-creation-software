<p>The above steps can be used to <strong>change aspect ratio MP4</strong> as well as all other popular formats.</p>
<p>Step 4. After the video settings are done you can process it and save it at the desired location.</p>

We’ve decided to go very simple with this list, providing a brief description of all of the FREE <strong>MP3 Converters</strong> (<strong>Windows</strong>), a URL that will lead you to the website where you can get the converter, and an image that should show you how the converter’s interface looks like.</p>
<h3 id="01EaseUs-MobiMover"><a href="#01EaseUs-MobiMover" class="headerlink" title="01EaseUs MobiMover"></a>01<strong>EaseUs MobiMover</strong></h3><p>EaseUs MobiMover is an <strong>audio converter for Windows 10</strong> and 11 that you can use in order to easily convert videos (in various formats) into MP3 (as is shown in the image below. It’s a FREEmium software though — which means that it’s use is limited until you purchase the paid version of the software.</p>

<h3 id="02Freemake-Video-Converter"><a href="#02Freemake-Video-Converter" class="headerlink" title="02Freemake Video Converter"></a>02<strong>Freemake Video Converter</strong></h3><p>Freemake Video Converter is the first 100% FREE <strong>MP3 converter for Windows 10</strong> on this list! They keep the software updated from donations, so you can choose how much money you can spare for using the service! It’s a very simple software besides (as is shown in the image below). It does feature some video editing tools, but its main function is conversion (which includes video-to-audio conversion!)</p>

<h3 id="03VSDC"><a href="#03VSDC" class="headerlink" title="03VSDC"></a>03<strong>VSDC</strong></h3><p>Much like Freemake, our next <strong>MP3 converter for Windows 10</strong> and 11, called VSDC, is completely FREE — as they run primarily on donations. That does mean that it’s not the most advanced program though — evident from the rather old-school interface (shown in the image below). But, regardless of the lack of abundance in tools, it should function just fine as an <strong>audio-video-converter for Windows 10</strong> (and vice versa.)</p>

<h3 id="04Convertio-co"><a href="#04Convertio-co" class="headerlink" title="04Convertio.co"></a>04<strong>Convertio.co</strong></h3><p>With Convertio.co, we break the mold a bit! This is not a software, but it does still work for Windows users — as it requires only that you have a working browser from which you can access the website (URL linked below!) As you can see from the image, it works much like most online MP3 converters — you upload a file from your desktop, wait for it to finish converting, and then download it!</p>

                ></p>
<h3 id="05Free-Convert"><a href="#05Free-Convert" class="headerlink" title="05Free Convert"></a>05<strong>Free Convert</strong></h3><p>Free Convert is another online <strong>MP3 convert for Windows 10</strong> users that would prefer not to download or install software. And, just like Covertio, it works by uploading the files you want to convert from your computer, waiting for the converters tool to finish converting it, and then downloading the finished product. It is, of course, FREE — but, similar to the first tool on this list, if you want to unlock some of its features, you’ll have to pay for the premium version.</p>

<h3 id="06DVDVideoSoft"><a href="#06DVDVideoSoft" class="headerlink" title="06DVDVideoSoft"></a>06<strong>DVDVideoSoft</strong></h3><p>With DVDVideoSoft, we’re back to an <strong>audio-video converter for Windows 10</strong> that you have to download and install to work! It’s a FREEmium software too. That means that you’ll have to pay in order to unlock certain features. But, it works as a solid converter even without that.</p>

This list will be a little more detailed than the first, since there are many differences between the tools that we’ll be introducing (both FREE and PAID), but it should give you a clear idea on which would work best for you.</p>
<h3 id="01Wondershare-Filmora"><a href="#01Wondershare-Filmora" class="headerlink" title="01Wondershare Filmora"></a>01<strong>Wondershare Filmora</strong></h3><p>Operating System: Windows&#x2F;Mac</p>
<p>Today’s Best Deals: US$89.99 (one-time)</p>
<p>The first on our list is the <strong>MP3 editor Windows 10</strong> and Mac compatible, <a class="link"   target="_blank" rel="noopener" href="https://tools.techidaily.com/wondershare/filmora/download/" >Wondershare Filmora Video Editor <i class="fa-regular fa-arrow-up-right-from-square fa-sm"></i></a> This is an advanced video editing software that you can use in order to work on just about any digital project — including, of course, editing your MP3 audio files.</p>
<p><strong>Reasons to Buy:</strong></p>
<p><strong>●</strong> Lots of editing tools for MP3 files</p>
<p><strong>●</strong> Exports high-quality end-products</p>
<p><strong>●</strong> FREE to try, multiple-packages available</p>
<p><strong>Reasons to Avoid:</strong></p>
<p><strong>●</strong> Premium software (subscription&#x2F;one-time fee)</p>

<p>Today’s Best Deals: FREE</p>
<p>Audacity is an <strong>MP3 editor (Windows 10</strong>, Max, and Linux compatible!) The difference between this tool and our first pick, Filmora Pro, is that Audacity is an open-source software — this means that it is free to use, but it also means that it might not be the most reliable as it is not updated quite as often.</p>
<p><strong>Reasons to Buy:</strong></p>
<p><strong>●</strong> FREE, open-source software</p>
<p><strong>●</strong> Advanced video and audio editing tools</p>
<p><strong>●</strong> MP3 trimming&#x2F;cutting feature</p>
<p><strong>Reasons to Avoid:</strong></p>
<p><strong>●</strong> Not updated as often</p>
<p><strong>●</strong> Confusing interface</p>
<p><strong>●</strong> Difficult to use for beginners</p>

<p>Today’s Best Deals: US$29.99</p>
<p>Next up is Ashampoo’s Music Studio 8! Here’s another freemium software that you can try for free — just to make sure it’s the tool that you’re looking for, but you’ll have to pay a price to use in its entirety! As you can see from the interface (shown in the image below) though, it’s quite the effective <strong>MP3 cutter for Windows 10</strong> (among other things). So, if that’s what you’re looking for, then it’s a good choice to consider.</p>
<p><strong>Reasons to Buy:</strong></p>
<p><strong>●</strong> Clean, modern interface</p>
<p><strong>●</strong> Beginner-friendly editing tools</p>
<p><strong>●</strong> One-time fee only</p>
<p><strong>Reasons to Avoid:</strong></p>
<p><strong>●</strong> Freemium software (one-time payment required)</p>

<p>Today’s Best Deals: FREE</p>
<p>As far as audio-editing goes, you’re probably going to have a difficult time finding one that is as specialized as Ocenaudio. As you can probably guess from the name, it is, primarily, an audio editing tool. Making it a good choice if that’s all you’re looking for in a software, as it certainly keeps things simpler.</p>
<p><strong>Reasons to Buy:</strong></p>
<p><strong>●</strong> Beginner-friendly audio editor</p>
<p><strong>●</strong> Simple, clean interface</p>
<p><strong>●</strong> Available for Windows&#x2F;Mac&#x2F;Linux</p>

<p>Today’s Best Deals: FREE</p>
<p>Our next pick is another open-source, <strong>MP3 editor for Windows 10</strong>. It’s called Acoustica. And, as you can see from the image shared below, it’s a fairly advanced audio editing tool. You should note, however, that the newer versions of this product are PAID (only older models are free), which is the topic of our discussion today.</p>
<p><strong>Reasons to Buy:</strong></p>
<p><strong>●</strong> FREE, open-source product</p>

<p>Finally, we finish things off with Audiotool, it’s certainly not your traditional audio editor (as is evident from the image shown below). But, the funky interface doesn’t mean that it won’t work for you! You never know, it might be exactly the kind that helps you zoom through your projects more quickly.</p>
<p><strong>Reasons to Buy:</strong></p>
<p><strong>●</strong> FREE, open-source software</p>
<p><strong>●</strong> Available for Windows&#x2F;Mac&#x2F;Linux users</p>

This is a straightforward list, much like the first. And, we’ll be focusing on <strong>MP3 players for Windows 10</strong> only (although some of these will work for Mac as well!)</p>
<h3 id="01iTunes"><a href="#01iTunes" class="headerlink" title="01iTunes"></a>01<strong>iTunes</strong></h3><p>Despite appearances, iTunes actually makes for a great <strong>MP3 player for Windows 10</strong> users. After all, it’s interface is clean and it is regularly updated. So, you never have to deal with bugs! (And just in case you weren’t aware, you can add your own original audio to your iTunes library! So, it isn’t like you have to purchase media from the iTunes store just to listen to it.)</p>

                ></p>
<h3 id="02Groove-Music"><a href="#02Groove-Music" class="headerlink" title="02Groove Music"></a>02<strong>Groove Music</strong></h3><p>Groove Music is a local <strong>Mp3 player for Windows 10</strong> that you can download from the Microsoft App Store. It functions much like iTunes — in that you can add original music or audio to the app library (as well as purchase audio from the store — if that’s what you want.)</p>

<h3 id="03Macgo-Media-Player"><a href="#03Macgo-Media-Player" class="headerlink" title="03Macgo Media Player"></a>03<strong>Macgo Media Player</strong></h3><p>Our next pick, Macgo, is not strictly an <strong>MP3 player for Windows 10</strong>, but it can work for that purpose if that’s all you need it for. As a media player though, it does function as a video player as well. And, like our previous picks, it’s FREE so you don’t have to worry about paying in order to use it.</p>

<h3 id="04PowerDVD"><a href="#04PowerDVD" class="headerlink" title="04PowerDVD"></a>04<strong>PowerDVD</strong></h3><p>Again, our next pick is more of a general media player than strictly a <strong>MP3 Player for Windows 10</strong> users, but it works just as well if all you’re looking for is to occasionally play the audio that you’ve converted or trimmed!</p>

The best part of this app is, undoubtedly, the fact that it has several view options. So, if you want, you have your audio playing from a mini audio player (rather than the full interface — as is shown below). It’s also useful for organizing your media collection!</p>

(Note, a lot of the audio editors that we introduced in Part 2 of this article should be capable of this! And, they all work in much the same way.)</p>

<p>For this example, we’ll be using Joyoshare Media Cutter. And, the way to start is to select the “Open” button, which will prompt you to choose which audio you want to cut.</p>

<h3 id="01EaseUs-MobiMover-1"><a href="#01EaseUs-MobiMover-1" class="headerlink" title="01EaseUs MobiMover"></a>01<strong>EaseUs MobiMover</strong></h3><p>EaseUs MobiMover is an <strong>audio converter for Windows 10</strong> and 11 that you can use in order to easily convert videos (in various formats) into MP3 (as is shown in the image below.

They keep the software updated from donations, so you can choose how much money you can spare for using the service! It’s a very simple software besides (as is shown in the image below). It does feature some video editing tools, but its main function is conversion (which includes video-to-audio conversion!)</p>

That does mean that it’s not the most advanced program though — evident from the rather old-school interface (shown in the image below). But, regardless of the lack of abundance in tools, it should function just fine as an <strong>audio-video-converter for Windows 10</strong> (and vice versa.)</p>

This is not a software, but it does still work for Windows users — as it requires only that you have a working browser from which you can access the website (URL linked below!) As you can see from the image, it works much like most online MP3 converters — you upload a file from your desktop, wait for it to finish converting, and then download it!</p>

<h3 id="05Free-Convert-1"><a href="#05Free-Convert-1" class="headerlink" title="05Free Convert"></a>05<strong>Free Convert</strong></h3><p>Free Convert is another online <strong>MP3 convert for Windows 10</strong> users that would prefer not to download or install software. And, just like Covertio, it works by uploading the files you want to convert from your computer, waiting for the converters tool to finish converting it, and then downloading the finished product. It is, of course, FREE — but, similar to the first tool on this list, if you want to unlock some of its features, you’ll have to pay for the premium version.</p>

<p>Today’s Best Deals: FREE</p>
<p>Audacity is an <strong>MP3 editor (Windows 10</strong>, Max, and Linux compatible!) The difference between this tool and our first pick, Filmora Pro, is that Audacity is an open-source software — this means that it is free to use, but it also means that it might not be the most reliable as it is not updated quite as often.</p>
<p><strong>Reasons to Buy:</strong></p>
<p><strong>●</strong> FREE, open-source software</p>

Here’s another freemium software that you can try for free — just to make sure it’s the tool that you’re looking for, but you’ll have to pay a price to use in its entirety! As you can see from the interface (shown in the image below) though, it’s quite the effective <strong>MP3 cutter for Windows 10</strong> (among other things). So, if that’s what you’re looking for, then it’s a good choice to consider.</p>

<p>As far as audio-editing goes, you’re probably going to have a difficult time finding one that is as specialized as Ocenaudio.

This is a straightforward list, much like the first. And, we’ll be focusing on <strong>MP3 players for Windows 10</strong> only (although some of these will work for Mac as well!)</p>
<h3 id="01iTunes-1"><a href="#01iTunes-1" class="headerlink" title="01iTunes"></a>01<strong>iTunes</strong></h3><p>Despite appearances, iTunes actually makes for a great <strong>MP3 player for Windows 10</strong> users. After all, it’s interface is clean and it is regularly updated. So, you never have to deal with bugs! (And just in case you weren’t aware, you can add your own original audio to your iTunes library! So, it isn’t like you have to purchase media from the iTunes store just to listen to it.)</p>

<h3 id="02Groove-Music-1"><a href="#02Groove-Music-1" class="headerlink" title="02Groove Music"></a>02<strong>Groove Music</strong></h3><p>Groove Music is a local <strong>Mp3 player for Windows 10</strong> that you can download from the Microsoft App Store. It functions much like iTunes — in that you can add original music or audio to the app library (as well as purchase audio from the store — if that’s what you want.)</p>

<h3 id="03Macgo-Media-Player-1"><a href="#03Macgo-Media-Player-1" class="headerlink" title="03Macgo Media Player"></a>03<strong>Macgo Media Player</strong></h3><p>Our next pick, Macgo, is not strictly an <strong>MP3 player for Windows 10</strong>, but it can work for that purpose if that’s all you need it for. As a media player though, it does function as a video player as well. And, like our previous picks, it’s FREE so you don’t have to worry about paying in order to use it.</p>

                ></p>
<h3 id="04PowerDVD-1"><a href="#04PowerDVD-1" class="headerlink" title="04PowerDVD"></a>04<strong>PowerDVD</strong></h3><p>Again, our next pick is more of a general media player than strictly a <strong>MP3 Player for Windows 10</strong> users, but it works just as well if all you’re looking for is to occasionally play the audio that you’ve converted or trimmed!</p>
<p><img  
                     lazyload

                ></p>
<h3 id="05Musicbee-1"><a href="#05Musicbee-1" class="headerlink" title="05Musicbee"></a>05<strong>Musicbee</strong></h3><p>We’re back to strictly <strong>MP3 players for Windows</strong> with Musicbee! The best part of this app is, undoubtedly, the fact that it has several view options. So, if you want, you have your audio playing from a mini audio player (rather than the full interface — as is shown below). It’s also useful for organizing your media collection!</p>

(Note, a lot of the audio editors that we introduced in Part 2 of this article should be capable of this! And, they all work in much the same way.)</p>

Start!"></a>01<strong>Step 1: Launch MP3 Cutter for Windows 10! Start!</strong></h3><p>First, launch the <strong>MP3 cutter for Windows 10</strong> that you downloaded.</p>
<p>For this example, we’ll be using Joyoshare Media Cutter. And, the way to start is to select the “Open” button, which will prompt you to choose which audio you want to cut.</p>

(Most <strong>MP3 cutters for Windows 10</strong> offers a variety for you to choose from).</p>

The first is the select and trim mode, which is shown in the image below! For this, you use the sliders provider to select which portion of the audio you want to keep!</p>

This will allow you to pinpoint the best place to cut your audio!</p>

<p>With Joyoshare, the method of doing this is to select the “Start” button, which will prompt the trimmer to begin cutting the audio.</p>

<h2 id="Key-Takeaways-from-This-Episode-5"><a href="#Key-Takeaways-from-This-Episode-5" class="headerlink" title="Key Takeaways from This Episode"></a>Key Takeaways from This Episode</h2><p><strong>●</strong> There are multiple <strong>MP3 converters for Windows</strong> and Mac that you can use in order to convert videos to an audio file that you can use for certain projects.</p>
<p><strong>●</strong> Of course, if you want your finished project to sound clean, you’ll probably need a functional audio editor for that! And, for this matter, we recommend advanced video editing software like Filmora Pro.</p>
<p><strong>●</strong> Just in case you want to review what your converted audio sounds like, consider one of the audio players that are available for Windows and Mac!</p>
<p><strong>●</strong> If you find that your audio needs some trimming, a quick trim with an audio cutter should do the trick. It’s very simple to do!</p>

We’ve decided to go very simple with this list, providing a brief description of all of the FREE <strong>MP3 Converters</strong> (<strong>Windows</strong>), a URL that will lead you to the website where you can get the converter, and an image that should show you how the converter’s interface looks like.</p>
<h3 id="01EaseUs-MobiMover-2"><a href="#01EaseUs-MobiMover-2" class="headerlink" title="01EaseUs MobiMover"></a>01<strong>EaseUs MobiMover</strong></h3><p>EaseUs MobiMover is an <strong>audio converter for Windows 10</strong> and 11 that you can use in order to easily convert videos (in various formats) into MP3 (as is shown in the image below. It’s a FREEmium software though — which means that it’s use is limited until you purchase the paid version of the software.</p>

<h3 id="02Freemake-Video-Converter-2"><a href="#02Freemake-Video-Converter-2" class="headerlink" title="02Freemake Video Converter"></a>02<strong>Freemake Video Converter</strong></h3><p>Freemake Video Converter is the first 100% FREE <strong>MP3 converter for Windows 10</strong> on this list! They keep the software updated from donations, so you can choose how much money you can spare for using the service! It’s a very simple software besides (as is shown in the image below). It does feature some video editing tools, but its main function is conversion (which includes video-to-audio conversion!)</p>

<h3 id="03VSDC-2"><a href="#03VSDC-2" class="headerlink" title="03VSDC"></a>03<strong>VSDC</strong></h3><p>Much like Freemake, our next <strong>MP3 converter for Windows 10</strong> and 11, called VSDC, is completely FREE — as they run primarily on donations. That does mean that it’s not the most advanced program though — evident from the rather old-school interface (shown in the image below). But, regardless of the lack of abundance in tools, it should function just fine as an <strong>audio-video-converter for Windows 10</strong> (and vice versa.)</p>

<h3 id="04Convertio-co-2"><a href="#04Convertio-co-2" class="headerlink" title="04Convertio.co"></a>04<strong>Convertio.co</strong></h3><p>With Convertio.co, we break the mold a bit! This is not a software, but it does still work for Windows users — as it requires only that you have a working browser from which you can access the website (URL linked below!) As you can see from the image, it works much like most online MP3 converters — you upload a file from your desktop, wait for it to finish converting, and then download it!</p>

<h3 id="05Free-Convert-2"><a href="#05Free-Convert-2" class="headerlink" title="05Free Convert"></a>05<strong>Free Convert</strong></h3><p>Free Convert is another online <strong>MP3 convert for Windows 10</strong> users that would prefer not to download or install software. And, just like Covertio, it works by uploading the files you want to convert from your computer, waiting for the converters tool to finish converting it, and then downloading the finished product. It is, of course, FREE — but, similar to the first tool on this list, if you want to unlock some of its features, you’ll have to pay for the premium version.</p>

It’s a FREEmium software too. That means that you’ll have to pay in order to unlock certain features. But, it works as a solid converter even without that.</p>

<p>Today’s Best Deals: FREE</p>
<p>Audacity is an <strong>MP3 editor (Windows 10</strong>, Max, and Linux compatible!) The difference between this tool and our first pick, Filmora Pro, is that Audacity is an open-source software — this means that it is free to use, but it also means that it might not be the most reliable as it is not updated quite as often.</p>
<p><strong>Reasons to Buy:</strong></p>
<p><strong>●</strong> FREE, open-source software</p>

<p><strong>Reasons to Avoid:</strong></p>
<p><strong>●</strong> Not updated as often</p>

<p>Our next pick is another open-source, <strong>MP3 editor for Windows 10</strong>. It’s called Acoustica. And, as you can see from the image shared below, it’s a fairly advanced audio editing tool.

<p>Today’s Best Deals: FREE</p>
<p>Finally, we finish things off with Audiotool, it’s certainly not your traditional audio editor (as is evident from the image shown below).

This is a straightforward list, much like the first. And, we’ll be focusing on <strong>MP3 players for Windows 10</strong> only (although some of these will work for Mac as well!)</p>
<h3 id="01iTunes-2"><a href="#01iTunes-2" class="headerlink" title="01iTunes"></a>01<strong>iTunes</strong></h3><p>Despite appearances, iTunes actually makes for a great <strong>MP3 player for Windows 10</strong> users. After all, it’s interface is clean and it is regularly updated. So, you never have to deal with bugs! (And just in case you weren’t aware, you can add your own original audio to your iTunes library! So, it isn’t like you have to purchase media from the iTunes store just to listen to it.)</p>

<h3 id="02Groove-Music-2"><a href="#02Groove-Music-2" class="headerlink" title="02Groove Music"></a>02<strong>Groove Music</strong></h3><p>Groove Music is a local <strong>Mp3 player for Windows 10</strong> that you can download from the Microsoft App Store. It functions much like iTunes — in that you can add original music or audio to the app library (as well as purchase audio from the store — if that’s what you want.)</p>

<h3 id="03Macgo-Media-Player-2"><a href="#03Macgo-Media-Player-2" class="headerlink" title="03Macgo Media Player"></a>03<strong>Macgo Media Player</strong></h3><p>Our next pick, Macgo, is not strictly an <strong>MP3 player for Windows 10</strong>, but it can work for that purpose if that’s all you need it for. As a media player though, it does function as a video player as well. And, like our previous picks, it’s FREE so you don’t have to worry about paying in order to use it.</p>

<h3 id="04PowerDVD-2"><a href="#04PowerDVD-2" class="headerlink" title="04PowerDVD"></a>04<strong>PowerDVD</strong></h3><p>Again, our next pick is more of a general media player than strictly a <strong>MP3 Player for Windows 10</strong> users, but it works just as well if all you’re looking for is to occasionally play the audio that you’ve converted or trimmed!</p>

<h3 id="05Musicbee-2"><a href="#05Musicbee-2" class="headerlink" title="05Musicbee"></a>05<strong>Musicbee</strong></h3><p>We’re back to strictly <strong>MP3 players for Windows</strong> with Musicbee! The best part of this app is, undoubtedly, the fact that it has several view options. So, if you want, you have your audio playing from a mini audio player (rather than the full interface — as is shown below). It’s also useful for organizing your media collection!</p>

(Note, a lot of the audio editors that we introduced in Part 2 of this article should be capable of this! And, they all work in much the same way.)</p>

This will allow you to pinpoint the best place to cut your audio!</p>

They keep the software updated from donations, so you can choose how much money you can spare for using the service! It’s a very simple software besides (as is shown in the image below). It does feature some video editing tools, but its main function is conversion (which includes video-to-audio conversion!)</p>

<h3 id="03VSDC-3"><a href="#03VSDC-3" class="headerlink" title="03VSDC"></a>03<strong>VSDC</strong></h3><p>Much like Freemake, our next <strong>MP3 converter for Windows 10</strong> and 11, called VSDC, is completely FREE — as they run primarily on donations. That does mean that it’s not the most advanced program though — evident from the rather old-school interface (shown in the image below). But, regardless of the lack of abundance in tools, it should function just fine as an <strong>audio-video-converter for Windows 10</strong> (and vice versa.)</p>

This is not a software, but it does still work for Windows users — as it requires only that you have a working browser from which you can access the website (URL linked below!) As you can see from the image, it works much like most online MP3 converters — you upload a file from your desktop, wait for it to finish converting, and then download it!</p>

<h3 id="05Free-Convert-3"><a href="#05Free-Convert-3" class="headerlink" title="05Free Convert"></a>05<strong>Free Convert</strong></h3><p>Free Convert is another online <strong>MP3 convert for Windows 10</strong> users that would prefer not to download or install software. And, just like Covertio, it works by uploading the files you want to convert from your computer, waiting for the converters tool to finish converting it, and then downloading the finished product. It is, of course, FREE — but, similar to the first tool on this list, if you want to unlock some of its features, you’ll have to pay for the premium version.</p>

<h3 id="06DVDVideoSoft-3"><a href="#06DVDVideoSoft-3" class="headerlink" title="06DVDVideoSoft"></a>06<strong>DVDVideoSoft</strong></h3><p>With DVDVideoSoft, we’re back to an <strong>audio-video converter for Windows 10</strong> that you have to download and install to work! It’s a FREEmium software too. That means that you’ll have to pay in order to unlock certain features. But, it works as a solid converter even without that.</p>

<p>Today’s Best Deals: FREE</p>
<p>Audacity is an <strong>MP3 editor (Windows 10</strong>, Max, and Linux compatible!) The difference between this tool and our first pick, Filmora Pro, is that Audacity is an open-source software — this means that it is free to use, but it also means that it might not be the most reliable as it is not updated quite as often.</p>

<p><strong>●</strong> FREE, open-source software</p>

Here’s another freemium software that you can try for free — just to make sure it’s the tool that you’re looking for, but you’ll have to pay a price to use in its entirety! As you can see from the interface (shown in the image below) though, it’s quite the effective <strong>MP3 cutter for Windows 10</strong> (among other things). So, if that’s what you’re looking for, then it’s a good choice to consider.</p>
<p><strong>Reasons to Buy:</strong></p>

<p>Today’s Best Deals: FREE</p>
<p>As far as audio-editing goes, you’re probably going to have a difficult time finding one that is as specialized as Ocenaudio.

<p>Our next pick is another open-source, <strong>MP3 editor for Windows 10</strong>. It’s called Acoustica. And, as you can see from the image shared below, it’s a fairly advanced audio editing tool.

<p>Finally, we finish things off with Audiotool, it’s certainly not your traditional audio editor (as is evident from the image shown below). But, the funky interface doesn’t mean that it won’t work for you! You never know, it might be exactly the kind that helps you zoom through your projects more quickly.</p>

This is a straightforward list, much like the first. And, we’ll be focusing on <strong>MP3 players for Windows 10</strong> only (although some of these will work for Mac as well!)</p>
<h3 id="01iTunes-3"><a href="#01iTunes-3" class="headerlink" title="01iTunes"></a>01<strong>iTunes</strong></h3><p>Despite appearances, iTunes actually makes for a great <strong>MP3 player for Windows 10</strong> users. After all, it’s interface is clean and it is regularly updated. So, you never have to deal with bugs! (And just in case you weren’t aware, you can add your own original audio to your iTunes library! So, it isn’t like you have to purchase media from the iTunes store just to listen to it.)</p>

<h3 id="02Groove-Music-3"><a href="#02Groove-Music-3" class="headerlink" title="02Groove Music"></a>02<strong>Groove Music</strong></h3><p>Groove Music is a local <strong>Mp3 player for Windows 10</strong> that you can download from the Microsoft App Store. It functions much like iTunes — in that you can add original music or audio to the app library (as well as purchase audio from the store — if that’s what you want.)</p>

As a media player though, it does function as a video player as well. And, like our previous picks, it’s FREE so you don’t have to worry about paying in order to use it.</p>

<h3 id="04PowerDVD-3"><a href="#04PowerDVD-3" class="headerlink" title="04PowerDVD"></a>04<strong>PowerDVD</strong></h3><p>Again, our next pick is more of a general media player than strictly a <strong>MP3 Player for Windows 10</strong> users, but it works just as well if all you’re looking for is to occasionally play the audio that you’ve converted or trimmed!</p>

<h3 id="05Musicbee-3"><a href="#05Musicbee-3" class="headerlink" title="05Musicbee"></a>05<strong>Musicbee</strong></h3><p>We’re back to strictly <strong>MP3 players for Windows</strong> with Musicbee! The best part of this app is, undoubtedly, the fact that it has several view options. So, if you want, you have your audio playing from a mini audio player (rather than the full interface — as is shown below). It’s also useful for organizing your media collection!</p>

<p>Thanks to strong Internet connections, faster processing technology, and Cloud computing, there are now hundreds of free online video trimmer websites.</p>
<p>Yet, it is difficult to figure out which is the best and which is the worst. Some are just awful, and others are a little suspicious and&#x2F;or malicious.</p>
<p>If you are struggling to figure out which online video trimmer is for you, then here is a list of the 10+ best free online video trimmers.</p>
<h2 id="Why-Free-Online-Video-Trimmers"><a href="#Why-Free-Online-Video-Trimmers" class="headerlink" title="Why Free Online Video Trimmers?"></a>Why Free Online Video Trimmers?</h2><p>Why would anybody use free “Online” video trimmers when there are so many good offline (downloadable) trimmers a person can use? Windows even has its own installed video trimmer. Simply right click your video, navigate to “Open With” and then click on “Photos.” At the top right of the GUI is an icon called “Edit &amp; Create.” Click it and it takes you to the editing function where you may trim your video.</p>
<p>The sad part is that the pre-installed video editor for Windows is just like the one for Mac. It is slow to process, it is very basic, and it doesn’t allow you to edit frame-by-frame. As a result, most people prefer a free online video trimmer as opposed to a pre-installed tool or third-party video trimmer app.</p>

<p>The WonderShare Filmora program is littered with features you can use if you are willing to download its program and use it on your device. It has a free version that you can download, but what most people do not know is that it has a video trimmer online.</p>
<p>The <a class="link"   target="_blank" rel="noopener" href="https://tools.techidaily.com/wondershare/filmora/download/" >free online video trimmer <i class="fa-regular fa-arrow-up-right-from-square fa-sm"></i></a> allows you to upload a video, and then edit it within your web browser. Once your video is uploaded, you are able to edit and trim it in minutes. You may also change the output format. You may set the video trim using the manual tool that allows you to look at your video as it plays. Or, you may use the start and end function and simply enter the starting position and finishing position.</p>
<p>Exporting and downloading is very easy, and there is no obligation to buy one of their other tools. The odd thing is that most people do not know this service is even available. Most people think that the website is simply full of editing tools. Most are unaware there are any free online tools.</p>
<p>Just like many users known, Wondershare has a desktop video editor for Windows and Mac that is very easy and simple to use, named <strong>Filmora</strong>. it’s very powerful for beginners. You can download it for free now.</p>

<p>The name may be a little uninspired, but the video cutter is not a bad online tool. It is nestled in between a series of other simple online tools such as a voice recorder, file converter and so forth. You do not need to download this tool. You start by clicking the “Open File” button.</p>
<p>Pick the video you wish to trim, and then wait for it to upload. It takes a while to upload your video because the servers are not great. Once the video is uploaded, you are able to use the simple tools the website has to offer in order to trim your video.</p>
<p>There is a bit of advertising on the website, but mostly the web master is hoping for donations to keep the website running. Since the website doesn’t make much money, it cannot afford to pay for better bandwidth or better servers, which is why it sometimes takes quite a while to upload, trim, and then download. But, it is free, so it is difficult to complain.</p>

<p>Contrary to popular opinion, the YouTube video trimmer tools are pretty poor quality. But, they ride high on this list because of their amazing server speeds and storage capacity. There are plenty of video editors that will cut out if you try to upload larger files, but the YouTube Creator Studio will not.</p>
<p>YouTube has billions of dollars behind it because it is owned by Google. A common problem with online video trimmers is that they take too long to upload and download. That is still a problem with the YouTube system, but it is still one of the fastest uploading and downloading video tools on the Internet.</p>
<p>Another problem with other online trimmers is that it is difficult to upload large videos. Many online trimmers will freeze or crash, which means all the uploading was for nothing. But, the YouTube system will not crash or freeze. You simply leave your computer alone, and eventually it will upload your file (even large files). For these reasons, the YouTube Creator Studios tool rides pretty high up this list.</p>

                ></p>
<p>The Video Toolbox system sits on a very cheaply made website that is pretty darn ugly. But, this tool reaches the number four position because it is rather more advanced than one has come to expect from a free video trimmer and editor.</p>
<p>The tool is free, and it can process video files of up to 1500MB, which is not a massive amount, but it is about the size of three episodes of the Simpsons. This tool can convert your video files to a wide range of other file types. You may also alter the bit rate, audio codec, video codex, frame rate, sample rate and channels.</p>
<p>This tool also comes with online features that allow you to re-download your previous videos, see your recent file outputs, and delete your log files. It is also able to pull items from your videos such as meta data, subtitle files, and so forth. Plus, the tool allows you to merge videos and crop videos with just a few clicks.</p>

                      alt="free online video trimmer"
                ></p>
<p>The WeVideo tool is an online editor. It is a video trimmer windows compatible program that will run off of your Edge web browser. The tool is pretty easy to use, it is fairly fast and flexible. The sad part is that this tool offers a series of seemingly perfect tool functions, but it asks for money for them.</p>
<p>For example, the video trimmer is free, but the green-screen tool is not. They always ask you to turn your free account into a paid account, which is very annoying. Yet, this tool reaches number five on this list because the GUI for the video trimmer is great, and the level of support for this system is pretty good too.</p>
<h4 id="7-Wincreator-Video-Cutter"><a href="#7-Wincreator-Video-Cutter" class="headerlink" title="7. Wincreator Video Cutter"></a>7. <a class="link"   target="_blank" rel="noopener" href="http://www.wincreator.com/video-cutter" >Wincreator Video Cutter <i class="fa-regular fa-arrow-up-right-from-square fa-sm"></i></a></h4><p><img

                      alt="free online video trimmer"
                ></p>
<p>This video editor is another video trimmer free service. The GUI is pretty ugly, but it is the sort of simple tool that gets to the point and gets there pretty quickly. The biggest downside is that the free video trimmer will only accept up to 50MB of data. This is not very much. It is the sort of amount you may upload to Instagram.</p>
<p>The tool is very lightweight, which means the pages are less likely to crash or freeze. It also means that the editor loads quickly and doesn’t lag as you use it. If other editors were this simple, then far fewer people would feel the need to download video trimming software.</p>
<h4 id="8-Kizoa"><a href="#8-Kizoa" class="headerlink" title="8. Kizoa"></a>8. <a class="link"   target="_blank" rel="noopener" href="https://www.kizoa.com/Video-Editor" >Kizoa <i class="fa-regular fa-arrow-up-right-from-square fa-sm"></i></a></h4><p>This is a fully featured multi-faceted tool for editing videos. It offers a great deal of functions that allow you to trim your videos and edit them in a variety of ways. The sad part is that this tool is very well presented on the website, but most of the tools are locked behind a paywall. They nag users to pay their one-time fee, or to join their premium membership.</p>
<p>If you are looking to trim your videos, then this is a good place for uploading and trimming 4K videos. It also allows you to share videos, and if you pay, then you can store RAW videos. The online movie editor and movie maker allow you to trim your videos frame-by-frame. This is perfect for people who need precision when they are trimming their videos. It is also the sort of tool that more advanced users may enjoy.</p>
<h4 id="9-Aconvert-Video-Cutter"><a href="#9-Aconvert-Video-Cutter" class="headerlink" title="9. Aconvert Video Cutter"></a>9. <a class="link"   target="_blank" rel="noopener" href="https://www.aconvert.com/video/split/" >Aconvert Video Cutter <i class="fa-regular fa-arrow-up-right-from-square fa-sm"></i></a></h4><p><img

                      alt="free online video trimmer"
                ></p>
<p>This is possibly one of the simplest tools on this list, which is good in most cases, but some may need a little more in order to do a good job. There is however a function that offers a little more flexibility than other tools. Once your video is uploaded, you can choose a different output file from over ten different file types.</p>
<p>You can specify which part of the video you wish to cut prior to uploading. This saves a lot of processing time when the video is uploaded, which is probably going to suit people who have a lot of small videos to cut and who do not want to wait around for the website to respond. You are able to upload up to 200MB, which is not great, but it is also not terrible. It is around the size of four music videos, or a mobile-episode of a US sitcom.</p>
<h4 id="10-Clip-Champ"><a href="#10-Clip-Champ" class="headerlink" title="10. Clip Champ"></a>10. <a class="link"   target="_blank" rel="noopener" href="https://clipchamp.com/en/video-editor" >Clip Champ <i class="fa-regular fa-arrow-up-right-from-square fa-sm"></i></a></h4><p><img

                      alt="free online video trimmer"
                ></p>
<p>This tool has a very user-friendly interface. It has the sort of simple interface that beats out websites like SnapChat, WhatsApp and so forth. The website that hosts the tool says that you do not need experience to use their editing tools, and that is probably true. The biggest downside to this tool, and the reason it sits on the number nine spot, is that they will not let you use the tool without signing in.</p>
<p>It may not seem like such a big deal to have to sign into an account, but it is just for marketing purposes. It also allows them to sell you other services that they offer. If you are only looking to trim your videos, then there are far simpler ways to do it through the online trimmers listed in this article.</p>
<p>If you are looking for more of an online editor, then maybe you should consider the Clip Champ. Suffice it to say that this is not the best tool for quick and simple video trims because there are other tools listed on this article that are much faster.</p>

                      alt="free online video trimmer"
                ></p>
<p>This is a great tool with a fairly simple interface. You can see your videos as you trim them. And, you can edit your videos, gone their settings, add text, and so forth. Yet, it is only their simplest functions that are for free. The trimming function is free, but many of the editing tools are not.</p>
<p>This would not normally be a problem, but this website is always dangling its other products and its prices in front of you. If you are just looking to trim a file, then the adverts for their services can become annoying. The tool renders and works well on web browsers, so it may be of interest to people who are willing to pay for semi-professional editing tools.</p>
<h2 id="Conclusion-Which-Suits-You-the-Best"><a href="#Conclusion-Which-Suits-You-the-Best" class="headerlink" title="Conclusion - Which Suits You the Best?"></a>Conclusion - Which Suits You the Best?</h2><p>There are tools on this article for most types of trimming jobs. There are tools that will quickly upload and process your smaller videos, which is suitable for people making social media videos. Then, there are tools that will take a large and bulky file, and are good for people who are very conscious about the file output and video quality.</p>
<p>It is a pity that some of these tools ask for money to use their other editing services. But, if you want to trim your videos for free, then all of these tools on this article will help you.</p>

<p>Pick the video you wish to trim, and then wait for it to upload. It takes a while to upload your video because the servers are not great. Once the video is uploaded, you are able to use the simple tools the website has to offer in order to trim your video.</p>
<p>There is a bit of advertising on the website, but mostly the web master is hoping for donations to keep the website running. Since the website doesn’t make much money, it cannot afford to pay for better bandwidth or better servers, which is why it sometimes takes quite a while to upload, trim, and then download. But, it is free, so it is difficult to complain.</p>

<p>Contrary to popular opinion, the YouTube video trimmer tools are pretty poor quality. But, they ride high on this list because of their amazing server speeds and storage capacity. There are plenty of video editors that will cut out if you try to upload larger files, but the YouTube Creator Studio will not.</p>
<p>YouTube has billions of dollars behind it because it is owned by Google. A common problem with online video trimmers is that they take too long to upload and download. That is still a problem with the YouTube system, but it is still one of the fastest uploading and downloading video tools on the Internet.</p>
<p>Another problem with other online trimmers is that it is difficult to upload large videos. Many online trimmers will freeze or crash, which means all the uploading was for nothing. But, the YouTube system will not crash or freeze. You simply leave your computer alone, and eventually it will upload your file (even large files). For these reasons, the YouTube Creator Studios tool rides pretty high up this list.</p>

<p>The Video Toolbox system sits on a very cheaply made website that is pretty darn ugly. But, this tool reaches the number four position because it is rather more advanced than one has come to expect from a free video trimmer and editor.</p>
<p>The tool is free, and it can process video files of up to 1500MB, which is not a massive amount, but it is about the size of three episodes of the Simpsons. This tool can convert your video files to a wide range of other file types. You may also alter the bit rate, audio codec, video codex, frame rate, sample rate and channels.</p>
<p>This tool also comes with online features that allow you to re-download your previous videos, see your recent file outputs, and delete your log files. It is also able to pull items from your videos such as meta data, subtitle files, and so forth. Plus, the tool allows you to merge videos and crop videos with just a few clicks.</p>

<p>The WeVideo tool is an online editor. It is a video trimmer windows compatible program that will run off of your Edge web browser. The tool is pretty easy to use, it is fairly fast and flexible. The sad part is that this tool offers a series of seemingly perfect tool functions, but it asks for money for them.</p>
<p>For example, the video trimmer is free, but the green-screen tool is not. They always ask you to turn your free account into a paid account, which is very annoying. Yet, this tool reaches number five on this list because the GUI for the video trimmer is great, and the level of support for this system is pretty good too.</p>

                ></p>
<p>This video editor is another video trimmer free service. The GUI is pretty ugly, but it is the sort of simple tool that gets to the point and gets there pretty quickly. The biggest downside is that the free video trimmer will only accept up to 50MB of data. This is not very much. It is the sort of amount you may upload to Instagram.</p>
<p>The tool is very lightweight, which means the pages are less likely to crash or freeze. It also means that the editor loads quickly and doesn’t lag as you use it. If other editors were this simple, then far fewer people would feel the need to download video trimming software.</p>

It offers a great deal of functions that allow you to trim your videos and edit them in a variety of ways. The sad part is that this tool is very well presented on the website, but most of the tools are locked behind a paywall. They nag users to pay their one-time fee, or to join their premium membership.</p>
<p>If you are looking to trim your videos, then this is a good place for uploading and trimming 4K videos. It also allows you to share videos, and if you pay, then you can store RAW videos. The online movie editor and movie maker allow you to trim your videos frame-by-frame. This is perfect for people who need precision when they are trimming their videos. It is also the sort of tool that more advanced users may enjoy.</p>

<p>This is possibly one of the simplest tools on this list, which is good in most cases, but some may need a little more in order to do a good job. There is however a function that offers a little more flexibility than other tools. Once your video is uploaded, you can choose a different output file from over ten different file types.</p>
<p>You can specify which part of the video you wish to cut prior to uploading. This saves a lot of processing time when the video is uploaded, which is probably going to suit people who have a lot of small videos to cut and who do not want to wait around for the website to respond. You are able to upload up to 200MB, which is not great, but it is also not terrible. It is around the size of four music videos, or a mobile-episode of a US sitcom.</p>

                ></p>
<p>This tool has a very user-friendly interface. It has the sort of simple interface that beats out websites like SnapChat, WhatsApp and so forth. The website that hosts the tool says that you do not need experience to use their editing tools, and that is probably true. The biggest downside to this tool, and the reason it sits on the number nine spot, is that they will not let you use the tool without signing in.</p>
<p>It may not seem like such a big deal to have to sign into an account, but it is just for marketing purposes. It also allows them to sell you other services that they offer. If you are only looking to trim your videos, then there are far simpler ways to do it through the online trimmers listed in this article.</p>
<p>If you are looking for more of an online editor, then maybe you should consider the Clip Champ. Suffice it to say that this is not the best tool for quick and simple video trims because there are other tools listed on this article that are much faster.</p>

<p>This is a great tool with a fairly simple interface. You can see your videos as you trim them. And, you can edit your videos, gone their settings, add text, and so forth. Yet, it is only their simplest functions that are for free. The trimming function is free, but many of the editing tools are not.</p>
<p>This would not normally be a problem, but this website is always dangling its other products and its prices in front of you. If you are just looking to trim a file, then the adverts for their services can become annoying. The tool renders and works well on web browsers, so it may be of interest to people who are willing to pay for semi-professional editing tools.</p>
<h2 id="Conclusion-Which-Suits-You-the-Best-1"><a href="#Conclusion-Which-Suits-You-the-Best-1" class="headerlink" title="Conclusion - Which Suits You the Best?"></a>Conclusion - Which Suits You the Best?</h2><p>There are tools on this article for most types of trimming jobs. There are tools that will quickly upload and process your smaller videos, which is suitable for people making social media videos. Then, there are tools that will take a large and bulky file, and are good for people who are very conscious about the file output and video quality.</p>
<p>It is a pity that some of these tools ask for money to use their other editing services. But, if you want to trim your videos for free, then all of these tools on this article will help you.</p>

<p>Thanks to strong Internet connections, faster processing technology, and Cloud computing, there are now hundreds of free online video trimmer websites.</p>
<p>Yet, it is difficult to figure out which is the best and which is the worst. Some are just awful, and others are a little suspicious and&#x2F;or malicious.</p>
<p>If you are struggling to figure out which online video trimmer is for you, then here is a list of the 10+ best free online video trimmers.</p>
<h2 id="Why-Free-Online-Video-Trimmers-2"><a href="#Why-Free-Online-Video-Trimmers-2" class="headerlink" title="Why Free Online Video Trimmers?"></a>Why Free Online Video Trimmers?</h2><p>Why would anybody use free “Online” video trimmers when there are so many good offline (downloadable) trimmers a person can use? Windows even has its own installed video trimmer. Simply right click your video, navigate to “Open With” and then click on “Photos.” At the top right of the GUI is an icon called “Edit &amp; Create.” Click it and it takes you to the editing function where you may trim your video.</p>
<p>The sad part is that the pre-installed video editor for Windows is just like the one for Mac. It is slow to process, it is very basic, and it doesn’t allow you to edit frame-by-frame. As a result, most people prefer a free online video trimmer as opposed to a pre-installed tool or third-party video trimmer app.</p>
<h2 id="10-Best-Free-Online-Video-Trimmers-2"><a href="#10-Best-Free-Online-Video-Trimmers-2" class="headerlink" title="10+ Best Free Online Video Trimmers"></a>10+ Best Free Online Video Trimmers</h2><p>There are many reasons why online trimmers are preferred. Many times, the sorts of video trimmers one downloads are full of malware, bloatware, and ransomware. Even the ones that claim to be clean have suspicious obvious security holes.</p>
<p>Another common reason is that many online trimmers allow trimming and conversions in formats, file types, and resolutions that downloadable programs do not. Also, even the world’s best free downloadable video trimmer <a class="link"   target="_blank" rel="noopener" href="https://www.blender.org/" >Blender.org <i class="fa-regular fa-arrow-up-right-from-square fa-sm"></i></a>, is so viciously complicated that one would need weeks of tutorials just to figure out how to use it.</p>
<p>In many cases, the simplest and most straight-forwards answer is to use an online trimmer. To quickly upload, trim, convert, maybe add effects, and then download. It is quicker, easier, and often runs a smaller risk of security breaches, ID theft, and malware problems.</p>
<p>So in this part, I review the 10+ best online video trimmers that are easy to use for beginners and those who just need a few of cuts. Among them on the top is video cutter from Wondershare.</p>

<p>The WonderShare Filmora program is littered with features you can use if you are willing to download its program and use it on your device. It has a free version that you can download, but what most people do not know is that it has a video trimmer online.</p>
<p>The <a class="link"   target="_blank" rel="noopener" href="https://tools.techidaily.com/wondershare/filmora/download/" >free online video trimmer <i class="fa-regular fa-arrow-up-right-from-square fa-sm"></i></a> allows you to upload a video, and then edit it within your web browser. Once your video is uploaded, you are able to edit and trim it in minutes. You may also change the output format. You may set the video trim using the manual tool that allows you to look at your video as it plays. Or, you may use the start and end function and simply enter the starting position and finishing position.</p>
<p>Exporting and downloading is very easy, and there is no obligation to buy one of their other tools. The odd thing is that most people do not know this service is even available. Most people think that the website is simply full of editing tools. Most are unaware there are any free online tools.</p>
<p>Just like many users known, Wondershare has a desktop video editor for Windows and Mac that is very easy and simple to use, named <strong>Filmora</strong>. it’s very powerful for beginners. You can download it for free now.</p>

<p>This video editor is another video trimmer free service. The GUI is pretty ugly, but it is the sort of simple tool that gets to the point and gets there pretty quickly. The biggest downside is that the free video trimmer will only accept up to 50MB of data. This is not very much. It is the sort of amount you may upload to Instagram.</p>
<p>The tool is very lightweight, which means the pages are less likely to crash or freeze. It also means that the editor loads quickly and doesn’t lag as you use it. If other editors were this simple, then far fewer people would feel the need to download video trimming software.</p>

<p>This is possibly one of the simplest tools on this list, which is good in most cases, but some may need a little more in order to do a good job. There is however a function that offers a little more flexibility than other tools. Once your video is uploaded, you can choose a different output file from over ten different file types.</p>
<p>You can specify which part of the video you wish to cut prior to uploading. This saves a lot of processing time when the video is uploaded, which is probably going to suit people who have a lot of small videos to cut and who do not want to wait around for the website to respond. You are able to upload up to 200MB, which is not great, but it is also not terrible. It is around the size of four music videos, or a mobile-episode of a US sitcom.</p>

<p>This is a great tool with a fairly simple interface. You can see your videos as you trim them. And, you can edit your videos, gone their settings, add text, and so forth. Yet, it is only their simplest functions that are for free. The trimming function is free, but many of the editing tools are not.</p>
<p>This would not normally be a problem, but this website is always dangling its other products and its prices in front of you. If you are just looking to trim a file, then the adverts for their services can become annoying. The tool renders and works well on web browsers, so it may be of interest to people who are willing to pay for semi-professional editing tools.</p>

<p>Thanks to strong Internet connections, faster processing technology, and Cloud computing, there are now hundreds of free online video trimmer websites.</p>
<p>Yet, it is difficult to figure out which is the best and which is the worst. Some are just awful, and others are a little suspicious and&#x2F;or malicious.</p>
<p>If you are struggling to figure out which online video trimmer is for you, then here is a list of the 10+ best free online video trimmers.</p>
<h2 id="Why-Free-Online-Video-Trimmers-3"><a href="#Why-Free-Online-Video-Trimmers-3" class="headerlink" title="Why Free Online Video Trimmers?"></a>Why Free Online Video Trimmers?</h2><p>Why would anybody use free “Online” video trimmers when there are so many good offline (downloadable) trimmers a person can use? Windows even has its own installed video trimmer. Simply right click your video, navigate to “Open With” and then click on “Photos.” At the top right of the GUI is an icon called “Edit &amp; Create.” Click it and it takes you to the editing function where you may trim your video.</p>
<p>The sad part is that the pre-installed video editor for Windows is just like the one for Mac. It is slow to process, it is very basic, and it doesn’t allow you to edit frame-by-frame. As a result, most people prefer a free online video trimmer as opposed to a pre-installed tool or third-party video trimmer app.</p>
<h2 id="10-Best-Free-Online-Video-Trimmers-3"><a href="#10-Best-Free-Online-Video-Trimmers-3" class="headerlink" title="10+ Best Free Online Video Trimmers"></a>10+ Best Free Online Video Trimmers</h2><p>There are many reasons why online trimmers are preferred. Many times, the sorts of video trimmers one downloads are full of malware, bloatware, and ransomware. Even the ones that claim to be clean have suspicious obvious security holes.</p>
<p>Another common reason is that many online trimmers allow trimming and conversions in formats, file types, and resolutions that downloadable programs do not. Also, even the world’s best free downloadable video trimmer <a class="link"   target="_blank" rel="noopener" href="https://www.blender.org/" >Blender.org <i class="fa-regular fa-arrow-up-right-from-square fa-sm"></i></a>, is so viciously complicated that one would need weeks of tutorials just to figure out how to use it.</p>
<p>In many cases, the simplest and most straight-forwards answer is to use an online trimmer. To quickly upload, trim, convert, maybe add effects, and then download. It is quicker, easier, and often runs a smaller risk of security breaches, ID theft, and malware problems.</p>
<p>So in this part, I review the 10+ best online video trimmers that are easy to use for beginners and those who just need a few of cuts. Among them on the top is video cutter from Wondershare.</p>

<p>The WonderShare Filmora program is littered with features you can use if you are willing to download its program and use it on your device. It has a free version that you can download, but what most people do not know is that it has a video trimmer online.</p>
<p>The <a class="link"   target="_blank" rel="noopener" href="https://tools.techidaily.com/wondershare/filmora/download/" >free online video trimmer <i class="fa-regular fa-arrow-up-right-from-square fa-sm"></i></a> allows you to upload a video, and then edit it within your web browser. Once your video is uploaded, you are able to edit and trim it in minutes. You may also change the output format. You may set the video trim using the manual tool that allows you to look at your video as it plays. Or, you may use the start and end function and simply enter the starting position and finishing position.</p>
<p>Exporting and downloading is very easy, and there is no obligation to buy one of their other tools. The odd thing is that most people do not know this service is even available. Most people think that the website is simply full of editing tools. Most are unaware there are any free online tools.</p>
<p>Just like many users known, Wondershare has a desktop video editor for Windows and Mac that is very easy and simple to use, named <strong>Filmora</strong>. it’s very powerful for beginners. You can download it for free now.</p>

<p>The name may be a little uninspired, but the video cutter is not a bad online tool. It is nestled in between a series of other simple online tools such as a voice recorder, file converter and so forth. You do not need to download this tool. You start by clicking the “Open File” button.</p>
<p>Pick the video you wish to trim, and then wait for it to upload. It takes a while to upload your video because the servers are not great. Once the video is uploaded, you are able to use the simple tools the website has to offer in order to trim your video.</p>
<p>There is a bit of advertising on the website, but mostly the web master is hoping for donations to keep the website running. Since the website doesn’t make much money, it cannot afford to pay for better bandwidth or better servers, which is why it sometimes takes quite a while to upload, trim, and then download. But, it is free, so it is difficult to complain.</p>

<p>Contrary to popular opinion, the YouTube video trimmer tools are pretty poor quality. But, they ride high on this list because of their amazing server speeds and storage capacity. There are plenty of video editors that will cut out if you try to upload larger files, but the YouTube Creator Studio will not.</p>
<p>YouTube has billions of dollars behind it because it is owned by Google. A common problem with online video trimmers is that they take too long to upload and download. That is still a problem with the YouTube system, but it is still one of the fastest uploading and downloading video tools on the Internet.</p>
<p>Another problem with other online trimmers is that it is difficult to upload large videos. Many online trimmers will freeze or crash, which means all the uploading was for nothing. But, the YouTube system will not crash or freeze. You simply leave your computer alone, and eventually it will upload your file (even large files). For these reasons, the YouTube Creator Studios tool rides pretty high up this list.</p>

<p>The Video Toolbox system sits on a very cheaply made website that is pretty darn ugly. But, this tool reaches the number four position because it is rather more advanced than one has come to expect from a free video trimmer and editor.</p>
<p>The tool is free, and it can process video files of up to 1500MB, which is not a massive amount, but it is about the size of three episodes of the Simpsons. This tool can convert your video files to a wide range of other file types. You may also alter the bit rate, audio codec, video codex, frame rate, sample rate and channels.</p>
<p>This tool also comes with online features that allow you to re-download your previous videos, see your recent file outputs, and delete your log files. It is also able to pull items from your videos such as meta data, subtitle files, and so forth. Plus, the tool allows you to merge videos and crop videos with just a few clicks.</p>

<p>The WeVideo tool is an online editor. It is a video trimmer windows compatible program that will run off of your Edge web browser. The tool is pretty easy to use, it is fairly fast and flexible. The sad part is that this tool offers a series of seemingly perfect tool functions, but it asks for money for them.</p>
<p>For example, the video trimmer is free, but the green-screen tool is not. They always ask you to turn your free account into a paid account, which is very annoying. Yet, this tool reaches number five on this list because the GUI for the video trimmer is great, and the level of support for this system is pretty good too.</p>

Below are the summarized steps of creating a professional lyric video in Wondershare Filmora video editor.</p>
<p><strong>Step 1: Add and edit music in the timeline</strong></p>
<p>Since we are going to make a lyric video, let’s import the audio track to the timeline first, add the fade-in or fade-out effect to make it smoother if needed.</p>
<p><img  
                     lazyload
                     src="/images/loading.svg"
                     data-src="https://images.wondershare.com/filmora/article-images/add-music-to-filmora-timeline.jpg"
                      alt="Add music to Filmora Timeline"
                ></p>
<p><strong>Step</strong> <strong>2: Choose Sample Color background</strong></p>
<p>After launching Filmora, go to the Sample Color category under the Media tab, and you will find many sample colors to choose from. Drag and drop one into the timeline.</p>
<p><img  
                     lazyload
                     src="/images/loading.svg"
                     data-src="https://images.wondershare.com/filmora/article-images/filmora-sample-color-library.jpg"
                      alt=" Filmora sample color library"
                ></p>
<p><strong>Step 3:</strong> <strong>Add and customize texts to the lyric video</strong></p>
<p>Filmora video editor offers a wide variety of pre-written content and lets the creators drag and drop to see how it looks, with no need for editing or other typical copywriting tasks. Go to the Titles tab, drag the desired text over to the sample color video track. Here, we prefer to use a default title</p>
<p><img  
                     lazyload
                     src="/images/loading.svg"
                     data-src="https://images.wondershare.com/filmora/article-images/customize-lyric-titles-filmora.jpg"
                      alt=" Filmora customize lyrics"
                ></p>
<p>Double click the titles in the timeline to customize the texts, fonts, colors, or animations. Click the Advanced button for a new window pops up where you can add a title box and do more customization. Such as giving the titles individual animation.</p>
<p><strong>Step 4: Add effects for texts</strong></p>
<p><img  
                     lazyload
                     src="/images/loading.svg"
                     data-src="https://images.wondershare.com/filmora/article-images/add-mild-effects-to-lyric-video.jpg"
                      alt=" add mile effects to  lyrics"
                ></p>
<p>To make the whole title dynamic, we can add some effects to the texts. Go to the Effects tab and then click on mild effects to put the mild effects to the text. Right-click the Mild effect and go to Properties to change its frequency and positions if needed.</p>
<p> <strong>Step</strong> <strong>5: Add</strong> <strong>transitions to texts</strong></p>
<p>Filmora video editor provides lots of transitions for playing the video smoother. Go to the Transitions tab and choose one and place it between each title to make the lyric video vivid.</p>
<p><img  
                     lazyload
                     src="/images/loading.svg"

You can enjoy listening to the music and reading the exact lyrics of the song by viewing a lyric video. You should know that a lyric video is totally different from a karaoke video. The professionals can create creative and engaging lyric videos to grab the attention of their viewers</p>
<p>You can follow these tips to make good lyric videos:</p>
<p><strong>Accuracy</strong></p>
<p>You should make sure that there is 100% accuracy in the lyric video you are creating. If there are wrong lyrics on any of your lyric videos, your followers may not prefer watching your other lyric videos. So, double-check or triple-check the lyrics before sharing them with your fans.</p>
<p><strong>Theme&#x2F;Background</strong></p>
<p>You should pick an attractive theme for creating an engaging video. No doubt, a video having a central theme attracts the viewers a lot.</p>
<p><strong>Color</strong></p>
<p>You should select an efficient and eye-catching color scheme for your lyric video. That is because it is helpful in elevating the visual appeal of the video, which in turn gains the attention of the viewers.</p>
<p><strong>Fonts</strong></p>
<p>A lyric video is all about fonts because the viewers are interested in reading the lyrics. So, you should select interesting fonts and should focus on font style, size, and color. The fonts should sync in with the video’s vibe so that the viewer can enjoy watching it.</p>
<p><strong>Transitions&#x2F;Filters</strong></p>
<p>You should use filters that could blend with the song’s vibe. Choose the transitions that look natural and appealing. Never bombard your video with too many transitions and filters.</p>

Below are the summarized steps of creating a professional lyric video in Wondershare Filmora video editor.</p>
<p><strong>Step 1: Add and edit music in the timeline</strong></p>
<p>Since we are going to make a lyric video, let’s import the audio track to the timeline first, add the fade-in or fade-out effect to make it smoother if needed.</p>
<p><img  
                     lazyload
                     src="/images/loading.svg"
                     data-src="https://images.wondershare.com/filmora/article-images/add-music-to-filmora-timeline.jpg"
                      alt="Add music to Filmora Timeline"
                ></p>
<p><strong>Step</strong> <strong>2: Choose Sample Color background</strong></p>
<p>After launching Filmora, go to the Sample Color category under the Media tab, and you will find many sample colors to choose from. Drag and drop one into the timeline.</p>
<p><img  
                     lazyload
                     src="/images/loading.svg"
                     data-src="https://images.wondershare.com/filmora/article-images/filmora-sample-color-library.jpg"
                      alt=" Filmora sample color library"
                ></p>
<p><strong>Step 3:</strong> <strong>Add and customize texts to the lyric video</strong></p>
<p>Filmora video editor offers a wide variety of pre-written content and lets the creators drag and drop to see how it looks, with no need for editing or other typical copywriting tasks. Go to the Titles tab, drag the desired text over to the sample color video track. Here, we prefer to use a default title</p>
<p><img  
                     lazyload
                     src="/images/loading.svg"
                     data-src="https://images.wondershare.com/filmora/article-images/customize-lyric-titles-filmora.jpg"
                      alt=" Filmora customize lyrics"
                ></p>
<p>Double click the titles in the timeline to customize the texts, fonts, colors, or animations. Click the Advanced button for a new window pops up where you can add a title box and do more customization. Such as giving the titles individual animation.</p>
<p><strong>Step 4: Add effects for texts</strong></p>
<p><img

                     src="/images/loading.svg"
                     data-src="https://images.wondershare.com/filmora/article-images/add-mild-effects-to-lyric-video.jpg"
                      alt=" add mile effects to  lyrics"
                ></p>
<p>To make the whole title dynamic, we can add some effects to the texts. Go to the Effects tab and then click on mild effects to put the mild effects to the text. Right-click the Mild effect and go to Properties to change its frequency and positions if needed.</p>
<p> <strong>Step</strong> <strong>5: Add</strong> <strong>transitions to texts</strong></p>
<p>Filmora video editor provides lots of transitions for playing the video smoother. Go to the Transitions tab and choose one and place it between each title to make the lyric video vivid.</p>
<p><img  
                     lazyload

You can enjoy listening to the music and reading the exact lyrics of the song by viewing a lyric video. You should know that a lyric video is totally different from a karaoke video. The professionals can create creative and engaging lyric videos to grab the attention of their viewers</p>
<p>You can follow these tips to make good lyric videos:</p>
<p><strong>Accuracy</strong></p>
<p>You should make sure that there is 100% accuracy in the lyric video you are creating. If there are wrong lyrics on any of your lyric videos, your followers may not prefer watching your other lyric videos. So, double-check or triple-check the lyrics before sharing them with your fans.</p>
<p><strong>Theme&#x2F;Background</strong></p>
<p>You should pick an attractive theme for creating an engaging video. No doubt, a video having a central theme attracts the viewers a lot.</p>
<p><strong>Color</strong></p>
<p>You should select an efficient and eye-catching color scheme for your lyric video. That is because it is helpful in elevating the visual appeal of the video, which in turn gains the attention of the viewers.</p>
<p><strong>Fonts</strong></p>
<p>A lyric video is all about fonts because the viewers are interested in reading the lyrics. So, you should select interesting fonts and should focus on font style, size, and color. The fonts should sync in with the video’s vibe so that the viewer can enjoy watching it.</p>
<p><strong>Transitions&#x2F;Filters</strong></p>
<p>You should use filters that could blend with the song’s vibe. Choose the transitions that look natural and appealing. Never bombard your video with too many transitions and filters.</p>

Below are the summarized steps of creating a professional lyric video in Wondershare Filmora video editor.</p>
<p><strong>Step 1: Add and edit music in the timeline</strong></p>
<p>Since we are going to make a lyric video, let’s import the audio track to the timeline first, add the fade-in or fade-out effect to make it smoother if needed.</p>
<p><img  
                     lazyload
                     src="/images/loading.svg"
                     data-src="https://images.wondershare.com/filmora/article-images/add-music-to-filmora-timeline.jpg"
                      alt="Add music to Filmora Timeline"
                ></p>
<p><strong>Step</strong> <strong>2: Choose Sample Color background</strong></p>
<p>After launching Filmora, go to the Sample Color category under the Media tab, and you will find many sample colors to choose from. Drag and drop one into the timeline.</p>
<p><img  
                     lazyload
                     src="/images/loading.svg"
                     data-src="https://images.wondershare.com/filmora/article-images/filmora-sample-color-library.jpg"
                      alt=" Filmora sample color library"
                ></p>
<p><strong>Step 3:</strong> <strong>Add and customize texts to the lyric video</strong></p>
<p>Filmora video editor offers a wide variety of pre-written content and lets the creators drag and drop to see how it looks, with no need for editing or other typical copywriting tasks. Go to the Titles tab, drag the desired text over to the sample color video track. Here, we prefer to use a default title</p>
<p><img  
                     lazyload
                     src="/images/loading.svg"
                     data-src="https://images.wondershare.com/filmora/article-images/customize-lyric-titles-filmora.jpg"
                      alt=" Filmora customize lyrics"
                ></p>
<p>Double click the titles in the timeline to customize the texts, fonts, colors, or animations. Click the Advanced button for a new window pops up where you can add a title box and do more customization. Such as giving the titles individual animation.</p>
<p><strong>Step 4: Add effects for texts</strong></p>
<p><img  
                     lazyload
                     src="/images/loading.svg"
                     data-src="https://images.wondershare.com/filmora/article-images/add-mild-effects-to-lyric-video.jpg"
                      alt=" add mile effects to  lyrics"
                ></p>
<p>To make the whole title dynamic, we can add some effects to the texts. Go to the Effects tab and then click on mild effects to put the mild effects to the text. Right-click the Mild effect and go to Properties to change its frequency and positions if needed.</p>
<p> <strong>Step</strong> <strong>5: Add</strong> <strong>transitions to texts</strong></p>
<p>Filmora video editor provides lots of transitions for playing the video smoother. Go to the Transitions tab and choose one and place it between each title to make the lyric video vivid.</p>
<p><img  
                     lazyload
                     src="/images/loading.svg"

You can enjoy listening to the music and reading the exact lyrics of the song by viewing a lyric video. You should know that a lyric video is totally different from a karaoke video. The professionals can create creative and engaging lyric videos to grab the attention of their viewers</p>
<p>You can follow these tips to make good lyric videos:</p>
<p><strong>Accuracy</strong></p>
<p>You should make sure that there is 100% accuracy in the lyric video you are creating. If there are wrong lyrics on any of your lyric videos, your followers may not prefer watching your other lyric videos. So, double-check or triple-check the lyrics before sharing them with your fans.</p>
<p><strong>Theme&#x2F;Background</strong></p>
<p>You should pick an attractive theme for creating an engaging video. No doubt, a video having a central theme attracts the viewers a lot.</p>
<p><strong>Color</strong></p>
<p>You should select an efficient and eye-catching color scheme for your lyric video. That is because it is helpful in elevating the visual appeal of the video, which in turn gains the attention of the viewers.</p>
<p><strong>Fonts</strong></p>
<p>A lyric video is all about fonts because the viewers are interested in reading the lyrics. So, you should select interesting fonts and should focus on font style, size, and color. The fonts should sync in with the video’s vibe so that the viewer can enjoy watching it.</p>
<p><strong>Transitions&#x2F;Filters</strong></p>
<p>You should use filters that could blend with the song’s vibe. Choose the transitions that look natural and appealing. Never bombard your video with too many transitions and filters.</p>

The platform has various tools that provide you with different ways to make engaging lyric videos. Below are the summarized steps of creating a professional lyric video in Wondershare Filmora video editor.</p>
<p><strong>Step 1: Add and edit music in the timeline</strong></p>
<p>Since we are going to make a lyric video, let’s import the audio track to the timeline first, add the fade-in or fade-out effect to make it smoother if needed.</p>
<p><img  
                     lazyload
                     src="/images/loading.svg"
                     data-src="https://images.wondershare.com/filmora/article-images/add-music-to-filmora-timeline.jpg"
                      alt="Add music to Filmora Timeline"
                ></p>
<p><strong>Step</strong> <strong>2: Choose Sample Color background</strong></p>
<p>After launching Filmora, go to the Sample Color category under the Media tab, and you will find many sample colors to choose from. Drag and drop one into the timeline.</p>
<p><img  
                     lazyload
                     src="/images/loading.svg"
                     data-src="https://images.wondershare.com/filmora/article-images/filmora-sample-color-library.jpg"
                      alt=" Filmora sample color library"
                ></p>
<p><strong>Step 3:</strong> <strong>Add and customize texts to the lyric video</strong></p>
<p>Filmora video editor offers a wide variety of pre-written content and lets the creators drag and drop to see how it looks, with no need for editing or other typical copywriting tasks. Go to the Titles tab, drag the desired text over to the sample color video track. Here, we prefer to use a default title</p>
<p><img  
                     lazyload
                     src="/images/loading.svg"
                     data-src="https://images.wondershare.com/filmora/article-images/customize-lyric-titles-filmora.jpg"
                      alt=" Filmora customize lyrics"
                ></p>
<p>Double click the titles in the timeline to customize the texts, fonts, colors, or animations. Click the Advanced button for a new window pops up where you can add a title box and do more customization. Such as giving the titles individual animation.</p>
<p><strong>Step 4: Add effects for texts</strong></p>
<p><img  
                     lazyload
                     src="/images/loading.svg"
                     data-src="https://images.wondershare.com/filmora/article-images/add-mild-effects-to-lyric-video.jpg"
                      alt=" add mile effects to  lyrics"
                ></p>
<p>To make the whole title dynamic, we can add some effects to the texts. Go to the Effects tab and then click on mild effects to put the mild effects to the text. Right-click the Mild effect and go to Properties to change its frequency and positions if needed.</p>
<p> <strong>Step</strong> <strong>5: Add</strong> <strong>transitions to texts</strong></p>
<p>Filmora video editor provides lots of transitions for playing the video smoother. Go to the Transitions tab and choose one and place it between each title to make the lyric video vivid.</p>
<p><img  
                     lazyload
                     src="/images/loading.svg"
                     data-src="https://images.wondershare.com/filmora/article-images/add-transitions-to-lyric-video.jpg"
                      alt=" add transition to  lyrics"
                ></p>
<p>A basic lyric video with animated titles, transitions, and effects is made. You can edit further to make the lyrics play through the images. Watch the video tutorial to get more information.</p>
