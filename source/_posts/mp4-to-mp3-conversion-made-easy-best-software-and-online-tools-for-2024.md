#### 5. [Pholody](https://www.pholody.com/editor)

Additionally, you also use Movie Maker Online to search for free music you can use in your videos without having to worry about the copyrights. The platform’s interface, however, is far from perfect and it may take you some time to get used to it and figure out how to add text to the photos you’re using in your video or how to choose for how long a photo is going to be displayed on the screen.

#### 9. [Slideshow Photos](https://slideshow.photos/)

**Price:** Free

![ Image to Video online maker ](https://images.wondershare.com/filmora/article-images/slide-show-online-image-to-video-online.jpg)

If you choose one of the subscription plans, you will be able to enhance each photo you include in your slideshow, before you export it to social media.

#### 11. [Adobe Spark](https://spark.adobe.com/make/slideshow-maker/)

**Price:** Free, Available through Adobe Creative Cloud Plan for $52.99 per month or as a stand-alone app for $9.99 per month

![ Image to Video online maker ](https://images.wondershare.com/filmora/article-images/image-to-video-online-adobe-spark.jpg)

**Price:** Free

![ Image to Video online maker ](https://images.wondershare.com/filmora/article-images/image-to-video-online-movie-maker-online.jpg)

If you don’t already have the photos you want to use in your video, the Movie Maker Online is an excellent choice for you, because the platform offers a rich selection of royalty free images. Additionally, you also use Movie Maker Online to search for free music you can use in your videos without having to worry about the copyrights. The platform’s interface, however, is far from perfect and it may take you some time to get used to it and figure out how to add text to the photos you’re using in your video or how to choose for how long a photo is going to be displayed on the screen.

#### 9. [Slideshow Photos](https://slideshow.photos/)

**Price:** Free

![ Image to Video online maker ](https://images.wondershare.com/filmora/article-images/slide-show-online-image-to-video-online.jpg)

You can create professional slideshows with this web-based app in a few easy steps, as you just have to select one out of four available templates and then upload at least 27 photos. Once you finish uploading the images, you can proceed to add text to your slideshow and then click on the Create a Slideshow button. The platform will then ask for your email address and it will send you an email that informs you that your video is going to be ready **in 11 hours unless you want to pay $4 to speed up the delivery time**.

#### 10. [PhotoShow](http://www.photoshow.com/home/start)

**Price:** Free version available, subscription plans start at $2.49 per month

![ Image to Video online maker ](https://images.wondershare.com/filmora/article-images/image-to-video-online.jpg)

 PhotoShow lets you create slideshows in three easy steps. After you upload the photos you want to use in a slideshow, you can preview the results and customize them in accordance with your demands and then you can share the slideshow. However, you will have to install the latest version of Adobe’s Flash Player in order to use this platform, so make sure that this software is updated before you start creating a new slideshow with it. If you choose one of the subscription plans, you will be able to enhance each photo you include in your slideshow, before you export it to social media.

#### 11. [Adobe Spark](https://spark.adobe.com/make/slideshow-maker/)

**Price:** Free, Available through Adobe Creative Cloud Plan for $52.99 per month or as a stand-alone app for $9.99 per month

![ Image to Video online maker ](https://images.wondershare.com/filmora/article-images/image-to-video-online-adobe-spark.jpg)

In order to start using Adobe Spark, you will first have to use your Google or Facebook account to sign in to your Adobe account. Furthermore, the free version of Adobe Spark offers only a limited amount of photo and video editing options. If you would like to gain access to premium features such as adding a logo or choosing the font of the text you would like to use in your slideshows, you will either have to purchase Adobe Spark as a stand-alone app or as a part of the Adobe’s Creative Cloud Plan. Creating a slideshow with Adobe Spark is remarkably easy since you just have to insert the text, pick a template and upload the photos you would like to add to the slideshow.

---

#### **Conclusion**

Turning your photos into awe-inspiring videos has never been so simple because you no longer need to have access to expensive professional video editing software products to create videos. Instead, you can produce videos from photos using the online image to video makers that enable you to generate videos in just a few easy steps.
