### VLC Player –Most Powerful Open Source 4K Media Player

VLC player has updated to include support for UHD codes for 4K video playback in version 2.2.1\. This 4K media player is well known for its features like open source, ism in video editing and support for a very wide range of codecs, making it possible to play back almost all video files on earth.

### Plex 4K Video Player – with New Look and 4K Support on PC

Plex presents its improved new face of desktop app for PCs. Aside from redesigned user interface, there's support for a "true" 4K interface and enhanced compatibility with H.265 codecs. In this manner, Plex has elbowed its way into the family of 4K media players. According to Plex, its Home Theater may continue to be available and open source, though the firm doesn't plan to continue developing it. However, the new UI without enabling mouse wheel for navigation makes Plex hard to navigate. And its back button does not take you back to where you were. Rather, it takes you to the older episode of a show.
