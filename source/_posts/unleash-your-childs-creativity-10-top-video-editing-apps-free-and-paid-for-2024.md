## Elevate Your Video Production: Cinematic Techniques in FCPX

# Full Guide on Making a Big-budget Cinematic Look Video with Final Cut Pro X

![author avatar](https://static-fr.wondershare.com/images-filmora/fr-caroline-laurent.png)

##### Caroline Laurent

 Mar 27, 2024• Proven solutions

Do you enjoy the view of movies? Do you find your videos dull and unexciting? How about giving a cinematic look to your videos?

I bet a lot of editors have been there. However, it won’t take you long to find out that movies are quite different from the video you recorded and edited.

No worries, this article explains why there are differences between self-made videos and movies, as well as simple yet detailed steps to make cinematic look videos with FCPX.

> * [Part 1: Difference between a Cinematic Look and a Normal Video?](#part1)
> * [Part 2: How to Make a Cinematic Look Film Video with FCPX?](#part2)
> * [Part 3: What Other Factors Contribute to Film-Look Videos?](#part3)
> * [Part 4: How to Add Cinematic Look to Your Footage in easy ways?](#part4)

## **Part 1: Difference between a Cinematic Look and a Normal Video?**

The term cinematic is often referred to the black bars or wide-screen frame ratios. Photographers and filmmakers use the term cinematic to describe the look of movies and pictures shot on film.

However, the term has changed its meaning with the advent of digital video and the invention of high-tech devices. With the evolution of the internet across the globe, YouTubers, videographers, and social media influencers have started using this term to describe anything related to cinema and film. In other words, a cinematic look is an unconventional, film-look, and professional appearance of a video that makes a normal clip look elegant and worth watching. [See the top 10 movies made by FCPX here.](https://tools.techidaily.com/wondershare/filmora/download/)

![Blade-Runner-2049-poster](https://images.wondershare.com/filmora/images/final-cut-pro/Blade-Runner-2049-poster.png)

So, here we draw a line between a normal video and the one with a cinematic look. In the latter, you adjust everything that is directly or indirectly linked to the quality of a video, including but not limited to **colors**, **appearance**, **light**, **motion**, **frame rate**, **composition**, and **camera** **movements**.

Resolution refers to the horizontal pixel count such as 2K (2.2 megapixels) or 4K (8.8 megapixels).

Do you enjoy the view of movies? Do you find your videos dull and unexciting? How about giving a cinematic look to your videos?

I bet a lot of editors have been there. However, it won’t take you long to find out that movies are quite different from the video you recorded and edited.

No worries, this article explains why there are differences between self-made videos and movies, as well as simple yet detailed steps to make cinematic look videos with FCPX.

## **Part 1: Difference between a Cinematic Look and a Normal Video?**

The term cinematic is often referred to the black bars or wide-screen frame ratios. Photographers and filmmakers use the term cinematic to describe the look of movies and pictures shot on film.

However, the term has changed its meaning with the advent of digital video and the invention of high-tech devices. With the evolution of the internet across the globe, YouTubers, videographers, and social media influencers have started using this term to describe anything related to cinema and film. In other words, a cinematic look is an unconventional, film-look, and professional appearance of a video that makes a normal clip look elegant and worth watching. [See the top 10 movies made by FCPX here.](https://tools.techidaily.com/wondershare/filmora/download/)

![Blade-Runner-2049-poster](https://images.wondershare.com/filmora/images/final-cut-pro/Blade-Runner-2049-poster.png)

So, here we draw a line between a normal video and the one with a cinematic look. In the latter, you adjust everything that is directly or indirectly linked to the quality of a video, including but not limited to **colors**, **appearance**, **light**, **motion**, **frame rate**, **composition**, and **camera** **movements**.

Resolution refers to the horizontal pixel count such as 2K (2.2 megapixels) or 4K (8.8 megapixels). Similarly, the frame rate defines the number of individual images or frames being displayed on the TV screen per second.
