Let's see which websites you can use to download the intro and title templates for Premiere Pro.

### 16. [Motion Array](https://motionarray.com/browse)

In addition to an impressive library of intro templates, Motion Array offers presets, sound effects, royalty-free music, and stock footage.

Furthermore, you can choose the software version to make sure that the templates you download can be used with the version of Adobe Premiere Pro you have installed on your computer.

The website provides you with powerful search tools, so you can select the resolution of the template, up to 8K, or choose which types of templates are going to be displayed.

Using the free subscription plan can limit your options since you'll only be able to download free templates, and your upload storage will be limited to just 1GB.

The Pro subscription plan that can be purchased for $54 per month will grant you access to an almost endless selection of title templates as well as a huge selection of plugins for Adobe Premiere Pro.

![free premiere pro templates](https://images.wondershare.com/filmora/article-images/Motion-Array.jpg)

### 17. [Cinecom – Simple Intro for Premiere Pro](https://www.cinecom.net/designer-packs/simple-titles-for-premiere-pro/)

### 20. [RocketStock](https://www.rocketstock.com/free-after-effects-templates/free-cinematic-title-library-for-premiere-pro/)

This option is best suited for video editors who want to create their intros because RocketStok's Cinematic Style Library extends the scope of options provided by Premiere Pro.

Once you've installed all the fonts from the library, you can use them to replace the software's default library. You just have to click on the Replace Style Library option that can be accessed from Premiere Pro's Title Style tab.

If you don't feel comfortable creating your titles or if you simply don't have the time to create your own titles, the Free Cinematic Style Library is not the best choice for you.

On the other hand, Premiere Pro's users who don't often use title templates can benefit from downloading RocketStock's intro library.

Let's see which websites you can use to download the intro and title templates for Premiere Pro.

### 16. [Motion Array](https://motionarray.com/browse)

In addition to an impressive library of intro templates, Motion Array offers presets, sound effects, royalty-free music, and stock footage.

The website provides you with powerful search tools, so you can select the resolution of the template, up to 8K, or choose which types of templates are going to be displayed.

Using the free subscription plan can limit your options since you'll only be able to download free templates, and your upload storage will be limited to just 1GB.

The Pro subscription plan that can be purchased for $54 per month will grant you access to an almost endless selection of title templates as well as a huge selection of plugins for Adobe Premiere Pro.

![free premiere pro templates](https://images.wondershare.com/filmora/article-images/Motion-Array.jpg)

### 17. [Cinecom – Simple Intro for Premiere Pro](https://www.cinecom.net/designer-packs/simple-titles-for-premiere-pro/)

Once you've installed all the fonts from the library, you can use them to replace the software's default library. You just have to click on the Replace Style Library option that can be accessed from Premiere Pro's Title Style tab.

If you don't feel comfortable creating your titles or if you simply don't have the time to create your own titles, the Free Cinematic Style Library is not the best choice for you.

On the other hand, Premiere Pro's users who don't often use title templates can benefit from downloading RocketStock's intro library.

Detailed tutorials provided by the official channel

[Try It Free](https://tools.techidaily.com/wondershare/filmora/download/) [Try It Free](https://tools.techidaily.com/wondershare/filmora/download/)

We’ve picked out some of the best **audio converters** available right now based on several different factors

You’ll be able to see for yourself just how good each audio converter actually is.

#### In this article

01 [How to Convert Audio?](#Part 1)

02 [How we tested the best audio converter software?](#Part 2)

03 [Essential Features of Audio Converter Software](#Part 3)

04 [What's the Best Free Audio Converter Software Programs](#Part 4)

## Part 1 **How to Convert Audio?**

Before we start listing the best **audio converters** down, we’ve prepared a bit of an overview for you! With this first part being a tutorial for how to use an **audio converter**! The example that we’ll be using is the 6th of the **audio converters** on our list, but it’s also the most general one. So, even if you decide to choose another, you should still be able to learn from this tutorial!

****Step 1: Launch The Audio Converter!**

The first step in any conversion, of course, is to have it all primed for conversion! The **free audio converter** that we’ll be using as our example is an online one, so there is no actual 'launching’ but one must open it up anyway through the link provided!

![Launch Audio Converter](https://images.wondershare.com/filmora/article-images/2022/01/the-6-best-audio-converter-software-to-pick%201.png)

****Step 2: Upload Audio File!**

The next general step is to 'Upload’ the audio file that you want to convert. Usually, this can be done either by making use of the drag-and-drop function or selecting the 'UPLOAD’ function that will allow you to browse your device for the audio file.

![Upload Audio for Conversion](https://images.wondershare.com/filmora/article-images/2022/01/the-6-best-audio-converter-software-to-pick%202.png)

****Step 3: Select Output Format!**

The next general step is to select the output format for the file that you want to convert! You can usually choose a whole array of formats for this: MP3, M4A, WAV, OGG, FLAC, WMA, M4R, AIFF, MMF, OPUS, MIDI, etc.

![Select Audio File Output Format](https://images.wondershare.com/filmora/article-images/2022/01/the-6-best-audio-converter-software-to-pick%203.png)

****Step 4: Start Conversion!**

Once the output format has been chosen, you can proceed with initializing the conversion! Usually, this is as simple as selecting 'CONVERT’.

![Start conversion](https://images.wondershare.com/filmora/article-images/2022/01/the-6-best-audio-converter-software-to-pick%204.png)

****Step 5: Download or Save File!**

Once the conversion has been completed, your **audio converter** will either give you an option to 'DOWNLOAD’ or 'SAVE’ the finished product to your device!

![Download or Save Converted Audio](https://images.wondershare.com/filmora/article-images/2022/01/the-6-best-audio-converter-software-to-pick%205.png)

## Part 2 **How we tested the best audio converter software?**

In order to make sure that we are providing the ultimate list of **audio converters** out there, we’ve tested every single one on this list (and then some!) We played around with the settings, tried out all compatible formats, determined their efficiency, intuitiveness, extra features, and so much more!

## Part 3 **Essential Features of Audio Converter Software**

There are three essential features that one needs to consider to decide which is the best **audio converter** software for them:

**●** **Input Formats and Output Formats**: These are the most basic of the basic when it comes to requirements, but it’s notable regardless! After all, if your audio converter ends up being so limited that it is incapable of converting some of the more obscure formats out there, you might find it useless in the future.

**●** **Conversion Speed**: No one has the time to spend endlessly on their computer to wait for a file to convert. Everything has a deadline! So, the speed of conversion is definitely something to consider.

**●** **Bonus Features**: What other features does this audio converter have in store for you? Will it allow you to create playlists? Trim your audio? Merge your audio? You might find some of these features to be not useful at this moment in time. But, you never know!

## Part 4 **What's the Best Free Audio Converter Software Programs**

Now to get to our list of the best **free audio converter** software available! We’ve made sure to include a variety below! Note, this list is not in any particular order as we arranged it in a way to highlight the best **audio converter** for each type of user…

### 01**[Wondershare Filmora Video Editor](https://tools.techidaily.com/wondershare/filmora/download/)**

**Supported Input:** MP3, M4A, WAV, AIFF, OGG, WMA, AIF

**Supported Output:** MP3, M4A, WAV, AIFF, OGG, WMA, AIF

The first of the **audio converters** on this list is Filmora Pro! Filmora Pro is not necessarily an audio converter, since it’s capable of doing so much more than that. But it earned a spot on this list anyway because it has audio converting features! We recommend this for users who want an 'All-in-One’ tool! One that will not only allow them to convert a variety of audio but also give them the ability to protect their projects with advanced video editing functions.

****Step 1: Launch The Audio Converter!**

The first step in any conversion, of course, is to have it all primed for conversion! The **free audio converter** that we’ll be using as our example is an online one, so there is no actual 'launching’ but one must open it up anyway through the link provided!

****Step 2: Upload Audio File!**

The next general step is to 'Upload’ the audio file that you want to convert. Usually, this can be done either by making use of the drag-and-drop function or selecting the 'UPLOAD’ function that will allow you to browse your device for the audio file.

## Part 2 **How we tested the best audio converter software?**

In order to make sure that we are providing the ultimate list of **audio converters** out there, we’ve tested every single one on this list (and then some!) We played around with the settings, tried out all compatible formats, determined their efficiency, intuitiveness, extra features, and so much more!

## Part 3 **Essential Features of Audio Converter Software**

There are three essential features that one needs to consider to decide which is the best **audio converter** software for them:

**●** **Input Formats and Output Formats**: These are the most basic of the basic when it comes to requirements, but it’s notable regardless! After all, if your audio converter ends up being so limited that it is incapable of converting some of the more obscure formats out there, you might find it useless in the future.

**●** **Conversion Speed**: No one has the time to spend endlessly on their computer to wait for a file to convert. Everything has a deadline! So, the speed of conversion is definitely something to consider.

**●** **Bonus Features**: What other features does this audio converter have in store for you? Will it allow you to create playlists? Trim your audio? Merge your audio? You might find some of these features to be not useful at this moment in time. But, you never know!

## Part 4 **What's the Best Free Audio Converter Software Programs**

We’ve picked out some of the best **audio converters** available right now based on several different factors

You’ll be able to see for yourself just how good each audio converter actually is.

#### In this article

01 [How to Convert Audio?](#Part 1)

02 [How we tested the best audio converter software?](#Part 2)

03 [Essential Features of Audio Converter Software](#Part 3)

04 [What's the Best Free Audio Converter Software Programs](#Part 4)

## Part 1 **How to Convert Audio?**

Before we start listing the best **audio converters** down, we’ve prepared a bit of an overview for you! With this first part being a tutorial for how to use an **audio converter**! The example that we’ll be using is the 6th of the **audio converters** on our list, but it’s also the most general one. So, even if you decide to choose another, you should still be able to learn from this tutorial!

****Step 1: Launch The Audio Converter!**

The first step in any conversion, of course, is to have it all primed for conversion! The **free audio converter** that we’ll be using as our example is an online one, so there is no actual 'launching’ but one must open it up anyway through the link provided!

![Launch Audio Converter](https://images.wondershare.com/filmora/article-images/2022/01/the-6-best-audio-converter-software-to-pick%201.png)

****Step 2: Upload Audio File!**

The next general step is to 'Upload’ the audio file that you want to convert. Usually, this can be done either by making use of the drag-and-drop function or selecting the 'UPLOAD’ function that will allow you to browse your device for the audio file.

![Upload Audio for Conversion](https://images.wondershare.com/filmora/article-images/2022/01/the-6-best-audio-converter-software-to-pick%202.png)

****Step 3: Select Output Format!**

The next general step is to select the output format for the file that you want to convert! You can usually choose a whole array of formats for this: MP3, M4A, WAV, OGG, FLAC, WMA, M4R, AIFF, MMF, OPUS, MIDI, etc.

![Select Audio File Output Format](https://images.wondershare.com/filmora/article-images/2022/01/the-6-best-audio-converter-software-to-pick%203.png)

****Step 4: Start Conversion!**

Once the output format has been chosen, you can proceed with initializing the conversion! Usually, this is as simple as selecting 'CONVERT’.

![Start conversion](https://images.wondershare.com/filmora/article-images/2022/01/the-6-best-audio-converter-software-to-pick%204.png)

****Step 5: Download or Save File!**

Once the conversion has been completed, your **audio converter** will either give you an option to 'DOWNLOAD’ or 'SAVE’ the finished product to your device!

![Download or Save Converted Audio](https://images.wondershare.com/filmora/article-images/2022/01/the-6-best-audio-converter-software-to-pick%205.png)

## Part 2 **How we tested the best audio converter software?**

In order to make sure that we are providing the ultimate list of **audio converters** out there, we’ve tested every single one on this list (and then some!) We played around with the settings, tried out all compatible formats, determined their efficiency, intuitiveness, extra features, and so much more!

## Part 3 **Essential Features of Audio Converter Software**

There are three essential features that one needs to consider to decide which is the best **audio converter** software for them:

**●** **Input Formats and Output Formats**: These are the most basic of the basic when it comes to requirements, but it’s notable regardless! After all, if your audio converter ends up being so limited that it is incapable of converting some of the more obscure formats out there, you might find it useless in the future.

**●** **Conversion Speed**: No one has the time to spend endlessly on their computer to wait for a file to convert. Everything has a deadline! So, the speed of conversion is definitely something to consider.

**●** **Bonus Features**: What other features does this audio converter have in store for you? Will it allow you to create playlists? Trim your audio? Merge your audio? You might find some of these features to be not useful at this moment in time. But, you never know!

## Part 4 **What's the Best Free Audio Converter Software Programs**

Now to get to our list of the best **free audio converter** software available! We’ve made sure to include a variety below! Note, this list is not in any particular order as we arranged it in a way to highlight the best **audio converter** for each type of user…

There are several versions of the software available, and each of them contains a different amount of options and video editing tools. Even with somewhat reduced capability, the least expensive version of the editor supports 360-degree as well as VR options for posting on social media such as Vimeo, Facebook or YouTube. CyberLink PowerDirector isn't a professional video editing software, but it still offers a lot of extraordinary options that can take you a step closer to producing a professional video.

**Features:** The 360-degree video editing options are probably the first thing that catches the eye when you look at the list of features the software provides, but its true power lies in its color tools. LUTs, HDR effects or Split Toning options are just the tip of the iceberg since PowerDirector offers countless tools for fine-tuning of the colors in your videos. Animated PIP effects and video collages make this video editing software a perfect choice for the production of tutorials and all other types of online videos.

**Advantages:** The audio editing options provided by CyberLink PowerDirector are nothing short of amazing since they enable the software's users to manipulate the audio files in any way they see fit.

**Limitations:** Motion tracking and color lookup features are not always reliable. The software is a bit overpriced when compared with similar video editing suits.

Magix has been the largest European video editing software manufacturer for more than two decades.

The video editing tools supplied by the Magix Video Pro are as impressive as its audio editing options. Lens correction features, Split screen videos or 360-degree video editing options reveal only a fraction of the software's capabilities.

KineMaster provides a wide range of video exporting options and allows you to share videos on popular social media networks.

**Pros:** Above average video and audio editing features.

**Limitations:** Offers a lot of options mobile video editors seldom use.

Creating neatly organized projects with LumaFusion is a simple task because the app features a powerful Project Manager that lets you sort files or select aspect ratios for your videos. In addition, the Media Library lets you import all types of files from a cloud storage or drag and drop media from other apps. Producing slow-motion videos that have 120 or 240fps or creating green screen videos using the Chroma Key effect is easy with LumaFusion. The app's audio editing features are as impressive as its video editing tools since they provide the complete control over the audio files to the video editor's users.

**Advantages:** Color correction options, LUTs or numerous visual effects are all part of the reason why LumaFusion is one of the best apps for mobile video editing.

**Limitations:** Only available for iOS devices.

This award-winning app for iOS devices provides all the tools a skilled video editor could desire. Its features include support for 4K videos, wide selection of aspect ratios as well as stylish intros, end credits, and titles. Besides offering professional video editing tools, Vizzywig also features Multi-Camera recording options that can capture videos in 8K resolution. In addition, the app is capable of producing videos that have eight times more pixels than the Apple's Facetime HD Camera. The non-linear timeline lets you arrange video clips in any way you see fit, and allows you to add multiple media files to each project you are working on.

**Advantages:** Lets you control the focus and exposure manually and produce videos with stunning picture quality.

**Limitations:** Single platform compatibility and a high price narrow down the number of the app's potential users.

Unlike the Adobe's app for mobile video editing, PowerDirector lives up to all expectations. This user-friendly app lets you create reverse, 4K, or green screen videos. To make things even better, you can easily apply visual and audio effects or add voiceovers to your projects. In addition to the video editor, the PowerDirector app is also equipped with a powerful photo editor that lets you manipulate images in a professional manner. You can use almost any type of video or audio file in this app because it provides support for all commonly used file formats.

**Advantages:** PowerDirector is designed to help its users polish their video quickly and effortlessly.

**Limitations:** Videos in 1080p and 4K resolutions can only be exported after you've made an in-app purchase.

Ooops…It looks like there isn't any tool that matches your demand. Please give it another try.

Magix has been the largest European video editing software manufacturer for more than two decades.

The video editing tools supplied by the Magix Video Pro are as impressive as its audio editing options. Lens correction features, Split screen videos or 360-degree video editing options reveal only a fraction of the software's capabilities. Magix Video Pro delivers professional video editing features to consumer-level users.

This award-winning app for iOS devices provides all the tools a skilled video editor could desire. Its features include support for 4K videos, wide selection of aspect ratios as well as stylish intros, end credits, and titles. Besides offering professional video editing tools, Vizzywig also features Multi-Camera recording options that can capture videos in 8K resolution. In addition, the app is capable of producing videos that have eight times more pixels than the Apple's Facetime HD Camera. The non-linear timeline lets you arrange video clips in any way you see fit, and allows you to add multiple media files to each project you are working on.

**Advantages:** Lets you control the focus and exposure manually and produce videos with stunning picture quality.

**Limitations:** Single platform compatibility and a high price narrow down the number of the app's potential users.

Unlike the Adobe's app for mobile video editing, PowerDirector lives up to all expectations. This user-friendly app lets you create reverse, 4K, or green screen videos. To make things even better, you can easily apply visual and audio effects or add voiceovers to your projects. In addition to the video editor, the PowerDirector app is also equipped with a powerful photo editor that lets you manipulate images in a professional manner. You can use almost any type of video or audio file in this app because it provides support for all commonly used file formats.

**Advantages:** PowerDirector is designed to help its users polish their video quickly and effortlessly.

**Limitations:** Videos in 1080p and 4K resolutions can only be exported after you've made an in-app purchase.
