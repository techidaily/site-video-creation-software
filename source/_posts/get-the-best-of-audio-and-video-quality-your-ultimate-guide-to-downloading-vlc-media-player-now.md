The easy, basic UI and huge array of customization options have enforced VLC Media Player's position at the top. And this article will show you how to get this best media player – VLC downloaded for a lovely video/music journey.

#### **Why Do We Choose to [Download VLC Media Player](https://www.videolan.org/vlc/index.html)?**

VLC is far-reaching and appealing, and it is the best media player widely recognized with a long R&D history and enormous consumer base:

1\. VLC can be applied to all operating systems including fuzzy BeOS system and mobiles (iOS, Android, Windows, WinRT). Therefore, no matter what your system is, Mac OS X, Windows, Linux or even BSD, Solaris, Window 8 RT, you can download VLC for them all. 

2\. The version 3.0.12 of VLC has added support for current M1 Macs and any future Macs with Apple Silicon chips. Better and faster performances are assured.

3\. In regard of creativity and functionality, VLC has created an open source code and generated free decoding and encoding library, which enables VLC to support a wide variety of video formats. It also allows you to play incomplete and damaged video files, handles file conversions as well as editing, and integrates online video with web channel streaming. By downloading VLC, all those demands can be well met.

#### **How to Download VLC – the Best Media Player?**

**\* VLC free download from online download websites;**   
 You can free download VLC Mac and Windows version from websites such as CNET, Softonic and Filehippo, so that you can at the same time view users' feedback, download records, comments and ratings to know more about the version you are about to download.

**\* VLC free download from official website;**  
 By entering in the VLC official website VideoLAN, you can choose to download VLC zip package for Windows XP, SP2 or later systems with or without installers, download VLC for windows x64, or download VLC latest source code. You can also free download VLC 64 bits for OS X, download 32&64 bits VLC universal package, or choose to download the corresponding source code etc. Choices can be more complete here.

However, VLC has its own shortages. Occasionally, VLC will encounter hitches while playing 4K, MKV, HD videos or audio files. It is **incapable of performing Windows AirPlay**, and its download and conversion procedures are **cockamamie and fussy**, which can be quite time consuming in fulfilling those tasks. In addition, the VLC is obviously and extremely **bug-ridden**. Since it's not rocket science, the more functions and features the player has, the more bugs and defects it will embrace. Therefore, we suggest a VLC download alternative for you to switch in between if VLC goes wrong.

VLC Download alternative - 5KPlayer is at present designed only for Mac and Windows. It rivals VLC in 4K/5K video playing, audio video download, file conversion, and exceeds in AirPlay. 5KPlayer supports videos and music of almost all formats including MKV, MP4, MOV, M4V, FLV, AVI, M4A, MP3, FLAC, etc. and is quite good at playing videos of high resolution like 4K/5K movies, 1080p videos.
