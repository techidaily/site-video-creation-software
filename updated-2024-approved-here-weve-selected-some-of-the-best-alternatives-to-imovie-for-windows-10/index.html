<p>It has been some time since Microsoft stopped all support for Windows 7, which left PC users without the<a class="link"   target="_blank" rel="noopener" href="https://tools.techidaily.com/wondershare/filmora/download/" >iMovie equivalent Windows Movie Maker <i class="fa-regular fa-arrow-up-right-from-square fa-sm"></i></a>. Moreover, Windows 10 doesn’t have a built-in app that is dedicated solely to video editing.</p>
<p>However, you shouldn’t panic if you are looking for <a class="link"   target="_blank" rel="noopener" href="https://tools.techidaily.com/wondershare/filmora/download/" >video editing software for Windows 10 <i class="fa-regular fa-arrow-up-right-from-square fa-sm"></i></a> since there are plenty of free and affordable options to choose from. In fact, finding an app you can use to polish your videos on PC computers, shouldn’t be too difficult even if you have no previous video editing experience.</p>
<p>That is why in this article we are going to take you through some of the best iMovie replacements for Windows 10 you can use to create stunning videos that are going to attract the attention of your online audience.</p>
<h2 id="Top-5-iMovie-Replacements-for-Windows-10-Free-Paid"><a href="#Top-5-iMovie-Replacements-for-Windows-10-Free-Paid" class="headerlink" title="Top 5 iMovie Replacements for Windows 10 [Free &amp; Paid]"></a>Top 5 iMovie Replacements for Windows 10 [Free &amp; Paid]</h2><p>iMovie isn’t designed to perform demanding video editing tasks, which is the reason why we selected the video editing software products that are aimed at newcomers to the video editing world. So let’s take a look at some of the best video editing apps for Windows 10 you can use as a replacement for iMovie.</p>
<h3 id="1-Windows-10-Photos-App"><a href="#1-Windows-10-Photos-App" class="headerlink" title="1. Windows 10 Photos App"></a>1. <a class="link"   target="_blank" rel="noopener" href="https://www.microsoft.com/en-us/p/microsoft-photos/9wzdncrfjbh4?activetab=pivot:overviewtab" >Windows 10 Photos App <i class="fa-regular fa-arrow-up-right-from-square fa-sm"></i></a></h3><p>The Photos app is the only built-in app on Windows 10 that offers video editing features. Even though the app is designed to help PC users view, organize and edit photos, you can still use it to perform basic video editing tasks.</p>
<p>You can either choose to start working on a new project from scratch or to create a video automatically. In case you decide to make a video automatically, you just have to select the footage, name your project and wait for the Photos App to generate a new video for you.</p>
<p>Opting to edit your footage manually will enable you to trim or split video clips, alter their playback speed and apply filters to the footage. Optionally, you can also add text layers to your videos, use motion effects to simulate camera movement, or use some available 3D filters. Exporting projects in resolutions higher than 1080p or uploading your videos directly to social media from the Photos app isn’t an option.</p>

Wondershare Filmora"></a>2. <a class="link"   target="_blank" rel="noopener" href="https://tools.techidaily.com/wondershare/filmora/download/" >Wondershare Filmora <i class="fa-regular fa-arrow-up-right-from-square fa-sm"></i></a></h3><p>If you are looking for a video editing app for Windows 10 that enables you to edit the videos recorded with action cameras, Smartphones, or DSLRs, then Filmora is probably one of your best options.</p>
<p>Wondershare’s video editor provides support for 4K videos, and it is compatible with almost all commonly used video file formats. Starting a new project or importing the footage into Filmora is a straightforward process that requires a minimum amount of effort. Creating the opening titles, enhancing the colors in video clips, applying filters and image overlays are just a few among the countless video editing options Filmora provides.</p>
<p>What’s more, the video editor is equipped with a music library that contains a selection of royalty-free songs, which enables you to create a soundtrack even if you don’t have the music you can use in your videos. You can export all your projects to your accounts on Vimeo or YouTube directly from Filmora, but you should keep in mind that all videos created with the free version of this video editor are going to be watermarked.</p>

<p>It has been some time since Microsoft stopped all support for Windows 7, which left PC users without the<a class="link"   target="_blank" rel="noopener" href="https://tools.techidaily.com/wondershare/filmora/download/" >iMovie equivalent Windows Movie Maker <i class="fa-regular fa-arrow-up-right-from-square fa-sm"></i></a>. Moreover, Windows 10 doesn’t have a built-in app that is dedicated solely to video editing.</p>
<p>However, you shouldn’t panic if you are looking for <a class="link"   target="_blank" rel="noopener" href="https://tools.techidaily.com/wondershare/filmora/download/" >video editing software for Windows 10 <i class="fa-regular fa-arrow-up-right-from-square fa-sm"></i></a> since there are plenty of free and affordable options to choose from. In fact, finding an app you can use to polish your videos on PC computers, shouldn’t be too difficult even if you have no previous video editing experience.</p>
<p>That is why in this article we are going to take you through some of the best iMovie replacements for Windows 10 you can use to create stunning videos that are going to attract the attention of your online audience.</p>
<h2 id="Top-5-iMovie-Replacements-for-Windows-10-Free-Paid-3"><a href="#Top-5-iMovie-Replacements-for-Windows-10-Free-Paid-3" class="headerlink" title="Top 5 iMovie Replacements for Windows 10 [Free &amp; Paid]"></a>Top 5 iMovie Replacements for Windows 10 [Free &amp; Paid]</h2><p>iMovie isn’t designed to perform demanding video editing tasks, which is the reason why we selected the video editing software products that are aimed at newcomers to the video editing world. So let’s take a look at some of the best video editing apps for Windows 10 you can use as a replacement for iMovie.</p>
<h3 id="1-Windows-10-Photos-App-3"><a href="#1-Windows-10-Photos-App-3" class="headerlink" title="1. Windows 10 Photos App"></a>1. <a class="link"   target="_blank" rel="noopener" href="https://www.microsoft.com/en-us/p/microsoft-photos/9wzdncrfjbh4?activetab=pivot:overviewtab" >Windows 10 Photos App <i class="fa-regular fa-arrow-up-right-from-square fa-sm"></i></a></h3><p>The Photos app is the only built-in app on Windows 10 that offers video editing features. Even though the app is designed to help PC users view, organize and edit photos, you can still use it to perform basic video editing tasks.</p>
<p>You can either choose to start working on a new project from scratch or to create a video automatically. In case you decide to make a video automatically, you just have to select the footage, name your project and wait for the Photos App to generate a new video for you.</p>
<p>Opting to edit your footage manually will enable you to trim or split video clips, alter their playback speed and apply filters to the footage. Optionally, you can also add text layers to your videos, use motion effects to simulate camera movement, or use some available 3D filters. Exporting projects in resolutions higher than 1080p or uploading your videos directly to social media from the Photos app isn’t an option.</p>

<p>As it is now the second decade of the 21st century, data carriers like DVDs are slowly becoming obsolete. A growing number of laptop and desktop PCs no longer feature optical disc drives, while the discontinuation of the Windows Media Center marked the end of an era in which Windows OS offered a built-in DVD player.</p>
<p>The Windows 10 doesn’t have a native app that enables you to play movies or music from DVD and Blu-ray discs, and you must install a third-party DVD<a class="link"   target="_blank" rel="noopener" href="https://tools.techidaily.com/wondershare/filmora/download/" >video player <i class="fa-regular fa-arrow-up-right-from-square fa-sm"></i></a> if you want to view content from these sources. Luckily there is no shortage of media players that are compatible with Windows 10, so in this article, we are going to take you through some of the <strong>best free DVD players</strong> on the market and help you choose the one that meets all your needs.</p>
<h2 id="Best-Free-DVD-Players-for-Windows-10"><a href="#Best-Free-DVD-Players-for-Windows-10" class="headerlink" title="Best Free DVD Players for Windows 10"></a>Best Free DVD Players for Windows 10</h2><p>Before you opt for one DVD player or the other you must first check which audio and <a class="link"   target="_blank" rel="noopener" href="https://tools.techidaily.com/wondershare/filmora/download/" >video file formats <i class="fa-regular fa-arrow-up-right-from-square fa-sm"></i></a> they support or find out if you can use them to play Blu-ray discs.

<p>Cartooning a photo is a simple and yet effective way of enhancing a picture and making it more visually appealing. Besides adding an artistic touch to portraits you take, cartooning a photo can also be a great way to have fun with your friends because the results of picture cartooning can be as entertaining as visually striking.</p>
<p>Besides portraiture, this visual effect can be applied to virtually any other genre of photography, although the contents of the shoot usually determine how well the effect is going to work. What’s more, you don’t need a <a class="link"   target="_blank" rel="noopener" href="https://tools.techidaily.com/wondershare/filmora/download/" >professional video editing software <i class="fa-regular fa-arrow-up-right-from-square fa-sm"></i></a> to cartoon a photo, since there are so many websites that let you apply this effect to your photos for free.</p>
<p>That’s why we selected some of the best websites for converting a photo into a cartoon.</p>

In fact, online cartoon photo makers are easy to use and they don’t require you to have a lot of photo editing experience.</p>
<p>We’ve selected some of the <a class="link"   target="_blank" rel="noopener" href="https://tools.techidaily.com/wondershare/filmora/download/" >best online photo editors <i class="fa-regular fa-arrow-up-right-from-square fa-sm"></i></a> and photo converters that enable you to cartoon your photos in just a few clicks.</p>
<h3 id="Part-1-Best-Free-Online-Cartoon-Photo-Editors-3"><a href="#Part-1-Best-Free-Online-Cartoon-Photo-Editors-3" class="headerlink" title="Part 1: Best Free Online Cartoon Photo Editors"></a>Part 1: Best Free Online Cartoon Photo Editors</h3><p>You don’t have to purchase an expensive photo editing software if you want to cartoon your photos because there are so many different online photo editing platforms that allow you to apply this effect to your photos for free. Let’s take a closer look at what they have to offer.</p>
<h4 id="2-BeFunky-3"><a href="#2-BeFunky-3" class="headerlink" title="2. BeFunky"></a>2. BeFunky</h4><p>Befunky is one of the best photo editors you can find online, which is why it is hardly surprising that it offers cartoonization effects. In fact, you can choose from <strong>five different cartoonization effects</strong> that are all equally impressive.</p>
<p>All of the cartoon effects Befunky has to offer are located in the Artsy menu, and you just have to click on Cartoonizer DLX, Cross Hatch DLX, Pop Art DLX, or Graphic Novel DLX effects in order to apply them to your photo. Furthermore, you can use the Erase mode if you don’t want to catoonize the entire photo or head over to the Adjust menu to specify the amount of the effect you’ll apply and increase or decrease the photo’s sharpness.</p>
<p>Go to <a class="link"   target="_blank" rel="noopener" href="https://www.befunky.com/features/photo-to-cartoon/" >https://www.befunky.com/features/photo-to-cartoon/ <i class="fa-regular fa-arrow-up-right-from-square fa-sm"></i></a> and you can then turn your photos to cartoon easily in BeFunky.</p>
<h4 id="3-Lunapic-3"><a href="#3-Lunapic-3" class="headerlink" title="3. Lunapic"></a>3. Lunapic</h4><p>This is yet another online photo editing platform that gives you access to a broad range of photo editing options for free. Even though a bit outdated, the Lunapic’s interface resembles Photoshop’s interface, so you won’t need much time to get used to it if you ever used Adobe’s iconic photo editing software.</p>
<p>Once you’ve uploaded a photo, you just have to go to the Effects menu and select the Cartoon option. Lunapic will then automatically apply the effect to the photo you uploaded and you just need to preview the image before you save it. The only downside is that you can’t adjust the effect’s settings in case you don’t like the results.</p>
<p>If you want to add cartoon effect to photo with this photo editor, you can go to <a class="link"   target="_blank" rel="noopener" href="https://www12.lunapic.com/editor/?action=cartoon" >https://www12.lunapic.com/editor/?action=cartoon <i class="fa-regular fa-arrow-up-right-from-square fa-sm"></i></a>.</p>

If you like the caricature you created, you can buy a print or you can choose to share your design for free. The Pro Cartoonizer feature this platform offers is only available if you purchase one of the available subscription plans.</p>

<h4 id="5-SnapsTouch-3"><a href="#5-SnapsTouch-3" class="headerlink" title="5. SnapsTouch"></a>5. SnapsTouch</h4><p>This is a simple online photo editor that lets you turn your photos into sketches, paintings, or drawings. Choosing the Painting option is probably the easiest way to turn a photo into a cartoon, although this effect can also be achieved with the Pencil Sketch feature.</p>
<p>After you upload a photo you want to turn into a cartoon, you can choose between Painting 1 and Painting 2 options in order to determine the style of the cartoon you’re creating.
