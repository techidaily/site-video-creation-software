## GOM Player Mac (Catalina) Free Download Guide & Reviews

 _Posted by [Kaylee Wood](https://www.quora.com/profile/Amanda-Hu-21) | Last update: April 28, 2020_

Forums keep discussing whether there is **GOM Player Mac** version as GOM Player official site only offers a Windows version, which makes us dizzied indeed. To stop meaningless exploration, I decide to ransack the search result about GOM Player Mac in the Internet one by one for you GOM Player fans who are looking for a GOM Player for Mac OS. Luckily, I have found one and you can get download guide here plus an alternative if this GOM Player Mac is not so pleasing.

Besides some fundamental features like smooth media playback, user-friendly subtitles preference, customizable skins, etc, GOM Player Mac gets popular mainly because of its embedded codec system for automatically downloading [GOM Player codec pack](https://tools.techidaily.com/5kplayer/video-music-player/) so that you won't have to search for codecs everytime you cannot play a video format. So, you are encouraged to download GOM Player for Mac even if it has some flaws.

### GOM Player for Mac Download & Install Guide

Though most of the results are [GOM Player for Windows](https://tools.techidaily.com/5kplayer/video-music-player/) when you search GOM Player Mac, actually some of these setups are also available for Mac. Considering the safety, we suggest you download GOM Player for Mac on the reliable download site Softonic where GOM Player Mac gets over 1800 downloads a month. 

**Download GOM Player for Mac:** Just open Softonic site -> tap GOM Player Mac into the search box and hit enter -> here you will see a Windows download button -> move your mouse down and click Mac -> click Free Download button on the top right coner to access the real GOM Player Mac download page -> then click Free Download.

**Install GOM Player on Mac:** When the download finishes, a dialogue box will pop out for you to drag GOM Player Mac setup into the Application Folder.

Worth mentioning, GOM Player for Mac exists for a long time but only in beta 1.0 version. So, it won't contain some new features and be very satisfying at least it won't support [GOM Player 360 playback](https://tools.techidaily.com/5kplayer/video-music-player/) ability as on Windows. Meanwhile, you may encounter some problems as other GOM Player Mac users:

**GOM Player Mac Problems:**

_\- "Ugh.. I've downloaded and installed it yet everytime I hit stream it says "GOM player is not installed, install now?" so I click yes and re-install and the same thing happens again."_ 
 _\- "I am trying to run movie on GOM player for Mac, when I open the movie, GOM player name appears on top of menu bar, but no player appears."_

It is not surprised that GOM Player Mac brings some troubles as it has stopped updating. It depends on your preference to uninstall it and install a GOM Player Mac alternative, say VLC, 5KPlayer, KMPlayer, etc, even though I highly suggest you to do that.

## Try GOM Player Mac Alternative 5KPlayer – macOS Catalina Supported

Again, I recommend you 5KPlayer as GOM Player Mac alternative. 5KPlayer is a professional Mac app integrated with [video music playback](https://tools.techidaily.com/5kplayer/video-music-player/), online [video music download](https://tools.techidaily.com/5kplayer/youtube-download/) and [media streaming](https://tools.techidaily.com/5kplayer/airplay/). Supporting up to 450+ video codecs and 180+ audio codecs makes it a piece of cake for 5KPlayer to play MKV, AVI, WMV, MP4, FLV, ASF, F4V, SWF, MP3, AAC, OGG, FLAC, etc files in 1080p 4K 8K etc. Built-in DLNA tech, you can also stream these media files from iPhone/iPad/Android to Mac/PC and Mac/PC to smart TV wirelessly. Even if you particularly love GOM Player Mac, you can still use 5KPlayer to download various videos music for your GOM to play.
