There are a number of options that enable you to reduce the size of a video on the latest version of the Windows OS, but which one you are going to choose depends on a number of factors that range from your preferred method of reducing a video file’s size to how fast the compression process is.

In this article, we are going to take you through **nine best free video compressors for Windows 10** and help you discover the one you feel comfortable using.

There are three different ways to compress a video in VLC.

You can either convert a file **by changing its output file format, adjusting the bitrate and the frame rate** or by cropping and recording segments of the video clip you want to compress.

The fastest and easiest way to reduce a video’s size in VCL is to change its file format. You can do this by clicking on the **Convert/Save option** in the **Media menu**. You can then select one of the available profile presets from the **Profile drop-down menu** and select the option that is best suited for the context in which the video is going to be used. Optionally, you can click on the **Settings icon** next to the Profile drop-down menu in case you would like to adjust a video’s resolution manually.

### 4.[Freemake Video Converter](https://www.freemake.com/free%5Fvideo%5Fconverter/)

![Freemake video

converter compress video interface ](<https://images.wondershare.com/filmora/article-images/freemake-video-converter-compress-video.jpg>)

You can also use this Windows-based file [converter to compress **Full HD** and **4K** video](https://tools.techidaily.com/wondershare/filmora/download/) files without any quality loss.

### 5.[HandBrake Video Transcoder](https://handbrake.fr/)
