 _Posted by [Kaylee Wood](https://www.quora.com/profile/Amanda-Hu-21) | Last update: April 28, 2020_

**Multi region DVD player**, as its name indicates, can play DVDs of all regions without external help to decode the DVD region code. To choose the best multi region DVD player, you should not only look the brand and price, but also the multifunction, stability, durability and the convenience it brings to you. Here I list three models of all region DVD players for you to choose and they are produced by the well known DVD player manufacturers – Sony, Samsung and Phillips.

**All Region DVD Player 1080P HDMI Upscaling - Phillips DVP 2880**

Phillips DVP 2880/F7 multi region 1080p HDMI upscaling DVD player owns the ability to play all regions DVDs, PAL/NTSC DVDs on American TV and upconverts them up to 1080p resolution with HDMI cable. It is compact and trouble free only the red signal light is a bit confusing.
