The values mentioned in the aspect ratio are not the actual value but refer to the relation of the width and height.

Several aspect ratio standards are used in the present times like 16:9, 4:3, 3:2, 1.85:1, and more.</p>
<p>An aspect ratio defines the resolution of the display and thus for proper video playback that fits in within the screen size, the right aspect ratio has to be selected. Aspect ratio plays an important role in video resizing. To ensure that the videos do not look distorted while resizing, its aspect ratio has to be maintained.</p>

After the Setting window opens, click on the ‘Enable Google Play Store on your Chromebook’ check box located at the bottom of the Settings window under Google Play Store (beta) option.
