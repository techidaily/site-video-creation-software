Adding video, audio, and still, photo assets to the files pane will put them on the timeline and allow you to assemble your story.

Videos and still images are organized into bins by the app, ensuring they don't get confused on the timeline, which speeds up the workflow, especially for newcomers.

The app uses menus and can be dragged and dropped, so a single objective can be accomplished in different ways. You can control all functions from within the application frame, or dockable panels can be used to get a closer look at what needs to be done. A permanent reorganization of the workspace would be appreciated.

### **Videopad Video Editing Features**

VideoPad is the perfect balance between too much and not enough. Although there are not many options, it offers a reasonable selection of transitions for moving between clips and images, as well as a selection of filters to give them a unique look. In addition to editing 360-degree video, video stabilization is another helpful feature.

Each filter can be previewed with a click before applying it, and You can combine several to create a custom effect or template for reuse. You can also adjust their length via menus.

A video can be enhanced with transitions, visual effects, overlays, and text using VideoPad. Also included are some basic audio tools and a library of sound effects and atmospheric background music.

With its video stabilization feature, you can reduce camera shake, and the high-end version supports special effect plugins, but only for Windows.

### **Videopad Audio Editing Features**

VideoPad offers a limited set of audio tools, but it does allow you to mix multiple audio tracks, music, and narration to create a movie soundtrack. A video clip's audio can be faded, mixed, and adjusted for volume, but if you want to go further, you'll need an external mixer or editor. From VideoPad's main menu, you can download NCH's own WavePad.

While the text-to-speech features always sounded false, you can record narration directly within the program. There is a great idea in having voice recognition for subtitles, which is only available on the Windows version. However, the implementation falls short of expectations. Although the video was clearly spoken in a quiet environment, it automatically failed to translate into subtitles.

### **Videopad Content Sharing features**

Video creators who publish to YouTube or other social media platforms can use the software because it allows them to share videos directly to platforms such as Dropbox, Flickr, Google Drive, and Vimeo. To avoid unnecessary data sharing, you can save videos to your desktop and upload them yourself.

In addition to editing 360-degree video, video stabilization is another helpful feature.

Each filter can be previewed with a click before applying it, and You can combine several to create a custom effect or template for reuse. You can also adjust their length via menus.

A video can be enhanced with transitions, visual effects, overlays, and text using VideoPad. Also included are some basic audio tools and a library of sound effects and atmospheric background music.

### **Videopad Audio Editing Features**

VideoPad offers a limited set of audio tools, but it does allow you to mix multiple audio tracks, music, and narration to create a movie soundtrack. A video clip's audio can be faded, mixed, and adjusted for volume, but if you want to go further, you'll need an external mixer or editor. From VideoPad's main menu, you can download NCH's own WavePad.

The popularity of video content on social media networks has been soaring in the last couple of years, and it is only reasonable to expect this trend to continue. Tutorials, promotional videos and various other types of videos for social media help companies run successful advertising campaigns and increase their profits. You don’t have to be a seasoned video editing professional in order to create videos for social networks, in fact, you can make viral videos even with entry-level video editing software, like iMovie or Avidemux. That’s the reason why in this article we are going to introduce you to 10+ best video editing apps you can use online, on Mac and PC computers or Smartphones.

## Best Video Editing Software for Novice Video Content Creators in 2024

Anyone who has access to a computer that runs on a macOS or Windows OS can edit videos for free because both of these operating systems have built-in video editing software. Let’s take a look at the free video editing options Mac and PC users have at their disposal in 2024.

#### 1. [iMovie](https://www.apple.com/imovie/) –Best Free Video Editing Software for Beginners on macOS and iOS

The app also lets you create PIP and split screen videos, alter the playback speed of a video clip or create engaging opening titles or end credits. The royalty-free music, sound effects or the voiceover recording feature can all help you create a perfect soundtrack for each video you edit in iMovie.

#### 2. [Photos App](https://www.microsoft.com/en-us/p/microsoft-photos/9wzdncrfjbh4?activetab=pivot:overviewtab) –Best Free Video Editing Software for Beginners on Windows 10

Even though the Photos App doesn’t offer a lot of video editing options you can still use it to process the footage you recorded before sharing it online. The app’s Edit&Create menu offers Draw, Add slo-mo or Trim tools that allow you to draw over the source footage and remove unwanted pieces of video clips from the timeline. The Photos App is equipped with a number of 3D effects and a rich collection of filters that can assist you in creating a distinctive visual style for each new video you edit with it. However, the app’s exporting options are far from impressive, since you can’t export your projects to social media directly from the Photos App.

Certain options like video stabilization are only available on the version of the video editing software that is compatible with Windows 8, and the exact list of the tools provided by Windows Movie Maker varies on different versions of the Windows OS.

 Mar 27, 2024• Proven solutions

The popularity of video content on social media networks has been soaring in the last couple of years, and it is only reasonable to expect this trend to continue. Tutorials, promotional videos and various other types of videos for social media help companies run successful advertising campaigns and increase their profits. You don’t have to be a seasoned video editing professional in order to create videos for social networks, in fact, you can make viral videos even with entry-level video editing software, like iMovie or Avidemux. That’s the reason why in this article we are going to introduce you to 10+ best video editing apps you can use online, on Mac and PC computers or Smartphones.

## Best Video Editing Software for Novice Video Content Creators in 2024

Anyone who has access to a computer that runs on a macOS or Windows OS can edit videos for free because both of these operating systems have built-in video editing software. Let’s take a look at the free video editing options Mac and PC users have at their disposal in 2024.

#### 1. [iMovie](https://www.apple.com/imovie/) –Best Free Video Editing Software for Beginners on macOS and iOS

Learning how to use iMovie to create videos for social media won’t take too much of your time, as the app’s intuitive interface makes performing all basic video editing actions look easy. iMovie lets you edit footage recorded in resolutions up to 4K and it features 10 high fidelity filters that enhance the colors in your videos. The app also lets you create PIP and split screen videos, alter the playback speed of a video clip or create engaging opening titles or end credits. The royalty-free music, sound effects or the voiceover recording feature can all help you create a perfect soundtrack for each video you edit in iMovie.

#### 2. [Photos App](https://www.microsoft.com/en-us/p/microsoft-photos/9wzdncrfjbh4?activetab=pivot:overviewtab) –Best Free Video Editing Software for Beginners on Windows 10

Even though the Photos App doesn’t offer a lot of video editing options you can still use it to process the footage you recorded before sharing it online. The app’s Edit&Create menu offers Draw, Add slo-mo or Trim tools that allow you to draw over the source footage and remove unwanted pieces of video clips from the timeline. The Photos App is equipped with a number of 3D effects and a rich collection of filters that can assist you in creating a distinctive visual style for each new video you edit with it. However, the app’s exporting options are far from impressive, since you can’t export your projects to social media directly from the Photos App.

#### 3. [Windows Movie Maker](https://tools.techidaily.com/wondershare/filmora/download/) –Best Free Video Editing Software for Beginners on Windows 8/7

It’s already been a couple of years since the Windows Movie Maker was discontinued, but despite that this video editing software remains one of the best options for novice video editors who are still using Windows 8 or older versions of the Windows OS. Windows Movie Maker grants you access to a huge collection of transitions and visual effects and it makes the process of creating titles effortless. Certain options like video stabilization are only available on the version of the video editing software that is compatible with Windows 8, and the exact list of the tools provided by Windows Movie Maker varies on different versions of the Windows OS.

#### 4. [Avidemux](http://avidemux.sourceforge.net/) –Best Free Open Source Video Editing Software for Beginners in 2020

Transcoding video files or automating video editing tasks is the most common reason why inexperienced video editors opt for Avidemux. This open source video editor is compatible with Linux, macOS and Windows OS, which means that you can edit videos with it regardless of the computer you have. Avidemux supports nearly all video file formats, and it is a perfect choice for all video content creators who frequently shoot their videos on different cameras. Nonetheless, the number of video editing tools Avidemux offers is far from impressive which limits your options during the video editing process.

## Best Cheap Video Editing Software for Beginners in 2020

Creating professional-looking videos with free video editing software products is a challenging task even for an experienced video editor. So, instead of struggling to make visually impactful content with free video editing apps you can purchase the license to use video editors that offer an abundance of video editing tools. Here are some of the least expensive options on the market.
