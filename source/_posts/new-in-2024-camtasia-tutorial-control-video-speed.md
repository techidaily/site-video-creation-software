### Features of the Filmora video editor

Filmora unleashed some new features for advanced editing capabilities.

* **Instant mode**: Filmora 11 has encompassed an instant mode feature that’s also time-saving. With this, you can quickly edit your videos with just a few clicks.
* Speed ramping: This feature lets you quickly edit speed ramping effects on your video. Instantly increase, reduce, or go slow-motion, among other options.
* **Masking:** This has been improved to let you animate the mask and customize it as per your desire.
* **Automontage maker:** With this feature, you can now automatically create video montages with just a few clicks.
* **Creative Center:** You now don’t need to go round to get your tools. The Creative Center is the tool page where you can instantly get your favorite too.
* **Stock Media:** The improved Filmora 11 comes with an inbuilt stock media feature where you can download and use up to 100% free copyright stock footage. These include Pixabay and Giphy, among others.

## Conclusion

● The Splice video editor works earnestly on your mobile phone to edit and create compelling videos. The fact that it doesn’t support a desktop version is a major drawback.

● However, the Filmora video editor comes in handy for editing videos on both Windows and Mac OS computers. Nonetheless, the latest Filmora 11 version has added advanced features that improve its instant video editing ability.
