## How to edit audio on FCP

There are 2 ways of editing audio of videos on FCP-clip-level audio editing and advanced audio editing.

#### Section 1 Clip-level audio editing

While dragging the audio or video clip onto the timeline you have surely seen the level line right above the clip waveform. One can just drag the level line and move it up or down for adjusting the dB of any given clip.

![ Clip-level audio editing ](https://images.wondershare.com/filmora/article-images/edit-audio-in-fcp-1.png)

The job of the tiny white points on the right and left side of the clip is to apply the fade in and fade out effect on the audio. The left sided point can be dragged to the right to mark the ending of the fade-in effect of the clip. The right point has to be dragged left to set the start of the fade-out point.

**Related Article:** [How to fade in/out audio in Final Cut Pro >>](https://tools.techidaily.com/wondershare/filmora/download/)

**Note:** In this level, any effects and adjustments in audio are applicable for the entire clip including the audio channels within it. All the adjustments in the individual audio channels made by you would be preserved by FCP. This implies that when one reduces the volume for just one channel but increases the volume of the entire clip, then the single channel’s volume is only raised in proportion to the volume of the other channels. Ideally, you should do your edits at the clip-level when you have only one or two audio channels on your video clip.

#### Section 2: Advanced Audio Editing

The audio of the video can be detached for editing the audio file separately. The Audio Inspector of FCP provides you with all precise controls of audio edit like pan, effect, volume, equalization and audio configuration.

![ The Audio Inspector ](https://images.wondershare.com/filmora/article-images/edit-audio-in-fcp-3.png)

In order to detach the audio, you need to go to **Clip** \> **Detach Audio**. Or you can just right-click on the video file and click on Detach audio.

![ Detach audio ](https://images.wondershare.com/filmora/article-images/edit-audio-in-fcp-4.png)

**Note:** There is a fine difference between ‘Detach Audio’ and ‘Expand Audio’. In Expand Audio, the audio clip is synced with the video. For instance, while moving the audio to the timeline, the video clip would also go with it. In case of detaching audio however the audio file would remain as a standalone clip that can be inserted into any portion of the video.

The Audio Inspector would allow you to apply the following effects:

* The volume can be increased by dragging the handle on the right side and lowered by dragging it towards the left.
* Audio Equalization would allow the user to apply various effects (bass, loudness, boost, etc.) on the audio clip. It can also be adjusted by using the in-built audio equalizer.

![ Audio Equalization ](https://images.wondershare.com/filmora/article-images/edit-audio-in-fcp-5.png)

* Pan- Users can select from a number of Pan modes like surround sound or stereo. When you select ‘surround’, Final Cut Pro would provide you with a **Surround Panner** which would allow you to fine-tune the effects by moving the white point.

![Pan](https://images.wondershare.com/filmora/article-images/edit-audio-in-fcp-6.png)

* Effects- for this option one needs to go to the effects browser of the **Audio Inspector** or just hit comd5\. This would allow you to choose many different audio effects such as echo, distortion, spaces and much more. Just double-click on any effect to find a range of editing options.

![Effects](https://images.wondershare.com/filmora/article-images/edit-audio-in-fcp-7.png)

* Audio Configuration: The audio configuration tool would allow the user to modify the audio channel with mono, stereo, or reverse stereo.

## The Ultimate List of Free Face Generator Websites

While signing up for a social media account, you may not want to use your real photograph as your profile picture, but at the same time, you might not find it ethical to use someone else’s image either. This is where a **face generation portal** comes into play. You can easily **create a virtual face** that looks almost like you and sometimes even better with a face generator.

Similarly, run a business where you want to publish your clients’ reviews without showing their real photos as they might not like the idea. You can use a good face generator online tool to create a virtual face that resembles their look and post it along with their feedback.

Considering the above scenarios and many others that may come up over time, the following list some of the best free online face generators to create fake faces.

## Best Free Online Face Generators to Get Virtual Faces in 2022

### 1\. Generated Photos: Faces

**Website**: <https://generated.photos/faces>

This online portal enables you to create virtual faces by specifying the physical attributes of a character, such as gender, age, hair color, eye color, and much more. You can be as creative as you want to generate a face that appears somewhat like you with the available options. Once a look is generated, you can download and use it as needed.

The steps that are given below explain how you can use Generated Photos’ Faces section to create and download a virtual face:

* Click your preferred character from the AI-generated faces, and then click **Download** from the page that opens next. Choose your preferred method to sign up, and then sign in to download the virtual face to your PC.

### 2\. Generated Photos: Anonymizer

**Website**: <https://generated.photos/anonymizer>

Anonymizer is another section from the Generated Photos portal that allows you to upload your image. Then it uses AI technology to generate similar virtual faces that you can download and use wherever needed.

However, sometimes the pictures that the website creates may not resemble your face as closely as you expect them to be, but that’s OK. Isn’t it? The main idea is to keep your privacy intact, and that’s what Generated Photos: Anonymizer does.

You can learn how to use this section by following the instructions given below:

* Use the URL given above to get to the Anonymizer’s web page and then click **Upload photo;**
* Select and upload your photo from your PC to the portal and wait while Anonymizer uses AI to generate similar faces.
* Click the photo that you want to use, and when the next page opens up, click Sign up or sign in to download the photo and use it wherever needed

![recreate face with anonymizer online face generators](https://images.wondershare.com/filmora/article-images/recreate-face-with-anonymizer-online-face-generators.jpg)

### 3\. Generated Photos Face Generator

Website: [](https://generated.photos/face-generator)<https://generated.photos/face-generator>

This online face generator from Generated Photos allows you to create a unique realt-time face from scratch in one click. And if you don’t like the face generated, you can change the parameters such as gender, skin tone, hair, eye and head pose.

Generated Photos Face Generator tool is a good choice for people who don’t want to upload any photos online, and need to customize the face at maximum.

Below is a brief tutorial about how to generate a face with it step by step:

* Go to the website give above and then click the **Generate faces**
* Select the parameters accordingly based on your needs. You can generate the same face young or old with different emotions.

![generated photos face generator online](https://images.wondershare.com/filmora/article-images/generated-photos-face-generator-online.jpg)

You can then download the generated photo by signing up or logging in, but you need to pay to remove the watermark.

### 4\. Massless

**Website:** [https://massless.io/tool/face-maker-ai](https://massless.io/tool/face-maker-ai/)

Massless allows you to use its tools to sketch a portrait, and then it uses AI technology to generate a virtual face out of your drawing. However, because you can’t always be precise while sketching with the mouse, it would be good to have access to a digital drawing pad to create the faces with a pen. With Massless, you can explore your creativity to the full and draw beautiful faces to use them as your avatar.

You can follow the procedure given below to use Massless to draw virtual faces:

* Open a web browser, and visit the URL given above. Click any icons from the toolbox at the top (E.g., **Nose**).
* Draw a shape on its corresponding face area on the left (E.g., **Nose**), and wait while the portal automatically updates the photo on the right.
* Repeat the process to sketch other parts of the face, and click the More icon (with three vertical dots) from the top-right corner.
* Click **Download images** from the page that opens next to download the photo to your PC and use it wherever needed.

### 5\. This Person Does Not Exist

**Website:** <https://thispersondoesnotexist.com/>

This free online virtual face generator is probably the easiest and quickest. As you go to the website, it displays a random realistic image of a person that may not exist. If you don’t like the idea, you can change it with merely a single mouse click. Because the portal doesn’t have any Download button at the time of this writing, you must rely on the web browser’s default downloading process to get the image to your PC.

You can follow the instructions that are given below to switch between the images and download the one you like:

* Use your preferred web browser (Google Chrome here) to visit the URL provided above, and then notice the random image that appears on the page;
* Click **Another** from the box that appears at the bottom-right corner to change the image, repeat this process until you find a good photo for your avatar, and then right-click anywhere on the image.
* Click **Save image** from the context menu to save the photo. And then go to the default download folder to access the downloaded image, and use the picture wherever needed.

**Note:** Different browsers may have this feature with other names

### 6\. BoredHumans

**Website**: <https://boredhumans.com/faces.php>

This web portal is identical to the previous one as it generates random virtual faces with merely one mouse click. Even this website doesn’t have any Download button to help you download the image.

To add an extra layer of security, you can avoid using your real photograph as a profile picture, and go with the fake faces instead. You can generate these virtual faces using any of the free online face generator websites, some of which even allow you to define the shape of a face quite minutely. Because the generated faces are not of any real human, they can be used as your avatar without any risk.

![changing frame rate on stop motion studio](https://images.wondershare.com/filmora/article-images/2021/changing-frame-rate-on-stop-motion-studio.jpg)

Tip: To ensure that your object is in the right place, you can use different controls like grid and onion skin. The grid will give you an idea of where you placed the subject in the frame. The onion skin puts the last frame you captured on top of your camera's live view. In this way, you can see how far you moved your subject between frames.

Step 3: You can click as many pictures as you need to convey your story. After clicking all the pictures, you can edit them as per your requirements. To increase or decrease the speed at which your video plays, change the frame rate by choosing the number of pictures to be shown per second when you play the video. Play the video to see how your work turned out. If you like the end result, exit the editor.

Step 4: Now select the animation that you just saved. Click on the export icon which you will find at the top left of the screen—select animated GIF from the pulldown menu. Export the file to Google drive, mail yourself or upload it on your social media profile. AirDrop the file to other iPhone users if you are an iPhone user.

![adding new movie in stop motion studio](https://images.wondershare.com/filmora/article-images/2021/adding-new-movie-in-stop-motion-studio.jpg)

Step 2: Set the object you wish to capture in the frame. Let us consider one example where we will turn over an object. Click the camera icon to capture the shot. Move the thing a little and again tap on the shutter icon. Repeat the process until you have moved it all the way around. Once done, click on the play button.

![changing frame rate on stop motion studio](https://images.wondershare.com/filmora/article-images/2021/changing-frame-rate-on-stop-motion-studio.jpg)

Tip: To ensure that your object is in the right place, you can use different controls like grid and onion skin. The grid will give you an idea of where you placed the subject in the frame. The onion skin puts the last frame you captured on top of your camera's live view. In this way, you can see how far you moved your subject between frames.

Step 3: You can click as many pictures as you need to convey your story. After clicking all the pictures, you can edit them as per your requirements. To increase or decrease the speed at which your video plays, change the frame rate by choosing the number of pictures to be shown per second when you play the video. Play the video to see how your work turned out. If you like the end result, exit the editor.

Step 4: Now select the animation that you just saved. Click on the export icon which you will find at the top left of the screen—select animated GIF from the pulldown menu. Export the file to Google drive, mail yourself or upload it on your social media profile. AirDrop the file to other iPhone users if you are an iPhone user.
