It's official! Apple will now start making in-house processors for Macs based on ARM 64-bit architecture, proving to be faster and much more efficient than its previous models. With all that, there might be a problem. Any software that does not support the new Apple M1 chip may not be compatible with Apple devices. But Wondershare has taken care of that small inconvenience.

![apple m1 chip in arm](https://images.wondershare.com/filmora/Mac-articles/apple-m1-chip-in-arm.jpg)

The good news is that all versions of Wondershare Filmora X that are above 10.1 will support ARM. We at Wondershare have conducted these internal tests on all Apple Mac devices such as the Macbook Air, Macbook Mini, and Macbook Pro.

The testers at Wondershare have found out that our state-of-the-art software is all set to be utilized on the new and improved M1 chip that will be used in the new Macbooks.

We have released our newest version of Filmora which is the 10.1 and that is just the beginning! We plan to upgrade our software and come out with innovations that will surely match every update that Apple comes up with using the latest ARM 64-bit architecture.

As Apple introduces technological innovations, Filmora will match that with its product and service upgrades to ensure a better video editing experience for its users.

Like the Ubersense Coach, Coach's Eye exists for sports-driven individuals who want to have a technical, slow-motion video of their training and practices. Capture your sports videos, use its zoom function and instantly review its slow-motion playback with drawing tools. You could draw on the videos, encircle things, use freehand tools and even add audio commentaries. However, the tools are not included in the Free version of this app.

Place videos side-to-side for further analysis and refine your sports techniques.

Lucky Clan's slow motion app has garnered the hearts of its iOs users. When the Slow Motion button is tapped, you can record a high frame rate slow motion video with a smooth transition from the normal sequence. Focus and exposure points can be easily adjusted, and you could record your next slow motion video while the previous one is being rendered.

Remember that the frame rate is dependent on the iOs devices. That's 120 fps for the iPhone 5s+, 60 fps for the iPhone5/5c and iPad mini, and 30 fps on the other Apple devices.

Game Your Video is an iOs app developed by Global Delight. This easy-to-use app can integrate live motion effects, which you could apply while playing. You could also choose video filters or use the reverse feature for a dramatic impact. Put in some games into your videos by slow mo-ing them.

To make your slow-mo video even cooler, you can add audio effects like altered voices or a custom soundtrack from your library.
