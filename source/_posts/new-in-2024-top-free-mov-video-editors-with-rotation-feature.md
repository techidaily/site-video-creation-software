 With the rise of smartphone-captured videos, you are more likely to come across videos that were filmed sideways. This can make viewing difficult. Luckily, rotating your video is a snap if you choose one of the top 5 free MOV video rotators below.

#### [Movie Rotator 2.0](http://movierotator.com/)

 The updated version of Movie Rotator allows users to convert films and movies into portrait mode from landscape, or vice versa. It's perfect for moving MOV file formats onto your hand held devices so you can watch films there in comfort. Movie Rotator 2.0 is specifically for those that have upgraded their operating systems to Windows 7 or 8\. If you are still using XP or Vista you should stick to the old version.

![free mov video rotator](https://images.wondershare.com/images/multimedia/video-editor/movie-rotator.jpg "free mov video rotator")

**Pros:**

* Easy-to-use.

**Cons:**

* Supported video formats are limited;
* Only available for Windows 7 and 8.

#### [Video Rotator 1.0.7](http://www.videorotator.com/index.html)

 This rotator can literally move your move upside down, at 90 degrees, or turn it into a film like you are looking at it in a mirror. It supports a whole lot more formats than Movie Rotator and can even support the iPhone, iPod Touch or iPad as well as the usual MOV, MP4 and WMV file formats. Video Rotator 1.0.7 can even supports mass flipping of videos, so if you have around 50 or more to do, it'll rotate them all.

![free mov video rotator](https://images.wondershare.com/images/multimedia/video-editor/video-rotator.jpg "free mov video rotator")

**Pros:**

* Supports various video formats;
* Straightforward and easy-to-use.

**Cons:**

* Crashed occasionally.

#### [Rotate Video](http://www.rotatevideo.org/)

 What we liked about Rotate Video was the ability to rotate at just about any angle, with one simple click of your mouse. It supports all the major file formats including MPG, WMV or MP4 to name a few and it is remarkably simple to use. The only drawback we found was the 5MB limit on file size!

![free video roator](https://images.wondershare.com/images/multimedia/video-editor/rotate-video.jpg "free video roator")

**Pros:**

* Supported various video formats;
* No need to download.

 This is a very easy piece of software to use and enables anyone to easily change the rotation of your movies. It supports various video formats like MOV, AVI, MP4, WMV, MKV, 3GP and more. Once you get going it's easy to use, straightforward and uncomplicated.

![free mov video rotator](https://images.wondershare.com/images/multimedia/freemake.jpg)

**Pros:**

* Supports various video formats;
* Different video editing options;

#### [Any Video Converter](http://www.any-video-converter.com/products/for%5Fvideo%5Ffree/)

 Very easy to use and a simple interface, this software does more than simply rotate your videos. It will also rotate in batches and allow you to do some smart editing like trimming, cropping, clipping as well as rotating. It's a bit of all-singing, all-dancing rotating software as it also supports a huge amount of file formats, including MOV of course.

![top mov video rotator](https://images.wondershare.com/images/multimedia/video-editor/any-video-converter.jpg "top mov video rotator")

**Pros:**

Adding **Final Cut Pro subtitles and captions** is a great thing to expand your audience base, and thus the trend of adding captions and subtitles is becoming relevant day by day. There is a whole process to add Final Cut Pro captions and subtitles, which we are going to discuss below.

Let's check if there is any difference between captions and subtitles used in FCPX. Even though both these texts tend to appear at the bottom of the video screen, they have different purposes.

As we all know, subtitles depict foreign languages other than the language shown in the actual video. So, they are used to appearing on-screen frequently as the speaker speaks.

On the other hand, the captions display every kind of audio information, including sound effects, music, and background noises [(see how to remove background noise in FCPX here)](https://filmora.wondershare.com/final-cut-pro/remove-background-noise.html). Every Caption represents that viewer hasn't any audio clues and thus displays them over the video.

## Part 1: How to Add Subtitles/Captions in Final Cut Pro X?

Before you study the steps required to add subtitles to Final Cut Pro, here are some quick facts about the format of captions supported by FCPX.

* **ITT (iTunes Timed Text)**

It is required to deliver the contents of Caption to the iTunes store.

* **CEA-608 (SCC)**

It is a standard caption format for web videos and broadcasts.

* **SRT (SubRip)**

It is a simple and popular format used in online videos.

### Steps to Add Subtitles or Captions in FCPX

**Step 1: Create Caption Roles**

You need first to create caption roles to start adding captions to the timeline. Go to **Modify** \> **Edit Roles** and then select **Captions**. Then, select CEA-608, choose your language, and hit the Apply button.

**Step 2: Add Captions**

Position the playhead to where you have to set the Caption in the timeline. You need to hit the **Edit** tab and then select **Captions** \> **Add Caption**.

Select the drop-down menu across the language and select **CEA-608**.

Now, you can add captions in the preview window or the **Captions Text** given alongside.

Also, you can adjust the duration of the Caption by dragging it in the timeline.

**Step 3: Export a Caption Role**

Press **Command + E** or go to **File** \> **Export** to open the **Export** preview window. Now, you can select the name and save your video in standard export options. Hit the **Roles** tab given at the top.

Then, click the small **Captions** icon to reveal the menu. Select the subtitles or captions to import alongside the **Burn in Captions** tab. Hit the **OK** button and proceed with export as usual.

Thus, similar steps are required even if you want to add subtitles.

Too many steps? Then try a **beginner-friendly editing tool**, Filmora!

It also records the ending and starting timestamp for every Caption for further reference.

Adding **Final Cut Pro subtitles and captions** is a great thing to expand your audience base, and thus the trend of adding captions and subtitles is becoming relevant day by day. There is a whole process to add Final Cut Pro captions and subtitles, which we are going to discuss below.

Let's check if there is any difference between captions and subtitles used in FCPX. Even though both these texts tend to appear at the bottom of the video screen, they have different purposes.

As we all know, subtitles depict foreign languages other than the language shown in the actual video. So, they are used to appearing on-screen frequently as the speaker speaks.

On the other hand, the captions display every kind of audio information, including sound effects, music, and background noises [(see how to remove background noise in FCPX here)](https://filmora.wondershare.com/final-cut-pro/remove-background-noise.html). Every Caption represents that viewer hasn't any audio clues and thus displays them over the video.
