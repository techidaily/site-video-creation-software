## DAV Files Won't Play? How to Solve?

 _Posted by [Kaylee Wood](https://www.quora.com/profile/Amanda-Hu-21) | Last update: April 28, 2020_

_"Does anyone know how to play a .dav file on your MacBook? I have a DVD that has a DAV file on it. Does any know of an application that would play the DAV file on my Mac?"_ \- discussions.apple.com

Yes, playing DAV files in Windows is not as hard as playing DAV files in Mac OS as there is a free DVR 365 Player software only for Windows PC, but there is no DAV player for Mac. Even VLC – which was known as "the player that simply plays everything" can do nothing about DAV files. 

However, what if I tell you that there is just one perfect DAV player that could open DAV files on both Mac and Windows without hiccups, which means that you can stop your hunting for DAV player and also stop converting DAV to other main stream video formats at the cost of degrading video quality. Ok, the DAV player is called – [5KPlayer](https://tools.techidaily.com/5kplayer/products/).

### DAV Video Not Playing? Why Is It So Difficult to Play?

DAV is an encrypted format created by a DVR 365\. The DVR 365 video file is originally created with a video recording device such as a closed-circuit television system, certain models of video cameras and certain models of DVRs. DAV files are saved in an MPEG format and are encrypted, so it makes sense that the standard media players like VLC or QuickTime won't playing DAV. 

There are some people suggested that since there is no DAV player for Mac OS X, you can apply a DAV converter for Mac to convert DAV files to MOV/MP4/AVI on Mac. But most CCTV systems use a proprietary codec, so it is also hard to change the video type.
