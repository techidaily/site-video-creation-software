This is perhaps the most asked question regarding video processing on the internet. And looking at the product descriptions on the Adobe site gives us a clue why. There seems to be a large overlap between the two programs, and technically there is, although as we shall see capability doesn't always mean suitability, so the similarities are not quite as pronounced as they would appear.

With that in mind, it is worth looking at the key differences between [After Effects](https://tools.techidaily.com/wondershare/filmora/download/) and Premiere to get a clearer understanding of what is best for which situation and why you would pick one program over the other. So below are the 9 points that I will make a comparison.

#### Comparison Table

| After Effects                      | Adobe Premiere                            |                                     |
| ---------------------------------- | ----------------------------------------- | ----------------------------------- |

This is a basic tutorial about Adobe Premiere, professional video editing software. However, if video editing is new to you, consider [Wondershare Filmora](https://tools.techidaily.com/wondershare/filmora/download/), which is a powerful but easy-to-use tool for users just starting out. Download the free trial version below.

## After Effects VS Adobe Premiere

#### 1Timeline

There are numerous editing differences between the two programs, but we will start with the timeline as it perhaps best illustrates the different focus of each package. Premiere has a very detailed timeline panel with a huge amount of functionality built in to move through and manipulate the contents of a project. After Effects, on the other hand, has less options for dealing with multiple clips and is designed to deal with the composite components in a more user friendly way.

The upshot of this would be the basic premise of the differences, for editing clips into a movie, whilst both can perform the task to an extent, Premiere's timeline interface makes it a much easier process with many more options to make technical editing easier for the user.

![Adobe Premiere vs After Effects](https://images.wondershare.com/images/multimedia/video-editor/affer-effect-1.png)

#### 2Editing

In addition to the timeline, Premiere has an interface and toolset built for precise editing and clip manipulation, both audio and video. This is not surprising of course, Premiere is after all first and foremost an editing package. By contrast, whilst there is editing functionality within After Effects, it is neither as user friendly, nor remotely as comprehensive a tool set, and as such would not be a suitable environment for extensive editing workflow.

This is perhaps the crux of the differences between the two packages, for editing work Premiere offers a complete toolset far beyond the requirements for many projects, but as comprehensive as one wishes, whilst After Effects is focus more on composites and motion video work and has an editing tool set that is not conducive to efficiency and ease of use.

![Adobe Premiere vs After Effects](https://images.wondershare.com/images/multimedia/video-editor/affer-effect-2.png)

#### 3Audio Mixer

In today's market the audio component on a video product can be as important as the visual aspects, the audio clip mixer within Premiere is a professional grade tool designed to offer precise control over a projects audio output and includes the ability to use VST3 industry standard plugins. Because After Effects is primarily a composite application it lacks the finesse of Premiere where audio is concerned. Again this shouldn't be read as being an inferior program, it simply has a different focus.

![Adobe Premiere vs After Effects](https://images.wondershare.com/images/multimedia/video-editor/affer-effect-3.jpg)

#### 4Mercury Playback Engine

In terms of perceived functionality probably not the top of the list, but Premiere uses this to employ either software (useful) or hardware (brilliant), assuming you have a compatible graphics card, accelerated real time renderless viewing of clips and sequences. This creates a much faster workflow for editing than is possible with After Effects beyond the previously mentioned tools and interface restrictions.

![Adobe Premiere vs After Effects](https://images.wondershare.com/images/multimedia/video-editor/affer-effect-4.jpg)

#### 5 Multicam

In terms of editing this is where After Effects just isn't comparable at all, the multi camera interface within Premiere is exceptionally featured and allows on the fly angle changes and edits and the ability to sync a single shot through numerous camera simultaneously. As said, the editing functionality on offer here is what Premiere exists for, and whilst both Premiere and After Effects are video manipulation packages, editing and composting are very different focuses, and the products reflect those differences.

![Adobe Premiere vs After Effects](https://images.wondershare.com/images/multimedia/video-editor/affer-effect-5.jpg)

#### 6Media Management

Often overlooked but very important for project fidelity, the media management facilities within Premiere are designed around the needs of editing production and enable a much easier organizational approach for large projects than that of After Effects.

![Adobe Premiere vs After Effects](https://images.wondershare.com/images/multimedia/video-editor/affer-effect-6.jpg)

#### 7Masking

This is where After Effects comes to the fore. The ability to create masks that track through scenes is a fundamental component of After Effects workflow and why it is so good for effects creation and compositing. None of these effects are readily achievable within Premiere as it ships, and even add ons will never achieve the fluidity and ease of use the purpose designed interface provides.

![Adobe Premiere vs After Effects](https://images.wondershare.com/images/multimedia/video-editor/affer-effect-7.jpg)

#### 8 Camera Tracker

The 3D camera tracker within After Effects is an incredibly useful tool designed to replicate the camera movements within a given scene to allow new layers to be added that precisely match the original scene, essential for composite work and simply not possible within Premiere.

![Adobe Premiere vs After Effects](https://images.wondershare.com/images/multimedia/video-editor/affer-effect-8.jpg)

#### 9 Effects

The collection of specific tools within After Effects for applying motion control effects, for color control, blurring shadows transitions and titles is vast, and whilst Premiere includes some of its own, it is clear that here After Effects has the edge and it once again highlights the different approach taken by each program. Premiere is primarily an editing application, it is designed to enable the fastest, most efficient and highest quality non-linear editing of a project possible. Within that framework it includes the ability, both natively and with plugins, to incorporate a limited range transitions and effects to aid the editing process.

After Effects, however, is an application built around effects, it is designed to allow an almost unlimited variety of effects, transitions and animations to be incorporated into a project via compositing and as such has a wealth of tools to enable the efficient workflow of those tasks, including some editing tools that would likely be needed for that job.

![Adobe Premiere vs After Effects](https://images.wondershare.com/images/multimedia/video-editor/affer-effect-9.png)

## Conclusion

I've seen it explained before in terms of Word and Excel. You can compose a letter in Excel and create a spreadsheet in Word with the tables functionality, but the end result will take much longer and never be quite as good doing it that way. This perhaps is the best way to explain the relationship between Premiere and After Effects.

Yes, a spec sheet makes the two programs seem somewhat comparable, but it is the focus of each application that shows why they differ so much. Ultimately, the best use of these programs is together, they complement each other perfectly.

## After Effects VS Adobe Premiere

#### 1Timeline

There are numerous editing differences between the two programs, but we will start with the timeline as it perhaps best illustrates the different focus of each package. Premiere has a very detailed timeline panel with a huge amount of functionality built in to move through and manipulate the contents of a project. After Effects, on the other hand, has less options for dealing with multiple clips and is designed to deal with the composite components in a more user friendly way.

The upshot of this would be the basic premise of the differences, for editing clips into a movie, whilst both can perform the task to an extent, Premiere's timeline interface makes it a much easier process with many more options to make technical editing easier for the user.

![Adobe Premiere vs After Effects](https://images.wondershare.com/images/multimedia/video-editor/affer-effect-1.png)

#### 2Editing

In addition to the timeline, Premiere has an interface and toolset built for precise editing and clip manipulation, both audio and video. This is not surprising of course, Premiere is after all first and foremost an editing package. By contrast, whilst there is editing functionality within After Effects, it is neither as user friendly, nor remotely as comprehensive a tool set, and as such would not be a suitable environment for extensive editing workflow.

This is perhaps the crux of the differences between the two packages, for editing work Premiere offers a complete toolset far beyond the requirements for many projects, but as comprehensive as one wishes, whilst After Effects is focus more on composites and motion video work and has an editing tool set that is not conducive to efficiency and ease of use.

![Adobe Premiere vs After Effects](https://images.wondershare.com/images/multimedia/video-editor/affer-effect-2.png)

#### 3Audio Mixer

In today's market the audio component on a video product can be as important as the visual aspects, the audio clip mixer within Premiere is a professional grade tool designed to offer precise control over a projects audio output and includes the ability to use VST3 industry standard plugins. Because After Effects is primarily a composite application it lacks the finesse of Premiere where audio is concerned. Again this shouldn't be read as being an inferior program, it simply has a different focus.

![Adobe Premiere vs After Effects](https://images.wondershare.com/images/multimedia/video-editor/affer-effect-3.jpg)

#### 4Mercury Playback Engine

In terms of perceived functionality probably not the top of the list, but Premiere uses this to employ either software (useful) or hardware (brilliant), assuming you have a compatible graphics card, accelerated real time renderless viewing of clips and sequences. This creates a much faster workflow for editing than is possible with After Effects beyond the previously mentioned tools and interface restrictions.

![Adobe Premiere vs After Effects](https://images.wondershare.com/images/multimedia/video-editor/affer-effect-4.jpg)

#### 5 Multicam

In terms of editing this is where After Effects just isn't comparable at all, the multi camera interface within Premiere is exceptionally featured and allows on the fly angle changes and edits and the ability to sync a single shot through numerous camera simultaneously. As said, the editing functionality on offer here is what Premiere exists for, and whilst both Premiere and After Effects are video manipulation packages, editing and composting are very different focuses, and the products reflect those differences.

![Adobe Premiere vs After Effects](https://images.wondershare.com/images/multimedia/video-editor/affer-effect-5.jpg)

#### 6Media Management

Often overlooked but very important for project fidelity, the media management facilities within Premiere are designed around the needs of editing production and enable a much easier organizational approach for large projects than that of After Effects.

![Adobe Premiere vs After Effects](https://images.wondershare.com/images/multimedia/video-editor/affer-effect-6.jpg)

#### 7Masking

This is where After Effects comes to the fore. The ability to create masks that track through scenes is a fundamental component of After Effects workflow and why it is so good for effects creation and compositing. None of these effects are readily achievable within Premiere as it ships, and even add ons will never achieve the fluidity and ease of use the purpose designed interface provides.

![Adobe Premiere vs After Effects](https://images.wondershare.com/images/multimedia/video-editor/affer-effect-7.jpg)

#### 8 Camera Tracker

The 3D camera tracker within After Effects is an incredibly useful tool designed to replicate the camera movements within a given scene to allow new layers to be added that precisely match the original scene, essential for composite work and simply not possible within Premiere.

![Adobe Premiere vs After Effects](https://images.wondershare.com/images/multimedia/video-editor/affer-effect-8.jpg)

#### 9 Effects

The collection of specific tools within After Effects for applying motion control effects, for color control, blurring shadows transitions and titles is vast, and whilst Premiere includes some of its own, it is clear that here After Effects has the edge and it once again highlights the different approach taken by each program. Premiere is primarily an editing application, it is designed to enable the fastest, most efficient and highest quality non-linear editing of a project possible. Within that framework it includes the ability, both natively and with plugins, to incorporate a limited range transitions and effects to aid the editing process.

After Effects, however, is an application built around effects, it is designed to allow an almost unlimited variety of effects, transitions and animations to be incorporated into a project via compositing and as such has a wealth of tools to enable the efficient workflow of those tasks, including some editing tools that would likely be needed for that job.

![Adobe Premiere vs After Effects](https://images.wondershare.com/images/multimedia/video-editor/affer-effect-9.png)

## Conclusion

I've seen it explained before in terms of Word and Excel. You can compose a letter in Excel and create a spreadsheet in Word with the tables functionality, but the end result will take much longer and never be quite as good doing it that way. This perhaps is the best way to explain the relationship between Premiere and After Effects.

Yes, a spec sheet makes the two programs seem somewhat comparable, but it is the focus of each application that shows why they differ so much. Ultimately, the best use of these programs is together, they complement each other perfectly.

As we use our mobile phones for producing and watching videos more and more every year, the demand for advanced options is constantly on the rise. Split screen is one of such options that users expect from their video apps nowadays, and products that include it stand a better chance to gain a steady foothold in the market. As a response, many new video tools equipped with the [split screen](https://tools.techidaily.com/wondershare/filmora/download/) are being launched, but not all of them offer the same level of technical quality and user experience.

To help you differentiate between the competing apps and select the one that works best for you, we prepared an overview of the best split screen video apps for iOS and Android you can use to record, create, and share great-looking multimedia with minimal effort.

### 1\. [iMovie](https://apps.apple.com/us/app/imovie/id377298193)

**Availability:** iOS

 **Price:** Free

This is Appleâ€™s own video app and it is generally regarded as one of the better in its class, especially considering itâ€™s free to download. The app allows users to shoot, edit, and publish their videos and basically acts as a full-scale portable production studio capable of creating professional-looking movie trailers or even short films. Among the numerous advanced features, iMovie supports split-screen and picture-in-picture options, while also making it very simple to add titles or credits in a wide variety of styles. Because of this, it can be sufficient for anyone whose editing needs are not too complex. Even professional users can start working in iMovie before switching to a more robust Apple editing tool such as Final Cut Pro X.

### 2\. [PicPlay Post Movie Video Editor](https://play.google.com/store/apps/details?id=com.flambestudios.picplaypost&hl=en)

**Availability:** iOS, Android

 **Price:** Free

![Split Screen Video Making App - PicPlayPost ](https://images.wondershare.com/filmora/article-images/picplaypost-movie-video-editor.jpg)

This versatile tool can be used to create and edit video clips or photo collages with a broad range of eye-catching features. It supports the split screen option with up to 9 tiles organized in a 3 x 3 pattern, and offers a lot of pre-defined backgrounds and layouts. Most importantly, you can choose between 9:16 and 16:9 aspect ratios, so the outgoing clips are ready for sharing on any social media platform in landscape or portrait orientation. Itâ€™s perfect for creating simple side-by-side comparisons as well as more complex collages that consist of still photos, GIFs, and video clips. The app is easy to use and requires very little training to achieve spectacular results.

### 3\. [Video Collage and Photo Grid](https://apps.apple.com/us/app/video-collage-and-photo-grid/id779353036)

**Availability:** iOS

 **Price:** Free

![Split Screen Video Making App - Video Collage and Photo Grid ](https://images.wondershare.com/filmora/article-images/video-collage-and-photo-grid.jpg)

The advantage of any specialized app is that it can perform the chosen function very well, and in the case of a video collage app that means a lot of split screen presets and customization opportunities. You can choose from 64 different layouts featuring up to four videos that can play at the same time. All layouts can be manually adjusted to get the best possible fit with your content, while frame textures can be changed as well. The resulting video collage can be combined with music for a true multimedia feel. Instant preview is a very useful feature as well since it allows the authors to experiment freely while they are searching for the perfect layout of the screen.

### 4\. [Split Screen Video](https://apps.apple.com/us/app/split-screen-videos/id1141913470#?platform=iphone)

**Availability:** iOS

 **Price:** $2.99

![Split Screen Video Making App -Split Screen Video ](https://images.wondershare.com/filmora/article-images/split-screen-videos-app.jpg)

With this simple digital tool, you can easily combine from two to four videos into a great, dynamic clip. This is an Apple-only application and has a modest price considering the range of its features. Videos can be placed into frames, and their size and style can be adjusted at will so that some tiles are larger than others. For those who enjoy speed and convenience, there are six preset layouts that can be used to quickly put together a stunning split screen video. Since the interface is extremely user-friendly, this can take as little as a few minutes to execute.

### 5\. [Perfect Video Editor, Collage](https://apps.apple.com/us/app/perfect-video-editor-collage/id633335631)

**Availability:** iOS

 **Price:** Free

![Split Screen Video Making App - Perfect Video Editor, Collage](https://images.wondershare.com/filmora/article-images/perfect-video-editor-collage.jpg)

There are numerous advantages of this split screen video app, starting from the simplicity of use that makes it ideal for beginners and casual users. Perfect Video Editor supports practically every aspect ratio you can think of, so it works well as a universal editing tool regardless of the intended use of the video. The split screen feature is sadly limited to just two video channels, somewhat limiting the range of options at your disposal. Picture and picture and chroma key features can partially make up for this limitation, along with animated subtitles and great transitions that add some extra oomph to the final product.

### 6 [Vidstitch Frames for Instagram](https://apps.apple.com/us/app/vidstitch-frames-for-instagram/id712908978)

**Availability:** iOS, Android

 **Price:** Free

![Split Screen Video Making App - Vidstitch Frames for Instagram](https://images.wondershare.com/filmora/article-images/vidstitch-frames-for-instagram.jpg)

You can do a lot of different things with this video editing app, although itâ€™s best suited for the creation of Instagram videos. The free version is available for both major OS platforms, but in order to use full features on your iPhone, you might need to make a $0.99 in-app purchase. The app lets you combine photos and videos, and place them into one of many predefined and fully adjustable split screen frames and collage formats. However, this app works best with clips made from your own phone and may not be the best choice if you need to import multimedia from diverse sources. Considering that most social media users these days shoot and edit their clips in the same breath, Vidstitch Frames could be sufficiently advanced for their needs.

### 7\. [Acapella](https://apps.apple.com/us/app/acapella-from-picplaypost/id924635678)

**Availability:** iOS, Android

 **Price:** Free

![Split Screen Video Making App - Acapella](https://images.wondershare.com/filmora/article-images/acapella-from-picplaypost.jpg)

While this is primarily a music editing app, it can also be used with reasonable success for creating and sharing videos. Most importantly, it supports multi-frame layouts and allows you to combine several video clips to accompany the multi-track sound. Various frames and backgrounds are available to use as plug-and-play elements while you are making a new split screen video. The songs and videos you can record with Acapella are limited to 10 minutes in duration, although this should be more than enough for all except the most ambitious users. On the other hand, demanding users who primarily want to edit videos rather than music can probably find a better split screen app.

### 8\. [Video Merge, Side by Side](https://play.google.com/store/apps/details?id=com.irisstudio.videomerge&hl=en%5FUS&gl=US)

**Availability:** Android

 **Price:** Free

![Split Screen Video Making App - Video Merge, Side by Side](https://images.wondershare.com/filmora/article-images/video-merge-side-by-side.jpg)

Installing this Android app will instantly enable you to create unique videos by merging two different clips into one. The app shows both streams together and can place them side by side or one atop of another, depending on user preference. This is a great way to show two different shots of the same event or summarize the footage from your travels without spending a ton of time. While the app is very intuitive and easy to learn, it canâ€™t work with more than two video sources and it sorely lacks some of the more sophisticated features that a premium split screen video editor should have.

### 9\. [4xcamera](https://www.roland.com/us/products/4xcamera/)

**Availability:** iOS, Android

 **Price:** Free

As its name implies, 4Xcamera can handle up to four independent inputs containing both video and audio components. As such, it can be a powerful tool for recording live music performances and editing the footage to get amazing multi-screen music videos. Each of the performers can be in a separate location, but this split screen app allows for simultaneous recording and real-time playback in a very effortless fashion. Three aspect ratios are supported (1:1, 9:16, and 16:9), along with 10 unique split screen patterns for each of those formats. The free version is available from the App Store as well as Google Play, although paid features might be necessary for the best possible results.

### 10\. [Multiple Videos at Same Time](https://play.google.com/store/apps/details?id=com.badongutech.playvideos4fun&hl=en%5FUS&gl=US)

**Availability:** Android

 **Price:** Free

This practical and intuitive split screen software can play up to four different videos at the same time, albeit only in the basic layout with four equally sized fields. It is best suited for playback rather than video editing, and most of the options are basic viewing-related commands such as rewinding, searching, or volume control. On a more positive note, this app can be easily connected to a large screen TV or a movie projector and used for multi-screen promotions and presentations. The app has minimal hardware requirements and is extremely easy to use, even for a person with no experience in multimedia production. Itâ€™s fair to say that the app has a clearly defined target group and serves well in its primary role, but it doesnâ€™t compare favorably with some of the general purpose editors presented earlier.

**Conclusion**

The field is quite broad when it comes to split screen video apps, with numerous high-quality products available for free or at a low cost. The most optimal choice of editing software depends on numerous factors, including the level of experience and the purpose of the videos. With so many options to choose from, every advanced social media user can create brilliant videos that combine multiple sources and create a dynamic, modern format. It takes some practice to master the split screen tool and get the layout just right without overwhelming the viewer, but this is easier to achieve when you have professional-level editing tools installed on your smartphone.

![Split Screen Video Making App - Vidstitch Frames for Instagram](https://images.wondershare.com/filmora/article-images/vidstitch-frames-for-instagram.jpg)

You can do a lot of different things with this video editing app, although itâ€™s best suited for the creation of Instagram videos. The free version is available for both major OS platforms, but in order to use full features on your iPhone, you might need to make a $0.99 in-app purchase. The app lets you combine photos and videos, and place them into one of many predefined and fully adjustable split screen frames and collage formats. However, this app works best with clips made from your own phone and may not be the best choice if you need to import multimedia from diverse sources. Considering that most social media users these days shoot and edit their clips in the same breath, Vidstitch Frames could be sufficiently advanced for their needs.

### 7\. [Acapella](https://apps.apple.com/us/app/acapella-from-picplaypost/id924635678)

**Availability:** iOS, Android

 **Price:** Free

![Split Screen Video Making App - Acapella](https://images.wondershare.com/filmora/article-images/acapella-from-picplaypost.jpg)

While this is primarily a music editing app, it can also be used with reasonable success for creating and sharing videos. Most importantly, it supports multi-frame layouts and allows you to combine several video clips to accompany the multi-track sound. Various frames and backgrounds are available to use as plug-and-play elements while you are making a new split screen video. The songs and videos you can record with Acapella are limited to 10 minutes in duration, although this should be more than enough for all except the most ambitious users. On the other hand, demanding users who primarily want to edit videos rather than music can probably find a better split screen app.

### 8\. [Video Merge, Side by Side](https://play.google.com/store/apps/details?id=com.irisstudio.videomerge&hl=en%5FUS&gl=US)

**Availability:** Android

 **Price:** Free

![Split Screen Video Making App - Video Merge, Side by Side](https://images.wondershare.com/filmora/article-images/video-merge-side-by-side.jpg)

Installing this Android app will instantly enable you to create unique videos by merging two different clips into one. The app shows both streams together and can place them side by side or one atop of another, depending on user preference. This is a great way to show two different shots of the same event or summarize the footage from your travels without spending a ton of time. While the app is very intuitive and easy to learn, it canâ€™t work with more than two video sources and it sorely lacks some of the more sophisticated features that a premium split screen video editor should have.

### 9\. [4xcamera](https://www.roland.com/us/products/4xcamera/)

**Availability:** iOS, Android

 **Price:** Free

As its name implies, 4Xcamera can handle up to four independent inputs containing both video and audio components. As such, it can be a powerful tool for recording live music performances and editing the footage to get amazing multi-screen music videos. Each of the performers can be in a separate location, but this split screen app allows for simultaneous recording and real-time playback in a very effortless fashion. Three aspect ratios are supported (1:1, 9:16, and 16:9), along with 10 unique split screen patterns for each of those formats. The free version is available from the App Store as well as Google Play, although paid features might be necessary for the best possible results.

### 10\. [Multiple Videos at Same Time](https://play.google.com/store/apps/details?id=com.badongutech.playvideos4fun&hl=en%5FUS&gl=US)

**Availability:** Android

 **Price:** Free

This practical and intuitive split screen software can play up to four different videos at the same time, albeit only in the basic layout with four equally sized fields. It is best suited for playback rather than video editing, and most of the options are basic viewing-related commands such as rewinding, searching, or volume control. On a more positive note, this app can be easily connected to a large screen TV or a movie projector and used for multi-screen promotions and presentations. The app has minimal hardware requirements and is extremely easy to use, even for a person with no experience in multimedia production. Itâ€™s fair to say that the app has a clearly defined target group and serves well in its primary role, but it doesnâ€™t compare favorably with some of the general purpose editors presented earlier.

**Conclusion**

The field is quite broad when it comes to split screen video apps, with numerous high-quality products available for free or at a low cost. The most optimal choice of editing software depends on numerous factors, including the level of experience and the purpose of the videos. With so many options to choose from, every advanced social media user can create brilliant videos that combine multiple sources and create a dynamic, modern format. It takes some practice to master the split screen tool and get the layout just right without overwhelming the viewer, but this is easier to achieve when you have professional-level editing tools installed on your smartphone.

As we use our mobile phones for producing and watching videos more and more every year, the demand for advanced options is constantly on the rise. Split screen is one of such options that users expect from their video apps nowadays, and products that include it stand a better chance to gain a steady foothold in the market. As a response, many new video tools equipped with the [split screen](https://tools.techidaily.com/wondershare/filmora/download/) are being launched, but not all of them offer the same level of technical quality and user experience.

To help you differentiate between the competing apps and select the one that works best for you, we prepared an overview of the best split screen video apps for iOS and Android you can use to record, create, and share great-looking multimedia with minimal effort.

### 1\. [iMovie](https://apps.apple.com/us/app/imovie/id377298193)

**Availability:** iOS

 **Price:** Free

This is Appleâ€™s own video app and it is generally regarded as one of the better in its class, especially considering itâ€™s free to download. The app allows users to shoot, edit, and publish their videos and basically acts as a full-scale portable production studio capable of creating professional-looking movie trailers or even short films. Among the numerous advanced features, iMovie supports split-screen and picture-in-picture options, while also making it very simple to add titles or credits in a wide variety of styles. Because of this, it can be sufficient for anyone whose editing needs are not too complex. Even professional users can start working in iMovie before switching to a more robust Apple editing tool such as Final Cut Pro X.

### 2\. [PicPlay Post Movie Video Editor](https://play.google.com/store/apps/details?id=com.flambestudios.picplaypost&hl=en)

**Availability:** iOS, Android

 **Price:** Free

![Split Screen Video Making App - PicPlayPost ](https://images.wondershare.com/filmora/article-images/picplaypost-movie-video-editor.jpg)

This versatile tool can be used to create and edit video clips or photo collages with a broad range of eye-catching features. It supports the split screen option with up to 9 tiles organized in a 3 x 3 pattern, and offers a lot of pre-defined backgrounds and layouts. Most importantly, you can choose between 9:16 and 16:9 aspect ratios, so the outgoing clips are ready for sharing on any social media platform in landscape or portrait orientation. Itâ€™s perfect for creating simple side-by-side comparisons as well as more complex collages that consist of still photos, GIFs, and video clips. The app is easy to use and requires very little training to achieve spectacular results.

### 3\. [Video Collage and Photo Grid](https://apps.apple.com/us/app/video-collage-and-photo-grid/id779353036)

**Availability:** iOS

 **Price:** Free

![Split Screen Video Making App - Video Collage and Photo Grid ](https://images.wondershare.com/filmora/article-images/video-collage-and-photo-grid.jpg)

The advantage of any specialized app is that it can perform the chosen function very well, and in the case of a video collage app that means a lot of split screen presets and customization opportunities. You can choose from 64 different layouts featuring up to four videos that can play at the same time. All layouts can be manually adjusted to get the best possible fit with your content, while frame textures can be changed as well. The resulting video collage can be combined with music for a true multimedia feel. Instant preview is a very useful feature as well since it allows the authors to experiment freely while they are searching for the perfect layout of the screen.

### 4\. [Split Screen Video](https://apps.apple.com/us/app/split-screen-videos/id1141913470#?platform=iphone)

**Availability:** iOS

 **Price:** $2.99

![Split Screen Video Making App -Split Screen Video ](https://images.wondershare.com/filmora/article-images/split-screen-videos-app.jpg)

With this simple digital tool, you can easily combine from two to four videos into a great, dynamic clip. This is an Apple-only application and has a modest price considering the range of its features. Videos can be placed into frames, and their size and style can be adjusted at will so that some tiles are larger than others. For those who enjoy speed and convenience, there are six preset layouts that can be used to quickly put together a stunning split screen video. Since the interface is extremely user-friendly, this can take as little as a few minutes to execute.

### 5\. [Perfect Video Editor, Collage](https://apps.apple.com/us/app/perfect-video-editor-collage/id633335631)

**Availability:** iOS

 **Price:** Free

![Split Screen Video Making App - Perfect Video Editor, Collage](https://images.wondershare.com/filmora/article-images/perfect-video-editor-collage.jpg)

There are numerous advantages of this split screen video app, starting from the simplicity of use that makes it ideal for beginners and casual users. Perfect Video Editor supports practically every aspect ratio you can think of, so it works well as a universal editing tool regardless of the intended use of the video. The split screen feature is sadly limited to just two video channels, somewhat limiting the range of options at your disposal. Picture and picture and chroma key features can partially make up for this limitation, along with animated subtitles and great transitions that add some extra oomph to the final product.

### 6 [Vidstitch Frames for Instagram](https://apps.apple.com/us/app/vidstitch-frames-for-instagram/id712908978)

### 10\. [Multiple Videos at Same Time](https://play.google.com/store/apps/details?id=com.badongutech.playvideos4fun&hl=en%5FUS&gl=US)

**Availability:** Android

 **Price:** Free

This practical and intuitive split screen software can play up to four different videos at the same time, albeit only in the basic layout with four equally sized fields. It is best suited for playback rather than video editing, and most of the options are basic viewing-related commands such as rewinding, searching, or volume control. On a more positive note, this app can be easily connected to a large screen TV or a movie projector and used for multi-screen promotions and presentations. The app has minimal hardware requirements and is extremely easy to use, even for a person with no experience in multimedia production. Itâ€™s fair to say that the app has a clearly defined target group and serves well in its primary role, but it doesnâ€™t compare favorably with some of the general purpose editors presented earlier.

**Conclusion**

The field is quite broad when it comes to split screen video apps, with numerous high-quality products available for free or at a low cost. The most optimal choice of editing software depends on numerous factors, including the level of experience and the purpose of the videos. With so many options to choose from, every advanced social media user can create brilliant videos that combine multiple sources and create a dynamic, modern format. It takes some practice to master the split screen tool and get the layout just right without overwhelming the viewer, but this is easier to achieve when you have professional-level editing tools installed on your smartphone.
