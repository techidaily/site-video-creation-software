## Part 4: Top 5 Warp Stabilizer Tips and Troubleshooting

 **Premiere Pro stabilize** is a powerful tool, but it also carries some limitations. Let's check them out!

**1\. Consider warp stabilize during shooting:**

If you keep in mind the warp stabilizer function while filming your videos or photos, you'll get rid of fixing problems after the work. So, if you want glossy touch in your shots with zero access to a gimbal, you should consider filming with a faster shutter speed or a wider frame. In this way, you'll get more convenience while applying the effect in the edit.

**2\. Modify extra cropping in your footage:**

Warp stabilizer is a tool that can provide you stable footage and crop your shot as well. It can crop out the edges of your photos or videos, giving you a smooth and clean shot. To adjust the cropping in your clips, go to advanced settings and then click on Crop less <-> Smooth More Slider.

**3\. Analyze the effect of Warp stabilizer:**

Always check the order of effects in the ''Effect Controls'' folder. If you ever lost some stabilization after editing your shot, ensure not to change the Warp Stabilizer analysis source. Further, you should always re-analyze your clip after a quick color fix.

**4\. Nest your clips:**

Sometimes we got an error message in the form of a red banner across our footage while trying to modify the speed on **premiere stabilize video**. Basically, we can't use a Warp stabilizer to alter the speed of the same clip. But no worries! There is an easy fix – click on the altered clip and then click on Nest. Now, you can fix the nested sequence without any trouble.

**5\. Save your favorite settings as a preset:**

If you've found a setting that gives you a happy result, you can save it as a preset for future use. In this way, you can speed up your work nicely while working with numerous shaky clips. Also, it can help if you want to make a similar effect to your multiple projects. Moreover, keep in mind that the Warp stabilizer needs to assess each clip frame by frame because it is not a one-size model that can fit all footage. Therefore, remember to click the ''Analyze'' button even after putting the preset to turn it on.

## Part 5: How to Stabilize Shaky Footage Without Using Warp Stabilizer?

Sometimes, the shakiness of clips is too extreme, and the Warp Stabilizer effect can't handle it. Moreover, the filter algorithm incorrectly compensates for the camera moves. So what strategy should apply in this condition? Luckily, there is a method that can be used to stabilize your clips without using a warp stabilizer. Moreover, this process can give a hyper-realistic effect to your footage!

**Step1:** Import your clip into Premiere Pro Project and add it to your timeline. Hit on the "clip", choose "Replace with After Effects Composition" to import the clip.

**Step 2:** Tap on the ''Tracker panel'' from the right side of the screen. Scroll down to the ''Track Motion'' option and open it.

**Step 3:** Pick the tracker marker, drag it to an area of contrasting subject and adjust it accordingly.

![adobe premiere pro track motion](https://images.wondershare.com/filmora/article-images/adobe-premiere-pro-track-motion.jpg)

Tip: Remember not to make the outer box too large as After Effects can have a hard time performing the track.

**Step 4:** Hit the play button in the ''Tracker panel'' to initiate the After Effects. Create a new ''Null Object'' after the tracking process is complete.

**Step 5:** Move to the Tracker panel, click on "Edit Target," choose your "Null Object" and click "OK."

**Step 6:** Create a new camera and parent it to the null object for applying the stabilization effect to your clips. Enable the 3D option on both the footage layer and the null object.

**Step 7:** Extend your footage to compensate for any black bars that can occur as the camera pays for the shakiness. That's it!

**Conclusion:**

Shaky footage is almost inescapable once you go handheld. If you don't have a manual stabilizer like a gimbal, a tripod, or a glide cam – your work can fall victim to running, wind, walking, or other elements. In this article, we've introduced a quick and fast antidote for shaky footage – a Warp Stabilizer effect in the Adobe Premiere Pro. It can smooth out your shaky photos or videos with just a few clicks. So, do you know how to **stabilize video premiere pro**? Read out the article!

## Part 4: Top 5 Warp Stabilizer Tips and Troubleshooting

 **Premiere Pro stabilize** is a powerful tool, but it also carries some limitations. Let's check them out!

**1\. Consider warp stabilize during shooting:**

If you keep in mind the warp stabilizer function while filming your videos or photos, you'll get rid of fixing problems after the work. So, if you want glossy touch in your shots with zero access to a gimbal, you should consider filming with a faster shutter speed or a wider frame. In this way, you'll get more convenience while applying the effect in the edit.

**2\. Modify extra cropping in your footage:**

Warp stabilizer is a tool that can provide you stable footage and crop your shot as well. It can crop out the edges of your photos or videos, giving you a smooth and clean shot. To adjust the cropping in your clips, go to advanced settings and then click on Crop less <-> Smooth More Slider.

**3\. Analyze the effect of Warp stabilizer:**

Always check the order of effects in the ''Effect Controls'' folder. If you ever lost some stabilization after editing your shot, ensure not to change the Warp Stabilizer analysis source. Further, you should always re-analyze your clip after a quick color fix.

**4\. Nest your clips:**

Sometimes we got an error message in the form of a red banner across our footage while trying to modify the speed on **premiere stabilize video**. Basically, we can't use a Warp stabilizer to alter the speed of the same clip. But no worries! There is an easy fix – click on the altered clip and then click on Nest. Now, you can fix the nested sequence without any trouble.

**5\. Save your favorite settings as a preset:**

If you've found a setting that gives you a happy result, you can save it as a preset for future use. In this way, you can speed up your work nicely while working with numerous shaky clips. Also, it can help if you want to make a similar effect to your multiple projects. Moreover, keep in mind that the Warp stabilizer needs to assess each clip frame by frame because it is not a one-size model that can fit all footage. Therefore, remember to click the ''Analyze'' button even after putting the preset to turn it on.

## Part 5: How to Stabilize Shaky Footage Without Using Warp Stabilizer?

Sometimes, the shakiness of clips is too extreme, and the Warp Stabilizer effect can't handle it. Moreover, the filter algorithm incorrectly compensates for the camera moves. So what strategy should apply in this condition? Luckily, there is a method that can be used to stabilize your clips without using a warp stabilizer. Moreover, this process can give a hyper-realistic effect to your footage!

**Step1:** Import your clip into Premiere Pro Project and add it to your timeline. Hit on the "clip", choose "Replace with After Effects Composition" to import the clip.

**Step 2:** Tap on the ''Tracker panel'' from the right side of the screen. Scroll down to the ''Track Motion'' option and open it.

**Step 3:** Pick the tracker marker, drag it to an area of contrasting subject and adjust it accordingly.

![adobe premiere pro track motion](https://images.wondershare.com/filmora/article-images/adobe-premiere-pro-track-motion.jpg)

Tip: Remember not to make the outer box too large as After Effects can have a hard time performing the track.

**Step 4:** Hit the play button in the ''Tracker panel'' to initiate the After Effects. Create a new ''Null Object'' after the tracking process is complete.

**Step 5:** Move to the Tracker panel, click on "Edit Target," choose your "Null Object" and click "OK."

**Step 6:** Create a new camera and parent it to the null object for applying the stabilization effect to your clips. Enable the 3D option on both the footage layer and the null object.

**Step 7:** Extend your footage to compensate for any black bars that can occur as the camera pays for the shakiness. That's it!

**Conclusion:**

Shaky footage is almost inescapable once you go handheld. If you don't have a manual stabilizer like a gimbal, a tripod, or a glide cam – your work can fall victim to running, wind, walking, or other elements. In this article, we've introduced a quick and fast antidote for shaky footage – a Warp Stabilizer effect in the Adobe Premiere Pro. It can smooth out your shaky photos or videos with just a few clicks. So, do you know how to **stabilize video premiere pro**? Read out the article!

The only downside is that Hyperlapse for Instagram doesn’t offer any video editing tools.

#### 5. [Framelapse](https://play.google.com/store/apps/details?id=com.Nishant.Singh.DroidTimelapse&hl=en)

**Price:** Free

**Compatibility:** Android 4.0 or later

**Rating**: 3.8

Adjusting the frame interval, enhancing the colors in a time-lapse video or selecting the orientation of the video are just a few among countless video recording options the Framelapse app provides. Furthermore, you can control the exposure and white balance values manually or even use the built-in calculator to find out how long the video recording session is going to last. The app allows you to stop recording automatically by setting the duration of the recording, while you can also choose the preferred bitrate or the resolution of the time-lapse video. The free version of Framelapse contains ads, but you can purchase the Pro version of the app that offers even more powerful time-lapse recording options for just $2.99.

**Conclusion**

You no longer need professional cameras, tripods, and [video editors](https://tools.techidaily.com/wondershare/filmora/download/) to create seamless time-lapse videos that depict the passage of time at a certain location. Instead, you can just download an iOS or Android-based app that enables you to have complete creative control over the process of capturing time-lapse videos and share them with your friends on social media. Which app are you going to be using to record time-lapse videos in 2019? Leave a comment and let us know.

 Adobe have recently released their new multi-platform video editing tool named [Adobe Rush](https://www.adobe.com/products/premiere-rush.html). It promises to be the first of its type in the world, allowing hassle video editing and publishing to a multitude of platforms.

![](https://images.wondershare.com/filmora/article-images/adobe-rush-alternatives-1.jpg)

 Dubbed the video editing tool for the YouTube generation, having been designed from the ground up for online video creators. Editing is simple via its suite of audio and visual tools, including title screens, transition effects and color adjustment tools. Export is optimized for all social platforms available, including Vimeo, Facebook, Twitter and Snapchat.

 Despite the promise of the perfect video editing tool, it's not been entirely warmly received. Some complain that the editing tools are just too basic, others that the price is uncompetitive. Other issues have been raised with slow rendering capabilities and general instability of the platform, causing crashes that can set projects back by hours.

 We're going to take a look at some of the alternatives to Adobe Rush out there, which may be more capable of getting the job done.

## Shortages of Adobe Rush

#### System requirements

| Devices                                                 | Requirements                |
| ------------------------------------------------------- | --------------------------- |
| PC                                                      | Windows 10 (v1709 or later) |
| 8 GB of RAM                                             |                             |
| 8 GB of available hard-disk space                       |                             |
| Multicore processor with 64-bit support                 |                             |

| 8 GB of RAM                                             |                             |
| 8 GB of available hard-disk space                       |                             |
| Multicore Intel processor with 64-bit support           |                             |
| iPhone/iPad                                             | iOS 11 or later             |
| iPhone 7 and newer (devices with A9 ARM chip or higher) |                             |
| Android                                                 | Not available now           |

 Windows users will need to be upgraded to the latest version of the operating system, at least version 1709 as a minimum. You'll also need at least 8GB of RAM if you want to avoid the system crashing every time you use it.

 Despite having computers that meet the required spec, numerous users have complained that Adobe Rush is buggy and repeatedly crashes. Some say that the laggy performance makes it almost impossible to use.

 An alternative is to use Rush on your iPhone, but for this you'll need to own at least an iPhone 7, preferably something newer. In testing, we found it to be very slow, even on an iPhone X. If you're an Android user, you'll need to wait to experience the 'Rush', because this software is not available for your handset yet. Adobe have said they are working on it and how to have it ready at some point in 2019.

#### Performance

 As a video editing tool, it's fairly competent, but for anything more than the basics, it's somewhat lacking. Many of the most basic video editing tools are missing, and the platform supports only three transitions, so if you're into making longer or more complex videos, its just not going to work.

 In terms of rendering, we found it incredibly slow in comparison to some of the alternatives to Adobe Rush. The background music choices are pretty limited too, and most of it is not what you want accompanying your cutting-edge videos.

 What really broke the deal for us was the inability to specify the output of your video files. This means that although social sharing could be OK, you're going to be stuck if you want to share it in other locations. It's great to see a video editing app on iPhone, but overall, it's really nothing special.

#### Price

 If you already subscribe to the Adobe Create Cloud (CC) suite, then Rush will be included in your subscription. However, if you want to subscribe to it as a standalone app, the price is $9.99 a month for individuals. This is not particularly competitive with the alternatives to Premier Rush, and could be prohibitively expensive for the hobbyist, which is, after all, the market Adobe are aiming at.

## Alternatives to Adobe Rush for All Platforms

 While Adobe are marketing Rush as a 'cross platform' video editor, there are alternatives to Premier Rush which do the job just as well, if not better, and often for a lot less.

**1\. For Windows - Wondershare Filmora**

 We love [Wondershare Filmora](https://tools.techidaily.com/wondershare/filmora/download/) as an alternative to Adobe Rush for Windows. Unlike Rush, you can pick and choose your video output format, as Filmora is compatible with all major video file types including mp4, FLV, MKV, AVI, MOV and more. Instead of being limited to a handful of basic effects, Filmora supports more than [300 high performance effects](https://effects.wondershare.com/) and filters to perfect your visual appeal.

[![Download Win Version](https://images.wondershare.com/filmora/article-images/download-btn-win.jpg)](https://tools.techidaily.com/wondershare/filmora/download/)[Download Mac Version](https://images.wondershare.com/filmora/article-images/download-btn-mac.jpg)](https://tools.techidaily.com/wondershare/filmora/download/)

 As well as being a video editor, Filmora is a working audio editor too, featuring a full mixer and equalizer to bring your music and speech to life. There're no transitional limitations, and you can even use green-screen technology, tilt-shift and jump cut features to make your videos pop.

![](https://images.wondershare.com/filmora/article-images/adobe-rush-alternatives-filmora-9.jpg)

 Each video can use up to 99 timelines to make it easier to edit and customize your work. Finally, and a big plus for many of us, you don't need to have the latest and best PC in order to use this software. Wondershare Filmora works on Windows 7, 8 and 10, and requires only 3GB of RAM. If you want to work in HD or 4K quality, however, you will need 8GB RAM.

**2\. For Mac - iMovie**

[iMovie](https://www.apple.com/imovie/) is a powerful editing tool designed for iOS and perfect to use on a Mac. Using your own photos and videos, you can create polished movies complete with titles and even a credits roll. It's great for turning memories into beautiful keepsakes, which can then be shared with family and friends via social media or direct from your Apple device.

 Check this article to see the[comparison between Adobe Rush and Apple iMovie](https://tools.techidaily.com/wondershare/filmora/download/)

![](https://images.wondershare.com/filmora/article-images/adobe-rush-alternative-imovie.jpg)

 The user-friendly interface makes it possible for even the most novice of users to harness the power of digital video editing. Complete with templates and easy to use tools, even beginners can make high quality trailers, logos and cinema like productions.

 iMovie lets users access a number of special effects and enhancements, as well as ten filters to improve the images. Music can be chosen from their own library, and narrative voice overs are possible too. We think iMovie is one of the best alternatives to Adobe Rush available for Mac.

**3\. For Android - Filmora**

 As Rush is not yet available for the Android platform, users must look for alternatives to Premier Rush if they want to go ahead and start making movies. [Filmora](https://tools.techidaily.com/wondershare/filmora/download/) is a great solution, as powerful as most of the desktop editors you'll come across and with all the features you need to get started.

 Clips can be selected from your own device, or from Facebook or Google, and then added into your project folder to be created into a movie. They can then be arranged into a handy timeline, using simple drag and drop functionality which is easy for even beginners to master. There are even in-built themes which you can try out to turn your home movies into something special.

 For switching between stills or video clips, there are a raft of fun transitions available to make it a more cohesive production. You can adjust colors, brightness, speed and more, as well as adding in subtitles and editing in music. One of the best features of this software is the picture-in-picture function, where you can add another video or still over the main one. It's free and amazing fun, and we think one of the best alternatives to Adobe Rush for Android.

**4\. For iOS - LumaFusion**

[LumaFusion](https://itunes.apple.com/us/app/lumafusion/id1062022008?mt=8) is a powerful multi track video editor which has been built for the mobile marketplace. It's widely used by professional filmmakers and journalists, which is why we've picked it as one of the best alternatives to Premier Rush for iOS users.

![](https://images.wondershare.com/filmora/article-images/adobe-rush-alternatives-lumafusion.jpg)

 It's not the easiest app to get started with, but the creators have made a ton of tutorial videos to help you get to grips with it. Capability wise, it's amazing, with up to three tracks for photos, videos, graphic and titles as well as an additional three audio tracks for narration, music and sound effects.

 Video editing includes a wealth of special effects, from color correction tools to transitions, as well as an audio track mixer which can be adjusted on the fly. Title pages can be created, as well as adapting the speed and ratio of playback. Sharing the finished project can be done via social media, cloud storage, disk storage and more.

### Conclusion

 It's great to see more software like Adobe Rush coming onto the market; however, it's important to realize that, despite the hype, there may still be drawbacks to some of these systems. For us, Adobe Rush was exactly that something for editing videos in a rush. If you're serious about making awesome clips though, investigating some of these alternatives to Adobe Rush.

 Before you shell out the high subscription price for Adobe products, it's worth considering what you really want from your software. Having some goals in mind will allow you to compare the different alternatives to Premier Rush to see where the best value for money lies.

 Windows users will need to be upgraded to the latest version of the operating system, at least version 1709 as a minimum. You'll also need at least 8GB of RAM if you want to avoid the system crashing every time you use it.

 Despite having computers that meet the required spec, numerous users have complained that Adobe Rush is buggy and repeatedly crashes. Some say that the laggy performance makes it almost impossible to use.

 An alternative is to use Rush on your iPhone, but for this you'll need to own at least an iPhone 7, preferably something newer. In testing, we found it to be very slow, even on an iPhone X. If you're an Android user, you'll need to wait to experience the 'Rush', because this software is not available for your handset yet. Adobe have said they are working on it and how to have it ready at some point in 2019.

#### Performance

 As a video editing tool, it's fairly competent, but for anything more than the basics, it's somewhat lacking. Many of the most basic video editing tools are missing, and the platform supports only three transitions, so if you're into making longer or more complex videos, its just not going to work.

 In terms of rendering, we found it incredibly slow in comparison to some of the alternatives to Adobe Rush. The background music choices are pretty limited too, and most of it is not what you want accompanying your cutting-edge videos.

 What really broke the deal for us was the inability to specify the output of your video files. This means that although social sharing could be OK, you're going to be stuck if you want to share it in other locations. It's great to see a video editing app on iPhone, but overall, it's really nothing special.

#### Price

 If you already subscribe to the Adobe Create Cloud (CC) suite, then Rush will be included in your subscription. However, if you want to subscribe to it as a standalone app, the price is $9.99 a month for individuals. This is not particularly competitive with the alternatives to Premier Rush, and could be prohibitively expensive for the hobbyist, which is, after all, the market Adobe are aiming at.

## Alternatives to Adobe Rush for All Platforms

 While Adobe are marketing Rush as a 'cross platform' video editor, there are alternatives to Premier Rush which do the job just as well, if not better, and often for a lot less.

**1\. For Windows - Wondershare Filmora**

 We love [Wondershare Filmora](https://tools.techidaily.com/wondershare/filmora/download/) as an alternative to Adobe Rush for Windows. Unlike Rush, you can pick and choose your video output format, as Filmora is compatible with all major video file types including mp4, FLV, MKV, AVI, MOV and more. Instead of being limited to a handful of basic effects, Filmora supports more than [300 high performance effects](https://effects.wondershare.com/) and filters to perfect your visual appeal.

 Each video can use up to 99 timelines to make it easier to edit and customize your work. Finally, and a big plus for many of us, you don't need to have the latest and best PC in order to use this software. Wondershare Filmora works on Windows 7, 8 and 10, and requires only 3GB of RAM. If you want to work in HD or 4K quality, however, you will need 8GB RAM.

**2\. For Mac - iMovie**

[iMovie](https://www.apple.com/imovie/) is a powerful editing tool designed for iOS and perfect to use on a Mac. Using your own photos and videos, you can create polished movies complete with titles and even a credits roll.

 iMovie lets users access a number of special effects and enhancements, as well as ten filters to improve the images. Music can be chosen from their own library, and narrative voice overs are possible too. We think iMovie is one of the best alternatives to Adobe Rush available for Mac.

**3\. For Android - Filmora**

 As Rush is not yet available for the Android platform, users must look for alternatives to Premier Rush if they want to go ahead and start making movies. [Filmora](https://tools.techidaily.com/wondershare/filmora/download/) is a great solution, as powerful as most of the desktop editors you'll come across and with all the features you need to get started.

 Clips can be selected from your own device, or from Facebook or Google, and then added into your project folder to be created into a movie. They can then be arranged into a handy timeline, using simple drag and drop functionality which is easy for even beginners to master. There are even in-built themes which you can try out to turn your home movies into something special.

 For switching between stills or video clips, there are a raft of fun transitions available to make it a more cohesive production. You can adjust colors, brightness, speed and more, as well as adding in subtitles and editing in music. One of the best features of this software is the picture-in-picture function, where you can add another video or still over the main one. It's free and amazing fun, and we think one of the best alternatives to Adobe Rush for Android.

**4\. For iOS - LumaFusion**

[LumaFusion](https://itunes.apple.com/us/app/lumafusion/id1062022008?mt=8) is a powerful multi track video editor which has been built for the mobile marketplace. It's widely used by professional filmmakers and journalists, which is why we've picked it as one of the best alternatives to Premier Rush for iOS users.

![](https://images.wondershare.com/filmora/article-images/adobe-rush-alternatives-lumafusion.jpg)

 It's not the easiest app to get started with, but the creators have made a ton of tutorial videos to help you get to grips with it. Capability wise, it's amazing, with up to three tracks for photos, videos, graphic and titles as well as an additional three audio tracks for narration, music and sound effects.

 Video editing includes a wealth of special effects, from color correction tools to transitions, as well as an audio track mixer which can be adjusted on the fly. Title pages can be created, as well as adapting the speed and ratio of playback. Sharing the finished project can be done via social media, cloud storage, disk storage and more.

### Conclusion

 It's great to see more software like Adobe Rush coming onto the market; however, it's important to realize that, despite the hype, there may still be drawbacks to some of these systems. For us, Adobe Rush was exactly that something for editing videos in a rush. If you're serious about making awesome clips though, investigating some of these alternatives to Adobe Rush.

 Before you shell out the high subscription price for Adobe products, it's worth considering what you really want from your software. Having some goals in mind will allow you to compare the different alternatives to Premier Rush to see where the best value for money lies.

Aspect ratio is the relationship between the width and the height of the video and it defines how your video will appear on the screen. The right aspect ratio is important to offer a pleasing viewing experience. With multiple social media sites supporting different aspect ratios, the need for changing them accordingly arises quite often.

The marketing, business, and all other activities have taken an online route and with this, the video content on several social media sites for promotion has also increased.

The majority of the video players as well as capturing devices use this aspect ratio as their default settings. The best resolution that can be used with this aspect ratio is 3840 X 2160 pixels.

**●** 1:1- Originally this aspect ratio was used for square TV sets but now it is majorly used for the videos on Instagram and Facebook. A lot of cameras also support this setting.

**●** 9:16- The setting for this aspect ratio has become popular after the increased use of smartphones. Used for the tall videos, the setting can be seen in the videos posted as an Instagram story, Snapchat, and Facebook.

**●** 21:9 – This setting of the aspect ratio is used for cinematic widescreen or videos with the anamorphic format. The use of this aspect ratio is very particular and videos supporting this setting generally can be seen in theme parks, special theatres, and museums.

## Part 2 Difference Between Aspect Ratio and Resolution

Aspect ratio and resolution are interrelated and go hand-in-hand. For a certain aspect ratio, there is several counterparts’ resolution that can be used. While the aspect ratio defines the width and the height relationship, the resolution is the number of pixels on the screen.

To obtain the resolution of a video, you will multiply the height by the width while for the aspect ratio, width is divided by the height. When the height is multiplied by its width times, the results you get represent the square pixels of your screen and this number dented the quality of the video. The higher the pixels, the higher will be the video quality.
