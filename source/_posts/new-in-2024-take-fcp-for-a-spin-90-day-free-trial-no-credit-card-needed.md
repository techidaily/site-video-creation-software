## Part 1: How to get and download Final Cut Pro demo for 90 days?

 As it might be clear by now, Final Cut Pro is a professional video editing software and a product for Apple. Also, Final Cut Pro costs hundreds of dollars [(See details about Final Cut Pro price here)](https://filmora.wondershare.com/final-cut-pro/final-cut-pro-price.html) if you choose to purchase, so the 90-day offer has come in as a massive relief for those who want to try its features for free for more days. People who are already using the earlier Final Cut Pro trial version will be able to use it for another 90 days without paying anything.

* OS requirement: macOS 10.15.6 or later.
* Disc space: 3.8GB minimum. Need more room for FCPX? Click this.

* Graphics card: Metal-capable.

![fcpx-mac-store](https://images.wondershare.com/filmora/images/final-cut-pro/fcpx-mac-store.png)

**What Needs to be done?**

* **Step 1:** First, you need to visit Apple's Final Cut Pro page to download the 90days free trial version. Just make sure that your system meets the basic requirements.
* **Step 2:** You will be asked to enter your first and last name along with your email address. Please fill in all the details. After that, click on the blue tab that says download free trial. The total size will be 2.7GB.

For those who already try out Final Cut Pro and are happy with the editor, you can see how to [save money with the education bundle of Apple.](https://tools.techidaily.com/wondershare/filmora/download/)

And for those who are trying out Final Cut Pro, here is a collection of [FCPX tutorials](https://tools.techidaily.com/wondershare/filmora/download/) for you to get started with!

## Part 2: Why Final Cut Pro trial won't open?

 Although there shouldn't be any issue in downloading the Final Cut Pro trial version, if you meet your system's requirements, some customers are complaining that they can't download or install the Final Cur Pro trial package. Well, if that's happening, there could be a few reasons which are highlighted below.

![fcpx-in-mac](https://images.wondershare.com/filmora/images/final-cut-pro/fcpx-in-mac.jpg)

**Poor Internet Connection**

The most common reason for not being able to download Final Cut Pro 90 days trial version is you have a poor internet connection. You may feel that you have a superb browsing speed, but if your downloading speed is slow, the file may encounter some glitches, eventually ending up with a broken Final Cut Pro Trial file. And once the package is broken, you won't be able to install the installer package. Also, the downloading file is quite huge, and you need to have a proper internet connection. So, before contacting Apple to check whether your internet connection is strong or not.

**Check System Requirements**

To download the Final Cut Pro free trial version, your Mac system has to meet Apple's minimum requirements. Even if one of the requirements fails to meet, you won't be able to download Final Cut Pro 90-days free trial. To try the latest version, the OS has to be 10.15.6 or later. Your system must have 4GB of RAM and a metal-capable graphics card. The disk space should be 3.8GB. Ensure that your system meets the requirement. If the OS is not updated, update it before trying to download the package.

**Try Using Another Account**

Final Cut Pro 90-days free trial is essentially available for new users or those already using the 30days free trial. For those who are already on the 30-days free trial, the free trial package will automatically get extended. But Final Cut Pro already has your account details. Hence, if your previous free trial expired already, you may face some issues when trying to download, launch, or run the latest 90-days free trial offer. So, you can use another account and sign up and then try to download the newest version.

**Quit and Restart your System**

If you have successfully downloaded and installed Final Cut Pro but are unable to launch Final Cut Pro even after refreshing memory, probably, there is a minor glitch on your system. The primary thing to do would be trying to restart your system and then check if you are able to launch it now.

**Disconnect External Devices**

If you are using a malfunctioning or incompatible external device, even then, you may face problems while running Final Cut Pro. To resolve this issue, first shut down your system. Now, apart from the mouse and keyboard, disconnect every other external device that you are using. Next, reset NVRAM and now try to launch Final Cut Pro; it should operate normally now.

## Part 3: How to reset the Final Cut Pro trial before it expires?

 Final Cut Pro free trial version will be over after 90 days because that's their policy. Unfortunately, this means that once the free trial version is over, you will have to buy Final Cut Pro to continue using it. However, there is a way to reset it. But first, you need to check if your Mac has swift library installed. If it is installed and running, go on and enter the code mentioned below in the terminal and then hit enter. After everything is done, the code will be executed, and the rest of the free trial version will be completed.

 ![trial-expire](https://images.wondershare.com/filmora/images/final-cut-pro/trial-expire.jpg)

Code to reset Final Cut Pro 10.4.4

 #!/usr/bin/swift

 import Foundation

 let path = URL(fileURLWithPath: NSString(string: "\~/Library/Application Support/.ffuserdata").expandingTildeInPath)

 let data = try! NSData(contentsOf: path) as Data

 let dictionary = try! NSKeyedUnarchiver.unarchiveTopLevelObjectWithData(data) as! NSDictionary

 let mutableDictionary = dictionary.mutableCopy() as! NSMutableDictionary

 for (key, value) in mutableDictionary {

 if value is NSDate {

 mutableDictionary\[key\] = Date()

 }

 }

 try! NSKeyedArchiver.archivedData(withRootObject: mutableDictionary, requiringSecureCoding: false).write(to: path)

 print("You'd better buy it")

 It's quite complicated that you will have to enter this code manually into the terminal each time the trial expires. Regrettably, there is no way to extend the free trial permanently, so you will have to repeat this part over and over again.

But to be aware, this may lead to a ban or other punishment to your account by Apple Inc.

Anyway, it makes sense why people want to stick to their free trial! Final Cut Pro is not an affordable video editing tool.

If you love fcpx that much but can't afford it, [see how to get fcpx with the cheapest price here.](https://tools.techidaily.com/wondershare/filmora/download/)

Or, you can try other powerful editors with much lower prices, like Filmora.

## Part 4: FAQ

**What is the limitation of the trial version of FCPX?**

Final Cut Pro Additional Content, which includes over 1300 royalty-free sound effects for use in your projects, isn’t available in the Final Cut Pro trial. The trial is fully functional otherwise.

You can import media, edit, organize, add effects, color correct, export files in a variety of professional formats, and more. Get an overview of Final Cut Pro.

**Is Final Cut Pro worth the price?**

Final Cut Pro comes with robust video editing features, which can help you create stunning and professional-level videos. However, Final Cut Pro is not for beginners, and if $299 is a little too expensive for you, it is better to find another video editing tool that won't cost you this much and will let you create professional-looking videos effortlessly. This is when Filmora by Wondershare comes into play.

Code to reset Final Cut Pro 10.4.4

 #!/usr/bin/swift

 import Foundation

 let path = URL(fileURLWithPath: NSString(string: "\~/Library/Application Support/.ffuserdata").expandingTildeInPath)

 let data = try! NSData(contentsOf: path) as Data

 let dictionary = try! NSKeyedUnarchiver.unarchiveTopLevelObjectWithData(data) as! NSDictionary

 let mutableDictionary = dictionary.mutableCopy() as! NSMutableDictionary

 for (key, value) in mutableDictionary {

 if value is NSDate {

 mutableDictionary\[key\] = Date()

 }

 }

 try! NSKeyedArchiver.archivedData(withRootObject: mutableDictionary, requiringSecureCoding: false).write(to: path)

 print("You'd better buy it")

 It's quite complicated that you will have to enter this code manually into the terminal each time the trial expires. Regrettably, there is no way to extend the free trial permanently, so you will have to repeat this part over and over again.

But to be aware, this may lead to a ban or other punishment to your account by Apple Inc.

Anyway, it makes sense why people want to stick to their free trial! Final Cut Pro is not an affordable video editing tool.

## Part 4: FAQ

**What is the limitation of the trial version of FCPX?**

Final Cut Pro Additional Content, which includes over 1300 royalty-free sound effects for use in your projects, isn’t available in the Final Cut Pro trial. The trial is fully functional otherwise.

You can import media, edit, organize, add effects, color correct, export files in a variety of professional formats, and more. Get an overview of Final Cut Pro.

**Is Final Cut Pro worth the price?**

Final Cut Pro comes with robust video editing features, which can help you create stunning and professional-level videos. However, Final Cut Pro is not for beginners, and if $299 is a little too expensive for you, it is better to find another video editing tool that won't cost you this much and will let you create professional-looking videos effortlessly. This is when Filmora by Wondershare comes into play.

## Part 2: Why Final Cut Pro trial won't open?

 Although there shouldn't be any issue in downloading the Final Cut Pro trial version, if you meet your system's requirements, some customers are complaining that they can't download or install the Final Cur Pro trial package. Well, if that's happening, there could be a few reasons which are highlighted below.

![fcpx-in-mac](https://images.wondershare.com/filmora/images/final-cut-pro/fcpx-in-mac.jpg)

**Poor Internet Connection**

The most common reason for not being able to download Final Cut Pro 90 days trial version is you have a poor internet connection. You may feel that you have a superb browsing speed, but if your downloading speed is slow, the file may encounter some glitches, eventually ending up with a broken Final Cut Pro Trial file. And once the package is broken, you won't be able to install the installer package. Also, the downloading file is quite huge, and you need to have a proper internet connection. So, before contacting Apple to check whether your internet connection is strong or not.

**Check System Requirements**

To download the Final Cut Pro free trial version, your Mac system has to meet Apple's minimum requirements. Even if one of the requirements fails to meet, you won't be able to download Final Cut Pro 90-days free trial. To try the latest version, the OS has to be 10.15.6 or later. Your system must have 4GB of RAM and a metal-capable graphics card. The disk space should be 3.8GB. Ensure that your system meets the requirement. If the OS is not updated, update it before trying to download the package.

**Try Using Another Account**

Final Cut Pro 90-days free trial is essentially available for new users or those already using the 30days free trial. For those who are already on the 30-days free trial, the free trial package will automatically get extended. But Final Cut Pro already has your account details. Hence, if your previous free trial expired already, you may face some issues when trying to download, launch, or run the latest 90-days free trial offer. So, you can use another account and sign up and then try to download the newest version.

**Quit and Restart your System**

If you have successfully downloaded and installed Final Cut Pro but are unable to launch Final Cut Pro even after refreshing memory, probably, there is a minor glitch on your system. The primary thing to do would be trying to restart your system and then check if you are able to launch it now.

**Disconnect External Devices**

If you are using a malfunctioning or incompatible external device, even then, you may face problems while running Final Cut Pro. To resolve this issue, first shut down your system. Now, apart from the mouse and keyboard, disconnect every other external device that you are using. Next, reset NVRAM and now try to launch Final Cut Pro; it should operate normally now.

## Part 3: How to reset the Final Cut Pro trial before it expires?

 Final Cut Pro free trial version will be over after 90 days because that's their policy. Unfortunately, this means that once the free trial version is over, you will have to buy Final Cut Pro to continue using it. However, there is a way to reset it. But first, you need to check if your Mac has swift library installed. If it is installed and running, go on and enter the code mentioned below in the terminal and then hit enter. After everything is done, the code will be executed, and the rest of the free trial version will be completed.

VideoPad Video Editor is compatible with both Mac and Windows computers and supports a number of video import and export options. This nch video editor comes with a free basic plan where you don't have to pay anything, so you can try to see how it works. In this article, we will do a quick review of this video editing software so that you have a better understanding of its features.

## **Features of VideoPad**

* Any camera can be used to create videos

### **Ease of use and interface**

With VideoPad's easy-to-use interface and well-organized conventions, movie makers of any skill level can become familiar with its basics in no time at all. You will become fluent in no time at all in opening and closing windows, stringing clips together, and adding narration, transitions, and text to create a powerful visual presentation. Adding video, audio, and still, photo assets to the files pane will put them on the timeline and allow you to assemble your story.

Videos and still images are organized into bins by the app, ensuring they don't get confused on the timeline, which speeds up the workflow, especially for newcomers.

The app uses menus and can be dragged and dropped, so a single objective can be accomplished in different ways. You can control all functions from within the application frame, or dockable panels can be used to get a closer look at what needs to be done. A permanent reorganization of the workspace would be appreciated.

### **Videopad Video Editing Features**

VideoPad is the perfect balance between too much and not enough. Although there are not many options, it offers a reasonable selection of transitions for moving between clips and images, as well as a selection of filters to give them a unique look. In addition to editing 360-degree video, video stabilization is another helpful feature.

Each filter can be previewed with a click before applying it, and You can combine several to create a custom effect or template for reuse. You can also adjust their length via menus.

A video can be enhanced with transitions, visual effects, overlays, and text using VideoPad. Also included are some basic audio tools and a library of sound effects and atmospheric background music. There are a number of features that allow you to optimize videos, including color correction, adding digital images, adding subtitles, and adjusting the speed of playback. With its video stabilization feature, you can reduce camera shake, and the high-end version supports special effect plugins, but only for Windows.

### **Videopad Audio Editing Features**

VideoPad offers a limited set of audio tools, but it does allow you to mix multiple audio tracks, music, and narration to create a movie soundtrack. A video clip's audio can be faded, mixed, and adjusted for volume, but if you want to go further, you'll need an external mixer or editor. From VideoPad's main menu, you can download NCH's own WavePad.

While the text-to-speech features always sounded false, you can record narration directly within the program. There is a great idea in having voice recognition for subtitles, which is only available on the Windows version. However, the implementation falls short of expectations. Although the video was clearly spoken in a quiet environment, it automatically failed to translate into subtitles.

### **Videopad Content Sharing features**

Video creators who publish to YouTube or other social media platforms can use the software because it allows them to share videos directly to platforms such as Dropbox, Flickr, Google Drive, and Vimeo. To avoid unnecessary data sharing, you can save videos to your desktop and upload them yourself.

### **Is VideoPad worth buying?**

Although the VideoPad video editor free version is somewhat limited, it functions as a free trial to see if you like it enough to upgrade. Apps that are easy to use and have a simple interface can help convert a free user to a paying customer, and VideoPad has a strong claim to your money thanks to its simplicity and light hardware requirements.

## **Our Recommendation**

As a beginner, you may be looking to use Videopad free, but when it comes to features, it just falls short compared to modern video editors. So, we recommend you use our Filmora X video editor. Filmora video editor is free to download, so you can try out all the features without paying a penny. However free version will have a watermark when you export the video. You will have to purchase a subscription to get rid of the watermark. If you compare the features and user-friendliness of both these video editors, then Filmora definitely stands out by all means. In addition to its feature richness, it also has a user-friendly interface that beginners can easily adapt to. So, don't waste your time and give it a try right now.

![av video cutters](https://images.wondershare.com/filmora/article-images/2022/07/avi-video-cutters-1.jpg)

Run the setup and let it finish without any pause or break.

**Step 2: Import Your Video to Filmora Video Editor**

Importing your AVI video is a very simple process. Just click on the “Film Clip” icon.

![av video cutters](https://images.wondershare.com/filmora/article-images/2022/07/avi-video-cutters-2.jpg)

It will open a new window screen on your computer to select the video from the directory. Find the clip you want to import and cut. Use your mouse to select it and click the “Open” button.

![av video cutters](https://images.wondershare.com/filmora/article-images/2022/07/avi-video-cutters-3.jpg)

The video will be loaded in the “Media” folder of Filmora. The clip's thumbnail should be visible to assure you have done everything correctly.

![av video cutters](https://images.wondershare.com/filmora/article-images/2022/07/avi-video-cutters-4.jpg)

If you can see that, let’s go to the next step.

**Step 3: Drag and Drop Video to Filmora’s Timeline**

Select the video in the media folder by clicking over it once. Now, without leaving the hold of the left button of your mouse, slide the video down to the track in the timeline.

![av video cutters](https://images.wondershare.com/filmora/article-images/2022/07/avi-video-cutters-5.jpg)

After that, a message will pop up, asking about your preference for the project settings. It is recommended to choose the “Match to Media” option unless you’re an experienced video editor who knows how to play with the resolution and frame rates.

![av video cutters](https://images.wondershare.com/filmora/article-images/2022/07/avi-video-cutters-6.jpg)

You will see the video on the timeline with its preview on the “Preview Screen” on the right side of the interface.

![av video cutters](https://images.wondershare.com/filmora/article-images/2022/07/avi-video-cutters-7.jpg)

**Step 4: Cutting Your Video in Filmora**

Here comes the core step you have been waiting for. But before you go any further, you need to know about the “Playhead.”

Playhead is an orange-reddish marker you can find on the timeline.

![av video cutters](https://images.wondershare.com/filmora/article-images/2022/07/avi-video-cutters-8.jpg)

It has an important role in cutting your videos.

So, move the playhead to your desired frame and click on the “scissor” icon to make the “starting” cut.

![av video cutters](https://images.wondershare.com/filmora/article-images/2022/07/avi-video-cutters-9.jpg)

As soon as you do it, you will see that the single clip is now divided into two parts similar to this image.

![av video cutters](https://images.wondershare.com/filmora/article-images/2022/07/avi-video-cutters-10.jpg)

The “Red” marked area in the above screenshot ensures a gap between the clips on the timeline. The “Yellow” arrows confirm two separate clips of the same video.

Place the two clips together as seen in this “Green” area.

![av video cutters](https://images.wondershare.com/filmora/article-images/2022/07/avi-video-cutters-11.jpg)

And place the playhead anywhere on the clip. And click on the “scissor” icon once again to make the “ending” cut (second cut).

![av video cutters](https://images.wondershare.com/filmora/article-images/2022/07/avi-video-cutters-12.jpg)

![av video cutters](https://images.wondershare.com/filmora/article-images/2022/07/avi-video-cutters-13.jpg)

If done correctly, there should be three clips now of the same video, as you can observe in this screenshot.

![av video cutters](https://images.wondershare.com/filmora/article-images/2022/07/avi-video-cutters-14.jpg)

Again, the “Red” area in the above photo indicates the gap, and the “Yellow” area ensures a third segment of the video.

**_Note_**_: The gaps you can see in the divided clips are made intentionally for understanding. Practically, Filmora doesn’t move the clip or make gaps in between after you have made the cuts._

Keep in mind that there are three clips on the timeline. Now, if you want to remove the second clip from the video, you need to select that portion first by clicking on it.

![av video cutters](https://images.wondershare.com/filmora/article-images/2022/07/avi-video-cutters-15.jpg)

Then, right-click on the mouse and choose “Cut” from the menu.

![av video cutters](https://images.wondershare.com/filmora/article-images/2022/07/avi-video-cutters-16.jpg)

Within a semi-second, the selected portion will be removed from the timeline. And you will be able to see the remaining parts of the video. Now, pull the second clip using your mouse and place it at the end of the first clip without leaving a gap in between.

Then, click the “Play” button under the preview screen to see the results.

![av video cutters](https://images.wondershare.com/filmora/article-images/2022/07/avi-video-cutters-17.jpg)

![av video cutters](https://images.wondershare.com/filmora/article-images/2022/07/avi-video-cutters-18.jpg)

You can see in the above two screenshots that there’s a jump between the scenes due to cuts, confirming that video has been cut significantly.

**Step 5: Trimming Your Video in Filmora**

Remember that cutting and trimming in Filmora are two different things. Trimming allows you to remove a particular video part from visibility without deleting the portion.

So feel free to skip this step if you’re happy learning the cutting technique. But if you’re interested in trimming, here’s how you do it.

Take your mouse cursor at the beginning or end of the clip you want to trim. Keep holding the clip’s corner and slide the mouse back or front to trim the part

![av video cutters](https://images.wondershare.com/filmora/article-images/2022/07/avi-video-cutters-19.jpg)

**_Note:_** _Since the trim tool doesn’t delete the video, the final project based on trimming will be of a larger size. Therefore, it is advised to cut videos rather than trimming for fast rendering, better results, and small video size._

**Step 6: Save Project and Export Your Cut/Trimmed AVI Video**

Choose “Save Project” from the “File” menu.

![av video cutters](https://images.wondershare.com/filmora/article-images/2022/07/avi-video-cutters-20.jpg)

Select the directory to save the project, rename the new video, and click the “Save” button.

![av video cutters](https://images.wondershare.com/filmora/article-images/2022/07/avi-video-cutters-21.jpg)

Click on the “Export” button to save the video in AVI or any other video format of your choice on your computer.

![av video cutters](https://images.wondershare.com/filmora/article-images/2022/07/avi-video-cutters-22.jpg)

## Part 2: Top 3 Free AVI Video Cutter on Windows

As a Windows user, finding an excellent video cutter is relatively easy. However, not all software permits importing AVI videos. In the same way, some video trimmers come at a price. So if you really don’t want to pay and enjoy cutting your AVI files, try using these three video cutting tools.

### Microsoft Photos (Windows 10)

![av video cutters](https://images.wondershare.com/filmora/article-images/2022/07/avi-video-cutters-23.jpg)

[Microsoft Photos](https://apps.microsoft.com/store/detail/microsoft-photos/9WZDNCRFJBH4?hl=en-pk&gl=PK) or Photo App is a free photo viewer and editor with your Windows 10\. It offers incredible photo editing and enhancement along with different tools for organizing and editing videos in a very friendly way. Likewise, you can create drawings over the videos and add 3D effects and background music to your clips.

You can also trim AVI videos with Microsoft Photos quickly. All you need to do is open your clip with the Photo App, choose the “Trim” option, select a portion of the video you want to trim, and go ahead.

That’s it!

**Features**

* Quick video trimming

* 3D library and effects
* It has a clear interface

### Handbrake

![av video cutters](https://images.wondershare.com/filmora/article-images/2022/07/avi-video-cutters-24.jpg)

[Handbrake](https://handbrake.fr/downloads.php) is best-known for its video transcoding traits. Unlike typical video editors, this open-source tool includes limited options to rip Blu-rays and DVDs. Moreover, you can mix the 5.1 soundtracks and convert them to stereo to make the audio compatible with your TV speakers.

But the exciting thing about Handbrake is that you can use this software on your macOS 10.13 or later versions to cut AVI videos for free. However, it’s a bit technical process, as there’s no timeline to help you trim or make cuts on the clips directly with the help of your mouse.

You are required to mention a time range (seconds, minutes, or hours) to keep a specific part of the video while the software removes the non-ranged parts of the clip. For instance, you have a video of 10 seconds. You start the range from 5 seconds and end it at 10 seconds. So, the first four seconds of the video will be cut from the entire clip.

**Features**

* Video cutting, cropping, and resizing
* Low-quality and old video restoration
* Video conversion from any format to MKV or MP4

**Pros**

* Handbrake is free
* You can convert batch videos with ease
* It supports MAC, Windows, and Linux OS
* Allows you to import video files in all major formats
* The software comes with various video conversion presets

* The video file output is limited to two formats (MKV and MP4) only

![av video cutters](https://images.wondershare.com/filmora/article-images/2022/07/avi-video-cutters-1.jpg)

Run the setup and let it finish without any pause or break.

**Step 2: Import Your Video to Filmora Video Editor**

Importing your AVI video is a very simple process. Just click on the “Film Clip” icon.

![av video cutters](https://images.wondershare.com/filmora/article-images/2022/07/avi-video-cutters-2.jpg)

It will open a new window screen on your computer to select the video from the directory. Find the clip you want to import and cut. Use your mouse to select it and click the “Open” button.

![av video cutters](https://images.wondershare.com/filmora/article-images/2022/07/avi-video-cutters-3.jpg)

The video will be loaded in the “Media” folder of Filmora. The clip's thumbnail should be visible to assure you have done everything correctly.

![av video cutters](https://images.wondershare.com/filmora/article-images/2022/07/avi-video-cutters-4.jpg)

If you can see that, let’s go to the next step.

**Step 3: Drag and Drop Video to Filmora’s Timeline**

Select the video in the media folder by clicking over it once. Now, without leaving the hold of the left button of your mouse, slide the video down to the track in the timeline.

![av video cutters](https://images.wondershare.com/filmora/article-images/2022/07/avi-video-cutters-5.jpg)

After that, a message will pop up, asking about your preference for the project settings. It is recommended to choose the “Match to Media” option unless you’re an experienced video editor who knows how to play with the resolution and frame rates.

![av video cutters](https://images.wondershare.com/filmora/article-images/2022/07/avi-video-cutters-6.jpg)

You will see the video on the timeline with its preview on the “Preview Screen” on the right side of the interface.

![av video cutters](https://images.wondershare.com/filmora/article-images/2022/07/avi-video-cutters-7.jpg)

**Step 4: Cutting Your Video in Filmora**

Here comes the core step you have been waiting for. But before you go any further, you need to know about the “Playhead.”

Playhead is an orange-reddish marker you can find on the timeline.

![av video cutters](https://images.wondershare.com/filmora/article-images/2022/07/avi-video-cutters-8.jpg)

It has an important role in cutting your videos.

So, move the playhead to your desired frame and click on the “scissor” icon to make the “starting” cut.

![av video cutters](https://images.wondershare.com/filmora/article-images/2022/07/avi-video-cutters-9.jpg)

As soon as you do it, you will see that the single clip is now divided into two parts similar to this image.

![av video cutters](https://images.wondershare.com/filmora/article-images/2022/07/avi-video-cutters-10.jpg)

The “Red” marked area in the above screenshot ensures a gap between the clips on the timeline. The “Yellow” arrows confirm two separate clips of the same video.

Place the two clips together as seen in this “Green” area.

![av video cutters](https://images.wondershare.com/filmora/article-images/2022/07/avi-video-cutters-11.jpg)

And place the playhead anywhere on the clip. And click on the “scissor” icon once again to make the “ending” cut (second cut).

![av video cutters](https://images.wondershare.com/filmora/article-images/2022/07/avi-video-cutters-12.jpg)

![av video cutters](https://images.wondershare.com/filmora/article-images/2022/07/avi-video-cutters-13.jpg)

If done correctly, there should be three clips now of the same video, as you can observe in this screenshot.

![av video cutters](https://images.wondershare.com/filmora/article-images/2022/07/avi-video-cutters-14.jpg)

Again, the “Red” area in the above photo indicates the gap, and the “Yellow” area ensures a third segment of the video.

**_Note_**_: The gaps you can see in the divided clips are made intentionally for understanding. Practically, Filmora doesn’t move the clip or make gaps in between after you have made the cuts._

Keep in mind that there are three clips on the timeline. Now, if you want to remove the second clip from the video, you need to select that portion first by clicking on it.

![av video cutters](https://images.wondershare.com/filmora/article-images/2022/07/avi-video-cutters-15.jpg)

Then, right-click on the mouse and choose “Cut” from the menu.

![av video cutters](https://images.wondershare.com/filmora/article-images/2022/07/avi-video-cutters-16.jpg)

Within a semi-second, the selected portion will be removed from the timeline. And you will be able to see the remaining parts of the video. Now, pull the second clip using your mouse and place it at the end of the first clip without leaving a gap in between.

Then, click the “Play” button under the preview screen to see the results.

![av video cutters](https://images.wondershare.com/filmora/article-images/2022/07/avi-video-cutters-17.jpg)

![av video cutters](https://images.wondershare.com/filmora/article-images/2022/07/avi-video-cutters-18.jpg)

You can see in the above two screenshots that there’s a jump between the scenes due to cuts, confirming that video has been cut significantly.

**Step 5: Trimming Your Video in Filmora**

Remember that cutting and trimming in Filmora are two different things. Trimming allows you to remove a particular video part from visibility without deleting the portion.

So feel free to skip this step if you’re happy learning the cutting technique. But if you’re interested in trimming, here’s how you do it.

Take your mouse cursor at the beginning or end of the clip you want to trim. Keep holding the clip’s corner and slide the mouse back or front to trim the part

![av video cutters](https://images.wondershare.com/filmora/article-images/2022/07/avi-video-cutters-19.jpg)

**_Note:_** _Since the trim tool doesn’t delete the video, the final project based on trimming will be of a larger size. Therefore, it is advised to cut videos rather than trimming for fast rendering, better results, and small video size._

**Step 6: Save Project and Export Your Cut/Trimmed AVI Video**

Choose “Save Project” from the “File” menu.

![av video cutters](https://images.wondershare.com/filmora/article-images/2022/07/avi-video-cutters-20.jpg)

Select the directory to save the project, rename the new video, and click the “Save” button.

![av video cutters](https://images.wondershare.com/filmora/article-images/2022/07/avi-video-cutters-21.jpg)

Click on the “Export” button to save the video in AVI or any other video format of your choice on your computer.

## Part 2: Top 3 Free AVI Video Cutter on Windows

As a Windows user, finding an excellent video cutter is relatively easy. However, not all software permits importing AVI videos. In the same way, some video trimmers come at a price. So if you really don’t want to pay and enjoy cutting your AVI files, try using these three video cutting tools.

### Microsoft Photos (Windows 10)

![av video cutters](https://images.wondershare.com/filmora/article-images/2022/07/avi-video-cutters-23.jpg)

It offers incredible photo editing and enhancement along with different tools for organizing and editing videos in a very friendly way. Likewise, you can create drawings over the videos and add 3D effects and background music to your clips.

You can also trim AVI videos with Microsoft Photos quickly. All you need to do is open your clip with the Photo App, choose the “Trim” option, select a portion of the video you want to trim, and go ahead.

That’s it!

Moreover, you can mix the 5.1 soundtracks and convert them to stereo to make the audio compatible with your TV speakers.

But the exciting thing about Handbrake is that you can use this software on your macOS 10.13 or later versions to cut AVI videos for free. However, it’s a bit technical process, as there’s no timeline to help you trim or make cuts on the clips directly with the help of your mouse.

You are required to mention a time range (seconds, minutes, or hours) to keep a specific part of the video while the software removes the non-ranged parts of the clip. For instance, you have a video of 10 seconds. You start the range from 5 seconds and end it at 10 seconds. So, the first four seconds of the video will be cut from the entire clip.

**Features**

* Video cutting, cropping, and resizing
* Low-quality and old video restoration
* Video conversion from any format to MKV or MP4

**Pros**

* Handbrake is free

**Features**

![av video cutters](https://images.wondershare.com/filmora/article-images/2022/07/avi-video-cutters-1.jpg)

Run the setup and let it finish without any pause or break.

**Step 2: Import Your Video to Filmora Video Editor**

Importing your AVI video is a very simple process. Just click on the “Film Clip” icon.

![av video cutters](https://images.wondershare.com/filmora/article-images/2022/07/avi-video-cutters-2.jpg)

It will open a new window screen on your computer to select the video from the directory. Find the clip you want to import and cut. Use your mouse to select it and click the “Open” button.

![av video cutters](https://images.wondershare.com/filmora/article-images/2022/07/avi-video-cutters-3.jpg)

The video will be loaded in the “Media” folder of Filmora. The clip's thumbnail should be visible to assure you have done everything correctly.

![av video cutters](https://images.wondershare.com/filmora/article-images/2022/07/avi-video-cutters-4.jpg)

If you can see that, let’s go to the next step.

**Step 3: Drag and Drop Video to Filmora’s Timeline**

Select the video in the media folder by clicking over it once. Now, without leaving the hold of the left button of your mouse, slide the video down to the track in the timeline.

![av video cutters](https://images.wondershare.com/filmora/article-images/2022/07/avi-video-cutters-5.jpg)

After that, a message will pop up, asking about your preference for the project settings. It is recommended to choose the “Match to Media” option unless you’re an experienced video editor who knows how to play with the resolution and frame rates.

![av video cutters](https://images.wondershare.com/filmora/article-images/2022/07/avi-video-cutters-6.jpg)

You will see the video on the timeline with its preview on the “Preview Screen” on the right side of the interface.

![av video cutters](https://images.wondershare.com/filmora/article-images/2022/07/avi-video-cutters-7.jpg)

**Step 4: Cutting Your Video in Filmora**

Here comes the core step you have been waiting for. But before you go any further, you need to know about the “Playhead.”

Playhead is an orange-reddish marker you can find on the timeline.

![av video cutters](https://images.wondershare.com/filmora/article-images/2022/07/avi-video-cutters-8.jpg)

It has an important role in cutting your videos.

So, move the playhead to your desired frame and click on the “scissor” icon to make the “starting” cut.

![av video cutters](https://images.wondershare.com/filmora/article-images/2022/07/avi-video-cutters-9.jpg)

As soon as you do it, you will see that the single clip is now divided into two parts similar to this image.

![av video cutters](https://images.wondershare.com/filmora/article-images/2022/07/avi-video-cutters-10.jpg)

The “Red” marked area in the above screenshot ensures a gap between the clips on the timeline. The “Yellow” arrows confirm two separate clips of the same video.

Place the two clips together as seen in this “Green” area.

![av video cutters](https://images.wondershare.com/filmora/article-images/2022/07/avi-video-cutters-11.jpg)

And place the playhead anywhere on the clip. And click on the “scissor” icon once again to make the “ending” cut (second cut).

![av video cutters](https://images.wondershare.com/filmora/article-images/2022/07/avi-video-cutters-12.jpg)

![av video cutters](https://images.wondershare.com/filmora/article-images/2022/07/avi-video-cutters-13.jpg)

If done correctly, there should be three clips now of the same video, as you can observe in this screenshot.

![av video cutters](https://images.wondershare.com/filmora/article-images/2022/07/avi-video-cutters-14.jpg)

Again, the “Red” area in the above photo indicates the gap, and the “Yellow” area ensures a third segment of the video.

**_Note_**_: The gaps you can see in the divided clips are made intentionally for understanding. Practically, Filmora doesn’t move the clip or make gaps in between after you have made the cuts._

Keep in mind that there are three clips on the timeline. Now, if you want to remove the second clip from the video, you need to select that portion first by clicking on it.

![av video cutters](https://images.wondershare.com/filmora/article-images/2022/07/avi-video-cutters-15.jpg)

Then, right-click on the mouse and choose “Cut” from the menu.

![av video cutters](https://images.wondershare.com/filmora/article-images/2022/07/avi-video-cutters-16.jpg)

Within a semi-second, the selected portion will be removed from the timeline. And you will be able to see the remaining parts of the video. Now, pull the second clip using your mouse and place it at the end of the first clip without leaving a gap in between.

Then, click the “Play” button under the preview screen to see the results.

![av video cutters](https://images.wondershare.com/filmora/article-images/2022/07/avi-video-cutters-17.jpg)

![av video cutters](https://images.wondershare.com/filmora/article-images/2022/07/avi-video-cutters-18.jpg)

You can see in the above two screenshots that there’s a jump between the scenes due to cuts, confirming that video has been cut significantly.

**Step 5: Trimming Your Video in Filmora**

Remember that cutting and trimming in Filmora are two different things. Trimming allows you to remove a particular video part from visibility without deleting the portion.

So feel free to skip this step if you’re happy learning the cutting technique. But if you’re interested in trimming, here’s how you do it.

Take your mouse cursor at the beginning or end of the clip you want to trim. Keep holding the clip’s corner and slide the mouse back or front to trim the part

![av video cutters](https://images.wondershare.com/filmora/article-images/2022/07/avi-video-cutters-19.jpg)

**_Note:_** _Since the trim tool doesn’t delete the video, the final project based on trimming will be of a larger size. Therefore, it is advised to cut videos rather than trimming for fast rendering, better results, and small video size._

**Step 6: Save Project and Export Your Cut/Trimmed AVI Video**

Choose “Save Project” from the “File” menu.

![av video cutters](https://images.wondershare.com/filmora/article-images/2022/07/avi-video-cutters-20.jpg)

Select the directory to save the project, rename the new video, and click the “Save” button.

![av video cutters](https://images.wondershare.com/filmora/article-images/2022/07/avi-video-cutters-21.jpg)

Click on the “Export” button to save the video in AVI or any other video format of your choice on your computer.

## Part 2: Top 3 Free AVI Video Cutter on Windows

As a Windows user, finding an excellent video cutter is relatively easy. However, not all software permits importing AVI videos. In the same way, some video trimmers come at a price. So if you really don’t want to pay and enjoy cutting your AVI files, try using these three video cutting tools.

### Microsoft Photos (Windows 10)

![av video cutters](https://images.wondershare.com/filmora/article-images/2022/07/avi-video-cutters-23.jpg)

It offers incredible photo editing and enhancement along with different tools for organizing and editing videos in a very friendly way. Likewise, you can create drawings over the videos and add 3D effects and background music to your clips.

You can also trim AVI videos with Microsoft Photos quickly. All you need to do is open your clip with the Photo App, choose the “Trim” option, select a portion of the video you want to trim, and go ahead.

That’s it!

Moreover, you can mix the 5.1 soundtracks and convert them to stereo to make the audio compatible with your TV speakers.

But the exciting thing about Handbrake is that you can use this software on your macOS 10.13 or later versions to cut AVI videos for free. However, it’s a bit technical process, as there’s no timeline to help you trim or make cuts on the clips directly with the help of your mouse.

You are required to mention a time range (seconds, minutes, or hours) to keep a specific part of the video while the software removes the non-ranged parts of the clip. For instance, you have a video of 10 seconds. You start the range from 5 seconds and end it at 10 seconds. So, the first four seconds of the video will be cut from the entire clip.

**Features**

* Video cutting, cropping, and resizing
* Low-quality and old video restoration
* Video conversion from any format to MKV or MP4

**Pros**

* Handbrake is free

**Features**

![av video cutters](https://images.wondershare.com/filmora/article-images/2022/07/avi-video-cutters-1.jpg)

Run the setup and let it finish without any pause or break.

**Step 2: Import Your Video to Filmora Video Editor**

Importing your AVI video is a very simple process. Just click on the “Film Clip” icon.

![av video cutters](https://images.wondershare.com/filmora/article-images/2022/07/avi-video-cutters-2.jpg)

It will open a new window screen on your computer to select the video from the directory. Find the clip you want to import and cut. Use your mouse to select it and click the “Open” button.

![av video cutters](https://images.wondershare.com/filmora/article-images/2022/07/avi-video-cutters-3.jpg)

The video will be loaded in the “Media” folder of Filmora. The clip's thumbnail should be visible to assure you have done everything correctly.

![av video cutters](https://images.wondershare.com/filmora/article-images/2022/07/avi-video-cutters-4.jpg)

If you can see that, let’s go to the next step.

**Step 3: Drag and Drop Video to Filmora’s Timeline**

Select the video in the media folder by clicking over it once. Now, without leaving the hold of the left button of your mouse, slide the video down to the track in the timeline.

![av video cutters](https://images.wondershare.com/filmora/article-images/2022/07/avi-video-cutters-5.jpg)

After that, a message will pop up, asking about your preference for the project settings. It is recommended to choose the “Match to Media” option unless you’re an experienced video editor who knows how to play with the resolution and frame rates.

![av video cutters](https://images.wondershare.com/filmora/article-images/2022/07/avi-video-cutters-6.jpg)

You will see the video on the timeline with its preview on the “Preview Screen” on the right side of the interface.

![av video cutters](https://images.wondershare.com/filmora/article-images/2022/07/avi-video-cutters-7.jpg)

**Step 4: Cutting Your Video in Filmora**

Here comes the core step you have been waiting for. But before you go any further, you need to know about the “Playhead.”

Playhead is an orange-reddish marker you can find on the timeline.

![av video cutters](https://images.wondershare.com/filmora/article-images/2022/07/avi-video-cutters-8.jpg)

It has an important role in cutting your videos.

So, move the playhead to your desired frame and click on the “scissor” icon to make the “starting” cut.

![av video cutters](https://images.wondershare.com/filmora/article-images/2022/07/avi-video-cutters-9.jpg)

As soon as you do it, you will see that the single clip is now divided into two parts similar to this image.

![av video cutters](https://images.wondershare.com/filmora/article-images/2022/07/avi-video-cutters-10.jpg)

The “Red” marked area in the above screenshot ensures a gap between the clips on the timeline. The “Yellow” arrows confirm two separate clips of the same video.

Place the two clips together as seen in this “Green” area.

![av video cutters](https://images.wondershare.com/filmora/article-images/2022/07/avi-video-cutters-11.jpg)

And place the playhead anywhere on the clip. And click on the “scissor” icon once again to make the “ending” cut (second cut).

![av video cutters](https://images.wondershare.com/filmora/article-images/2022/07/avi-video-cutters-12.jpg)

![av video cutters](https://images.wondershare.com/filmora/article-images/2022/07/avi-video-cutters-13.jpg)

If done correctly, there should be three clips now of the same video, as you can observe in this screenshot.

![av video cutters](https://images.wondershare.com/filmora/article-images/2022/07/avi-video-cutters-14.jpg)

Again, the “Red” area in the above photo indicates the gap, and the “Yellow” area ensures a third segment of the video.

**_Note_**_: The gaps you can see in the divided clips are made intentionally for understanding. Practically, Filmora doesn’t move the clip or make gaps in between after you have made the cuts._

Keep in mind that there are three clips on the timeline. Now, if you want to remove the second clip from the video, you need to select that portion first by clicking on it.

![av video cutters](https://images.wondershare.com/filmora/article-images/2022/07/avi-video-cutters-15.jpg)

Then, right-click on the mouse and choose “Cut” from the menu.

![av video cutters](https://images.wondershare.com/filmora/article-images/2022/07/avi-video-cutters-16.jpg)

Within a semi-second, the selected portion will be removed from the timeline. And you will be able to see the remaining parts of the video. Now, pull the second clip using your mouse and place it at the end of the first clip without leaving a gap in between.

Then, click the “Play” button under the preview screen to see the results.

![av video cutters](https://images.wondershare.com/filmora/article-images/2022/07/avi-video-cutters-17.jpg)

![av video cutters](https://images.wondershare.com/filmora/article-images/2022/07/avi-video-cutters-18.jpg)

You can see in the above two screenshots that there’s a jump between the scenes due to cuts, confirming that video has been cut significantly.

**Step 5: Trimming Your Video in Filmora**

Remember that cutting and trimming in Filmora are two different things. Trimming allows you to remove a particular video part from visibility without deleting the portion.

So feel free to skip this step if you’re happy learning the cutting technique. But if you’re interested in trimming, here’s how you do it.

Take your mouse cursor at the beginning or end of the clip you want to trim. Keep holding the clip’s corner and slide the mouse back or front to trim the part

![av video cutters](https://images.wondershare.com/filmora/article-images/2022/07/avi-video-cutters-19.jpg)

**_Note:_** _Since the trim tool doesn’t delete the video, the final project based on trimming will be of a larger size. Therefore, it is advised to cut videos rather than trimming for fast rendering, better results, and small video size._

**Step 6: Save Project and Export Your Cut/Trimmed AVI Video**

Choose “Save Project” from the “File” menu.

![av video cutters](https://images.wondershare.com/filmora/article-images/2022/07/avi-video-cutters-20.jpg)

Select the directory to save the project, rename the new video, and click the “Save” button.

![av video cutters](https://images.wondershare.com/filmora/article-images/2022/07/avi-video-cutters-21.jpg)

Click on the “Export” button to save the video in AVI or any other video format of your choice on your computer.

## Part 2: Top 3 Free AVI Video Cutter on Windows

As a Windows user, finding an excellent video cutter is relatively easy. However, not all software permits importing AVI videos. In the same way, some video trimmers come at a price. So if you really don’t want to pay and enjoy cutting your AVI files, try using these three video cutting tools.

### Microsoft Photos (Windows 10)

![av video cutters](https://images.wondershare.com/filmora/article-images/2022/07/avi-video-cutters-23.jpg)

[Microsoft Photos](https://apps.microsoft.com/store/detail/microsoft-photos/9WZDNCRFJBH4?hl=en-pk&gl=PK) or Photo App is a free photo viewer and editor with your Windows 10\. It offers incredible photo editing and enhancement along with different tools for organizing and editing videos in a very friendly way. Likewise, you can create drawings over the videos and add 3D effects and background music to your clips.

You can also trim AVI videos with Microsoft Photos quickly. All you need to do is open your clip with the Photo App, choose the “Trim” option, select a portion of the video you want to trim, and go ahead.

That’s it!

**Features**

![av video cutters](https://images.wondershare.com/filmora/article-images/2022/07/avi-video-cutters-24.jpg)

Moreover, you can mix the 5.1 soundtracks and convert them to stereo to make the audio compatible with your TV speakers.

But the exciting thing about Handbrake is that you can use this software on your macOS 10.13 or later versions to cut AVI videos for free. However, it’s a bit technical process, as there’s no timeline to help you trim or make cuts on the clips directly with the help of your mouse.

You are required to mention a time range (seconds, minutes, or hours) to keep a specific part of the video while the software removes the non-ranged parts of the clip. For instance, you have a video of 10 seconds. You start the range from 5 seconds and end it at 10 seconds. So, the first four seconds of the video will be cut from the entire clip.

**Features**

* Video cutting, cropping, and resizing
* Low-quality and old video restoration
* Video conversion from any format to MKV or MP4

**Pros**

* Handbrake is free
* You can convert batch videos with ease
* It supports MAC, Windows, and Linux OS
* Allows you to import video files in all major formats
* The software comes with various video conversion presets

**Features**
