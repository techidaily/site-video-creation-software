<p><strong>Problem:</strong> Even after changing the resolution values to 1440 X 1080 using the final cut pro app, the video frame covers the widescreen without modifying the size concerning the assigned values.</p>
<p>Solution 1: In this situation, you must fix the default spatial fit settings to fill the format in the final cut pro app. When you import the videos for editing, automatically the video would have taken this fit option. Before working on the aspect ratio values, modify the fit to fill settings so that you can crop the unwanted areas in the video frames precisely.</p>

<p>You can follow the step-by-step instructions that are given below to learn how to add 3D effects to a video with Wondershare Filmora:</p>
<p><strong>Step 1: Import Source Video and Add It to the Timeline</strong></p>
<p>After installing Wondershare Filmora on Windows 10 or Windows 11, launch the program, click anywhere inside the Media box present at the upper-left section of the interface, and locate and import the source video to the program. Next, hover the mouse over the thumbnail of the video, click the <strong>+</strong> icon from the bottom-right corner.</p>
<p>When the confirmation box appears, either click <strong>Match to Media</strong> or <strong>Keep Project Settings</strong> to adjust the project settings according to the media clip or modify the media clip according to the project preferences while adding the footage to the Timeline respectively.</p>
<p><strong>Step 2: Add 3D Titles and Transitions</strong></p>
<p>Click <strong>Titles</strong> from the toolbox at the top, type <strong>3D Titles</strong> in the <strong>Search titles</strong> field present at the upper section of the upper-left box, and click <strong>3D titles</strong> from the suggestions list.</p>
<p><img  
                     lazyload
                     src="/images/loading.svg"

                      alt="find 3d title effects filmora"
                ></p>
<p>From all the available 3D title presets that appear next, drag the one you like to the Timeline, and place it above the video track.</p>
<p><img  
                     lazyload
                     src="/images/loading.svg"

                      alt="add 3d title effects to video filmora"
                ></p>
<p>After this, double-click the placeholder text in the <strong>Preview</strong> window, and replace it with your caption. You can customize the font, color, and alignment of the text from the options that appear on left. Click <strong>OK</strong> from the lower-left area of the left pane to exit the editing mode. Repeat the process for all the texts that the preset has. Optionally, drag the sides of the 3D title in the Timeline to specify its duration of visibility on the screen.</p>
<p><img  
                     lazyload
                     src="/images/loading.svg"

                      alt="edit 3d title effects in video filmora"
                ></p>
<p>To add the transitions, click <strong>Media</strong> from the toolbox at the top, click <strong>Import Media</strong> from the <strong>Media</strong> box, and repeat the process explained earlier to add a new video clip to the Timeline. Make sure that both the clips are on the same track, and are placed next to each other. Now, go to <strong>Transitions</strong> from the toolbox, and drag and place your preferred transition effect between the two media clips in the Timeline. Optionally you can drag the sides of the transition inwards or outwards to increase or decrease the speed of the effect respectively.</p>
<p><img  
                     lazyload
                     src="/images/loading.svg"

                      alt="add 3d transition effects to video filmora"
                ></p>
<p>After this, move the <strong>Playhead</strong> (<strong>Skimmer</strong>) to the beginning of the Timeline, and press the <strong>Spacebar</strong> on your keyboard to preview the video.</p>
<p><strong>Note:</strong> It is a good practice to preview your video several times during the entire editing process. This will help you identify the error sooner, and you will be able to address the issue with fewer hassles.</p>
<p><strong>Step 3: Add Elements and Effects</strong></p>
<p>Go to <strong>Elements</strong> from the toolbox, drag your preferred element from the upper-left box to the Timeline, and place it on a new track. You can drag the sides of the element in the Timeline to increase or decrease its visibility during video playback.</p>
<p><img  
                     lazyload
                     src="/images/loading.svg"

                      alt="add 3d elements to video filmora"
                ></p>
<p>To add effects, go to <strong>Effects</strong> from the toolbox, drag your preferred effect from the upper-left box, and place it on a new layer in the Timeline. As it is with other entities, you can drag the sides of the effect to increase or decrease the duration of its impact on the video. Next, double-click the <strong>Effects</strong> layer in the Timeline, and use the available options in the box to make further adjustments.</p>
<p><strong>Note:</strong> The options that you get by double-clicking the effect in the Timeline may vary according to the adjustments it allows you to make.</p>
<p><img  
                     lazyload
                     src="/images/loading.svg"
                     data-src="https://images.wondershare.com/filmora/article-images/add-3d-effects-to-video-filmora.jpg"
                      alt="add 3d effects to video filmora"
                ></p>
<p>Once this is done, preview the video, click <strong>Export</strong> from the top-center, and use the tabs and options on the <strong>Export</strong> box to export the modified video in your preferred format.</p>
<p><strong>Conclusion</strong></p>
<p>If you are new to the VFX and video editing industry, trying hands with the Photos app would give you a fair idea about how things work. Once you are well-versed or if you are already a post-production professional, you can and you must go for a dedicated program like Wondershare Filmora that not only has an intuitive interface, it is also equipped with a plethora of presets to add 3D titles, elements, transitions, and effects to the videos without much hassle.</p>

<p>You can follow the step-by-step instructions that are given below to learn how to add 3D effects to a video with Wondershare Filmora:</p>
<p><strong>Step 1: Import Source Video and Add It to the Timeline</strong></p>
<p>After installing Wondershare Filmora on Windows 10 or Windows 11, launch the program, click anywhere inside the Media box present at the upper-left section of the interface, and locate and import the source video to the program. Next, hover the mouse over the thumbnail of the video, click the <strong>+</strong> icon from the bottom-right corner.</p>
<p>When the confirmation box appears, either click <strong>Match to Media</strong> or <strong>Keep Project Settings</strong> to adjust the project settings according to the media clip or modify the media clip according to the project preferences while adding the footage to the Timeline respectively.</p>
<p><strong>Step 2: Add 3D Titles and Transitions</strong></p>
<p>Click <strong>Titles</strong> from the toolbox at the top, type <strong>3D Titles</strong> in the <strong>Search titles</strong> field present at the upper section of the upper-left box, and click <strong>3D titles</strong> from the suggestions list.</p>
<p><img

                     src="/images/loading.svg"

                      alt="find 3d title effects filmora"
                ></p>
<p>From all the available 3D title presets that appear next, drag the one you like to the Timeline, and place it above the video track.</p>
<p><img  
                     lazyload
                     src="/images/loading.svg"

                      alt="add 3d title effects to video filmora"
                ></p>
<p>After this, double-click the placeholder text in the <strong>Preview</strong> window, and replace it with your caption. You can customize the font, color, and alignment of the text from the options that appear on left. Click <strong>OK</strong> from the lower-left area of the left pane to exit the editing mode. Repeat the process for all the texts that the preset has. Optionally, drag the sides of the 3D title in the Timeline to specify its duration of visibility on the screen.</p>

                ></p>
<p>To add the transitions, click <strong>Media</strong> from the toolbox at the top, click <strong>Import Media</strong> from the <strong>Media</strong> box, and repeat the process explained earlier to add a new video clip to the Timeline. Make sure that both the clips are on the same track, and are placed next to each other. Now, go to <strong>Transitions</strong> from the toolbox, and drag and place your preferred transition effect between the two media clips in the Timeline. Optionally you can drag the sides of the transition inwards or outwards to increase or decrease the speed of the effect respectively.</p>
<p><img  
                     lazyload

                ></p>
<p>After this, move the <strong>Playhead</strong> (<strong>Skimmer</strong>) to the beginning of the Timeline, and press the <strong>Spacebar</strong> on your keyboard to preview the video.</p>
<p><strong>Note:</strong> It is a good practice to preview your video several times during the entire editing process. This will help you identify the error sooner, and you will be able to address the issue with fewer hassles.</p>
<p><strong>Step 3: Add Elements and Effects</strong></p>
<p>Go to <strong>Elements</strong> from the toolbox, drag your preferred element from the upper-left box to the Timeline, and place it on a new track. You can drag the sides of the element in the Timeline to increase or decrease its visibility during video playback.</p>
<p><img

                      alt="add 3d elements to video filmora"
                ></p>
<p>To add effects, go to <strong>Effects</strong> from the toolbox, drag your preferred effect from the upper-left box, and place it on a new layer in the Timeline. As it is with other entities, you can drag the sides of the effect to increase or decrease the duration of its impact on the video. Next, double-click the <strong>Effects</strong> layer in the Timeline, and use the available options in the box to make further adjustments.</p>
<p><strong>Note:</strong> The options that you get by double-clicking the effect in the Timeline may vary according to the adjustments it allows you to make.</p>
<p><img  
                     lazyload
                     src="/images/loading.svg"

                      alt="add 3d effects to video filmora"
                ></p>
<p>Once this is done, preview the video, click <strong>Export</strong> from the top-center, and use the tabs and options on the <strong>Export</strong> box to export the modified video in your preferred format.</p>
<p><strong>Conclusion</strong></p>
<p>If you are new to the VFX and video editing industry, trying hands with the Photos app would give you a fair idea about how things work. Once you are well-versed or if you are already a post-production professional, you can and you must go for a dedicated program like Wondershare Filmora that not only has an intuitive interface, it is also equipped with a plethora of presets to add 3D titles, elements, transitions, and effects to the videos without much hassle.</p>

<p>For macOS 10.12 or later</p>
<p>You can follow the step-by-step instructions that are given below to learn how to add 3D effects to a video with Wondershare Filmora:</p>
<p><strong>Step 1: Import Source Video and Add It to the Timeline</strong></p>
<p>After installing Wondershare Filmora on Windows 10 or Windows 11, launch the program, click anywhere inside the Media box present at the upper-left section of the interface, and locate and import the source video to the program. Next, hover the mouse over the thumbnail of the video, click the <strong>+</strong> icon from the bottom-right corner.</p>
<p>When the confirmation box appears, either click <strong>Match to Media</strong> or <strong>Keep Project Settings</strong> to adjust the project settings according to the media clip or modify the media clip according to the project preferences while adding the footage to the Timeline respectively.</p>
<p><strong>Step 2: Add 3D Titles and Transitions</strong></p>
<p>Click <strong>Titles</strong> from the toolbox at the top, type <strong>3D Titles</strong> in the <strong>Search titles</strong> field present at the upper section of the upper-left box, and click <strong>3D titles</strong> from the suggestions list.</p>
<p><img  
                     lazyload
                     src="/images/loading.svg"
                     data-src="https://images.wondershare.com/filmora/article-images/find-3d-title-effects-filmora.jpg"
                      alt="find 3d title effects filmora"
                ></p>
<p>From all the available 3D title presets that appear next, drag the one you like to the Timeline, and place it above the video track.</p>
<p><img  
                     lazyload
                     src="/images/loading.svg"
                     data-src="https://images.wondershare.com/filmora/article-images/add-3d-title-effects-to-video-filmora.jpg"
                      alt="add 3d title effects to video filmora"
                ></p>
<p>After this, double-click the placeholder text in the <strong>Preview</strong> window, and replace it with your caption. You can customize the font, color, and alignment of the text from the options that appear on left. Click <strong>OK</strong> from the lower-left area of the left pane to exit the editing mode. Repeat the process for all the texts that the preset has. Optionally, drag the sides of the 3D title in the Timeline to specify its duration of visibility on the screen.</p>
<p><img  
                     lazyload
                     src="/images/loading.svg"
                     data-src="https://images.wondershare.com/filmora/article-images/edit-3d-title-effects-in-video-filmora.jpg"
                      alt="edit 3d title effects in video filmora"
                ></p>
<p>To add the transitions, click <strong>Media</strong> from the toolbox at the top, click <strong>Import Media</strong> from the <strong>Media</strong> box, and repeat the process explained earlier to add a new video clip to the Timeline. Make sure that both the clips are on the same track, and are placed next to each other. Now, go to <strong>Transitions</strong> from the toolbox, and drag and place your preferred transition effect between the two media clips in the Timeline. Optionally you can drag the sides of the transition inwards or outwards to increase or decrease the speed of the effect respectively.</p>
<p><img  
                     lazyload
                     src="/images/loading.svg"
                     data-src="https://images.wondershare.com/filmora/article-images/add-3d-transition-effects-to-video-filmora.jpg"
                      alt="add 3d transition effects to video filmora"
                ></p>
<p>After this, move the <strong>Playhead</strong> (<strong>Skimmer</strong>) to the beginning of the Timeline, and press the <strong>Spacebar</strong> on your keyboard to preview the video.</p>
<p><strong>Note:</strong> It is a good practice to preview your video several times during the entire editing process. This will help you identify the error sooner, and you will be able to address the issue with fewer hassles.</p>
<p><strong>Step 3: Add Elements and Effects</strong></p>
<p>Go to <strong>Elements</strong> from the toolbox, drag your preferred element from the upper-left box to the Timeline, and place it on a new track. You can drag the sides of the element in the Timeline to increase or decrease its visibility during video playback.</p>
<p><img  
                     lazyload
                     src="/images/loading.svg"
                     data-src="https://images.wondershare.com/filmora/article-images/add-3d-elements-to-video-filmora.jpg"
                      alt="add 3d elements to video filmora"
                ></p>
<p>To add effects, go to <strong>Effects</strong> from the toolbox, drag your preferred effect from the upper-left box, and place it on a new layer in the Timeline. As it is with other entities, you can drag the sides of the effect to increase or decrease the duration of its impact on the video. Next, double-click the <strong>Effects</strong> layer in the Timeline, and use the available options in the box to make further adjustments.</p>
<p><strong>Note:</strong> The options that you get by double-clicking the effect in the Timeline may vary according to the adjustments it allows you to make.</p>
<p><img  
                     lazyload
                     src="/images/loading.svg"
                     data-src="https://images.wondershare.com/filmora/article-images/add-3d-effects-to-video-filmora.jpg"
                      alt="add 3d effects to video filmora"
                ></p>
<p>Once this is done, preview the video, click <strong>Export</strong> from the top-center, and use the tabs and options on the <strong>Export</strong> box to export the modified video in your preferred format.</p>
<p><strong>Conclusion</strong></p>
<p>If you are new to the VFX and video editing industry, trying hands with the Photos app would give you a fair idea about how things work. Once you are well-versed or if you are already a post-production professional, you can and you must go for a dedicated program like Wondershare Filmora that not only has an intuitive interface, it is also equipped with a plethora of presets to add 3D titles, elements, transitions, and effects to the videos without much hassle.</p>

One is follower ads and other is sponsored ads.</p>

<p><strong>Pro</strong>: Ideal for designing simple 3D animations and models.</p>
<p><strong>Con</strong>: It has an old-fashioned interface. Also, the built-render (RenderMan) feature is difficult to use by beginners.</p>
<p>K-3D is an animation and 3D modeling software. You can download this tool for free on your Mac. Besides, you can also install and run it on your Windows and Linux systems. If you look at the design, you will find that the software is quite old. But don’t judge a book by its cover. Why so? It is because K-3D is one of the strongest and most versatile tools for 3D artists with many options.</p>
<p>For example, K-3D offers extremely systematic and methodological workflows. You can easily adjust the properties of the features in real-time and get instant results. It has a node-oriented visualization pipeline to enjoy more freedom. That means you can create animation using a variety of combinations.</p>
<p>One of the best things about K-3D is that it has three subdivisions of animation. You can work on your model on one side while showing the other side in a mirrored form. Then, experience the final result combined together. And in case you need to make the changes to the end results, you can simply work on the first subdivision and savor automatic changes to the results.</p>
<p>K-3D has an advanced redo and undo mechanism to ensure you can go back or move forward to make corrections or amendments without limits. Additionally, the tool is developed keeping in mind all the industrial standards. For instance, it has complete support and integration of native RenderMan™ to its user interface. This is an excellent feature because most free animation software for Mac requires third-party render plugins.</p>
<p><strong>Features:</strong></p>
<ul>
<li>Parametric workflow.</li>
<li>2D and 3D animation tools.</li>
<li>Allows Python and K3DScript scripting.</li>
</ul>

<p><strong>Pro</strong>: Advanced tools with numerous animation options and online training material.</p>
<p><strong>Con</strong>: Not suitable for beginners.</p>
<p>If you love 2D animation, then you’ll surely love Krita. It is entirely free software available on Mac, Windows, and Linux. Also, it offers a full platform for drawing and frame-by-frame animation.</p>
<p>The number one reason for adoring Krita is its brush library. There are more than 100 professional brushes to give you a wide range of effects. Moreover, the strokes are pretty amazing and similar to Adobe Photoshop or Adobe Illustrator.</p>
<p>Another great thing about Krita is the brush stabilization feature designed for shaky hands. You can add a stabilizer to your chosen brush to smoothen its flow. Besides, there’s a special Dynamic Brush tool to make animation more fun. At the same time, you can also customize your brushes through different brush engines, including filter engines, color smudge engines, and many more.</p>
<p>Apart from the basic brush options, the preloaded vector tools are next to admire. These tools help you make great comic panels. All you need to do is choose and drag the word bubble template on your canvas. Then, make changes with the anchor point to make new shapes. At the same time, you can also add text to your animation by using the text tool.</p>
<p>Last but not least, there’s a wrap-around mode to create seamless patterns and textures. That means the image or drawing makes its own references along the x-axis and y-axis. This gives you the freedom to continue painting and enjoy updates to your animation instantly.</p>
<p><strong>Features:</strong></p>
<ul>
<li>HDR painting.</li>
<li>PSD support.</li>
<li>Python scripting.</li>
<li>Selection and transformation tools.</li>
<li>Proper group, filter, vector, and file layer management.</li>

<p><strong>Pro</strong>: Ideal for designing simple 3D animations and models.</p>
<p><strong>Con</strong>: It has an old-fashioned interface. Also, the built-render (RenderMan) feature is difficult to use by beginners.</p>
<p>K-3D is an animation and 3D modeling software. You can download this tool for free on your Mac. Besides, you can also install and run it on your Windows and Linux systems. If you look at the design, you will find that the software is quite old. But don’t judge a book by its cover. Why so? It is because K-3D is one of the strongest and most versatile tools for 3D artists with many options.</p>
<p>For example, K-3D offers extremely systematic and methodological workflows. You can easily adjust the properties of the features in real-time and get instant results. It has a node-oriented visualization pipeline to enjoy more freedom. That means you can create animation using a variety of combinations.</p>
<p>One of the best things about K-3D is that it has three subdivisions of animation. You can work on your model on one side while showing the other side in a mirrored form. Then, experience the final result combined together. And in case you need to make the changes to the end results, you can simply work on the first subdivision and savor automatic changes to the results.</p>
<p>K-3D has an advanced redo and undo mechanism to ensure you can go back or move forward to make corrections or amendments without limits. Additionally, the tool is developed keeping in mind all the industrial standards. For instance, it has complete support and integration of native RenderMan™ to its user interface. This is an excellent feature because most free animation software for Mac requires third-party render plugins.</p>
<p><strong>Features:</strong></p>
<ul>
<li>Parametric workflow.</li>
<li>2D and 3D animation tools.</li>
<li>Allows Python and K3DScript scripting.</li>
</ul>

<p><strong>Pro</strong>: Advanced tools with numerous animation options and online training material.</p>
<p><strong>Con</strong>: Not suitable for beginners.</p>
<p>If you love 2D animation, then you’ll surely love Krita. It is entirely free software available on Mac, Windows, and Linux. Also, it offers a full platform for drawing and frame-by-frame animation.</p>
<p>The number one reason for adoring Krita is its brush library. There are more than 100 professional brushes to give you a wide range of effects. Moreover, the strokes are pretty amazing and similar to Adobe Photoshop or Adobe Illustrator.</p>
<p>Another great thing about Krita is the brush stabilization feature designed for shaky hands. You can add a stabilizer to your chosen brush to smoothen its flow. Besides, there’s a special Dynamic Brush tool to make animation more fun. At the same time, you can also customize your brushes through different brush engines, including filter engines, color smudge engines, and many more.</p>
<p>Apart from the basic brush options, the preloaded vector tools are next to admire. These tools help you make great comic panels. All you need to do is choose and drag the word bubble template on your canvas. Then, make changes with the anchor point to make new shapes. At the same time, you can also add text to your animation by using the text tool.</p>
<p>Last but not least, there’s a wrap-around mode to create seamless patterns and textures. That means the image or drawing makes its own references along the x-axis and y-axis. This gives you the freedom to continue painting and enjoy updates to your animation instantly.</p>
<p><strong>Features:</strong></p>
<ul>
<li>HDR painting.</li>
<li>PSD support.</li>
<li>Python scripting.</li>
<li>Selection and transformation tools.</li>
<li>Proper group, filter, vector, and file layer management.</li>
<li>Complete color management for extraordinary results.</li>
<li>Drawing assistant to help you with straight lines and vanishing points.</li>

<p><strong>Pro</strong>: Ideal for designing simple 3D animations and models.</p>
<p><strong>Con</strong>: It has an old-fashioned interface. Also, the built-render (RenderMan) feature is difficult to use by beginners.</p>
<p>K-3D is an animation and 3D modeling software. You can download this tool for free on your Mac. Besides, you can also install and run it on your Windows and Linux systems. If you look at the design, you will find that the software is quite old. But don’t judge a book by its cover. Why so? It is because K-3D is one of the strongest and most versatile tools for 3D artists with many options.</p>
<p>For example, K-3D offers extremely systematic and methodological workflows. You can easily adjust the properties of the features in real-time and get instant results. It has a node-oriented visualization pipeline to enjoy more freedom. That means you can create animation using a variety of combinations.</p>
<p>One of the best things about K-3D is that it has three subdivisions of animation. You can work on your model on one side while showing the other side in a mirrored form. Then, experience the final result combined together. And in case you need to make the changes to the end results, you can simply work on the first subdivision and savor automatic changes to the results.</p>
<p>K-3D has an advanced redo and undo mechanism to ensure you can go back or move forward to make corrections or amendments without limits. Additionally, the tool is developed keeping in mind all the industrial standards. For instance, it has complete support and integration of native RenderMan™ to its user interface. This is an excellent feature because most free animation software for Mac requires third-party render plugins.</p>
<p><strong>Features:</strong></p>
<ul>
<li>Parametric workflow.</li>
<li>2D and 3D animation tools.</li>
<li>Allows Python and K3DScript scripting.</li>
</ul>

<p><strong>Pro</strong>: Advanced tools with numerous animation options and online training material.</p>
<p><strong>Con</strong>: Not suitable for beginners.</p>
<p>If you love 2D animation, then you’ll surely love Krita. It is entirely free software available on Mac, Windows, and Linux. Also, it offers a full platform for drawing and frame-by-frame animation.</p>
<p>The number one reason for adoring Krita is its brush library. There are more than 100 professional brushes to give you a wide range of effects. Moreover, the strokes are pretty amazing and similar to Adobe Photoshop or Adobe Illustrator.</p>
<p>Another great thing about Krita is the brush stabilization feature designed for shaky hands. You can add a stabilizer to your chosen brush to smoothen its flow. Besides, there’s a special Dynamic Brush tool to make animation more fun. At the same time, you can also customize your brushes through different brush engines, including filter engines, color smudge engines, and many more.</p>
<p>Apart from the basic brush options, the preloaded vector tools are next to admire. These tools help you make great comic panels. All you need to do is choose and drag the word bubble template on your canvas. Then, make changes with the anchor point to make new shapes. At the same time, you can also add text to your animation by using the text tool.</p>
<p>Last but not least, there’s a wrap-around mode to create seamless patterns and textures. That means the image or drawing makes its own references along the x-axis and y-axis. This gives you the freedom to continue painting and enjoy updates to your animation instantly.</p>
<p><strong>Features:</strong></p>
<ul>
<li>HDR painting.</li>
<li>PSD support.</li>
<li>Python scripting.</li>
<li>Selection and transformation tools.</li>
<li>Proper group, filter, vector, and file layer management.</li>

<p><strong>Pro</strong>: Ideal for designing simple 3D animations and models.</p>
<p><strong>Con</strong>: It has an old-fashioned interface. Also, the built-render (RenderMan) feature is difficult to use by beginners.</p>
<p>K-3D is an animation and 3D modeling software. You can download this tool for free on your Mac. Besides, you can also install and run it on your Windows and Linux systems. If you look at the design, you will find that the software is quite old. But don’t judge a book by its cover. Why so? It is because K-3D is one of the strongest and most versatile tools for 3D artists with many options.</p>
<p>For example, K-3D offers extremely systematic and methodological workflows. You can easily adjust the properties of the features in real-time and get instant results. It has a node-oriented visualization pipeline to enjoy more freedom. That means you can create animation using a variety of combinations.</p>
<p>One of the best things about K-3D is that it has three subdivisions of animation. You can work on your model on one side while showing the other side in a mirrored form. Then, experience the final result combined together. And in case you need to make the changes to the end results, you can simply work on the first subdivision and savor automatic changes to the results.</p>
<p>K-3D has an advanced redo and undo mechanism to ensure you can go back or move forward to make corrections or amendments without limits. Additionally, the tool is developed keeping in mind all the industrial standards. For instance, it has complete support and integration of native RenderMan™ to its user interface. This is an excellent feature because most free animation software for Mac requires third-party render plugins.</p>
<p><strong>Features:</strong></p>
<ul>
<li>Parametric workflow.</li>
<li>2D and 3D animation tools.</li>
<li>Allows Python and K3DScript scripting.</li>
</ul>

<p><strong>Pro</strong>: Advanced tools with numerous animation options and online training material.</p>
<p><strong>Con</strong>: Not suitable for beginners.</p>
<p>If you love 2D animation, then you’ll surely love Krita. It is entirely free software available on Mac, Windows, and Linux. Also, it offers a full platform for drawing and frame-by-frame animation.</p>
<p>The number one reason for adoring Krita is its brush library. There are more than 100 professional brushes to give you a wide range of effects. Moreover, the strokes are pretty amazing and similar to Adobe Photoshop or Adobe Illustrator.</p>
<p>Another great thing about Krita is the brush stabilization feature designed for shaky hands. You can add a stabilizer to your chosen brush to smoothen its flow. Besides, there’s a special Dynamic Brush tool to make animation more fun. At the same time, you can also customize your brushes through different brush engines, including filter engines, color smudge engines, and many more.</p>
<p>Apart from the basic brush options, the preloaded vector tools are next to admire. These tools help you make great comic panels. All you need to do is choose and drag the word bubble template on your canvas. Then, make changes with the anchor point to make new shapes. At the same time, you can also add text to your animation by using the text tool.</p>
<p>Last but not least, there’s a wrap-around mode to create seamless patterns and textures. That means the image or drawing makes its own references along the x-axis and y-axis. This gives you the freedom to continue painting and enjoy updates to your animation instantly.</p>
<p><strong>Features:</strong></p>
<ul>
<li>HDR painting.</li>
<li>PSD support.</li>
<li>Python scripting.</li>
<li>Selection and transformation tools.</li>
<li>Proper group, filter, vector, and file layer management.</li>
<li>Complete color management for extraordinary results.</li>
<li>Drawing assistant to help you with straight lines and vanishing points.</li>
