## Part 1 Is There an App That Converts Voice Recording to Text?

Do apps that convert **speech to text** actually exist? The quick answer? Yes

Transcribe (shown in the image below), which is available for all iOS devices, is one such app. This tool, as you might be able to guess from the name, is able to transcribe spoken audio into text. It’s especially useful for creating notes (personal use), as it means you can have your thoughts written down in an instant without ever having to lift up a pen or type it down for yourself.

And, just to be very clear, there are many more **speech-to-text** apps like this one

![Transcribe - Speech to Text App](https://images.wondershare.com/filmora/article-images/2022/01/how-to-convert-speech-to-text%201.png)

## Part 2 How to Convert Audio to Text - FREE & No Time Limits

For this next part, we’ll be introducing a variety of different methods that you can use to convert **audio to text**. From apps, software, online solutions, etc. There are plenty of ways, so you can find the one that works best for you

### 01Online Speech-to-Text — VEED.IO

The first and most common way to turn **speech-to-text**—especially for those who want something more accessible no matter what device they are on—is online **speech-to-text MP3** converters A great example of one of these online tools is the MP3 to text converter, VEED-IO. The key feature here is that you won’t have to download or install anything to start using it Also, VEED.IO (and many other online **speech-to-text** converters) is FREE.

![Online MP3 to Text Converter](https://images.wondershare.com/filmora/article-images/2022/01/how-to-convert-speech-to-text%202.png)

### 02Windows Dictate

This next one is more of a live **audio-to-text** tool. Or rather, a live transcriber tool, but it can be useful despite the fact, especially since, once again, it is 100% free and FREE to use. What we’re talking about, in this case, is Windows Dictate. This is a built-in function for Windows OS users. It’s there to increase accessibility for those with vision impairment, but it’s also a great way of easily converting your **speech to text**.

![Windows - Speech | Dictate Feature](https://images.wondershare.com/filmora/article-images/2022/01/how-to-convert-speech-to-text%203.png)

### 03Smart Phone App - Transcribe

As mentioned earlier, there are apps out there that work in pretty much the same way. Another notable one, besides the app ‘Transcribe’ that we introduced earlier, is the iOS app called ‘Voice to Text Pro - Transcribe.’ This particular app offers advanced **speech-to-text** functionalities that will allow you to either transcribe live audio or upload an MP3 to transcribe. It also has support for over 150+ languages and has a convenient notes function for taking advantage of the transcription function.

![Voice-to-Text App](https://images.wondershare.com/filmora/article-images/2022/01/how-to-convert-speech-to-text%204.png)

### 04Google Docs

Another 100% FREE method of getting live **speech** **to text** is Google Doc’s “Voice Typing” function. You can turn this on at any time by making use of the command ‘Ctrl+Shift+S’ or by turning it on manually from the ‘Tools’ tab on a Google Document (shown in the image below). It’s a very easy way of getting your thoughts onto paper while working on other things.

![Voice Typing Feature](https://images.wondershare.com/filmora/article-images/2022/01/how-to-convert-speech-to-text%205.png)

### 05Apple Dictation (iOS, iPadOS, macOS)

If you’re a Mac user, then the second item on this list was probably of not much use to you. But, don’t worry, Windows Dictates has a Mac/iOS counterpart It’s in the form of Apple Dictation Again, it was set up to increase accessibility for users with visual impairment, but it can be pretty useful as well for the times when your hands are too busy to actively type your thoughts down.

You can turn on this feature by going to your device’s ‘Accessibility’ settings and enabling ‘Voice Control’ (as is shown in the image below). It will need to be downloaded and installed onto your device, but it should begin working pretty quickly after that.

![apple Voice Control Features](https://images.wondershare.com/filmora/article-images/2022/01/how-to-convert-speech-to-text%206.png)

For this next section, we’ll be introducing some other **speech-to-text** solutions. Specific ones this time though A URL for each tool will be provided, as well as a description of how each one works. It will be a mixed list, so expect both FREE & Paid solutions.

### 01Otter.ai

![ai Note-Taking Solution](https://images.wondershare.com/filmora/article-images/2022/01/how-to-convert-speech-to-text%207.png)
