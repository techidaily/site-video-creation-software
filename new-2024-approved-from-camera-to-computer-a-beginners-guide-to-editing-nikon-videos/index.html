<p>In addition, it’s a great idea to play the video in repeat mode when you find a certain piece of a video or an entire clip very intriguing and want to watch it again and again for yourself, your friends, or your intended audience on your social media account.</p>
<p>The loopers come in here because they help make the movie loop several times. In this article, we will share a list of free <strong>Video Looper</strong> online solutions that, according to their regulations, enable you to repeat a piece of video.</p>

Whenever Windows Media Player approaches the finish of a video, it gives you the option to repeat it manually, but it does not do it routinely.</p>
<p>Enabling the Repeat function, on the other hand, directs Media Player to play the video in a constant loop until you actively stop it or shut the software. Looping a video impacts the rest of the video from start to finish; Media Player does not only allow you to loop a portion of it but more.</p>
<p><strong>How to Loop Video in Windows Media Player?</strong></p>
<p><strong>Step 1:</strong> Drag your mouse pointer over the Media Player window in <strong>Now Playing</strong> status to reveal the <em>playback settings</em>.</p>
<p><strong>Step 2:</strong> To continually repeat the movie, click the <strong>Turn Repeat On</strong> button, denoted by a circular arrow, and glows blue when toggled on.</p>
<p>(<strong>Note:</strong> If you don’t see this button in a tiny playing window, select the square <strong>Maximize</strong> symbol or drag the video corners to expand the window bigger).</p>
<p><strong>Step 3:</strong> Until you exit the application or click the <strong>Turn Repeat Off</strong> icon, the Repeat option will repeat the whole video.</p>

You may also produce your videos and audio recordings and do rapid changes. Basic activities such as video flipping and clip splitting are included in edits.</p>
<p>You can record a screencast of a lecture, or capture a portion of the screen with QuickTime, which is ideal for creating a video lesson for an application. Using QuickTime, you may cut the length of video clips or merge many pieces into a single film. Drag the clips to a film window - QuickTime dynamically scales or trims them to fit the size of the movie.</p>
<p>It can also play your video on loop. Here’s how:</p>
<p><strong>How to Loop Video with QuickTime Player?</strong></p>
<p>If you’re using a Mac and wish to generate a video loop in QuickTime Player, follow these steps:</p>
<p><strong>Step 1:</strong> Launch the <strong>QuickTime</strong> player to watch any video.</p>
<p><strong>Step 2</strong>: In the taskbar at the top right of the screen, select <strong>View</strong>.</p>
<p><strong>Step 3:</strong> From the drop-down option, select <strong>Loop</strong>. And that’s it. You have put a video on loop.</p>

<p>These two video programs simplify setting up videos to run on repeat; they don’t allow you to loop individual video parts. To do so, you’ll need more powerful software, such as the well-known VLC Media Player.</p>
<h3 id="3-VLC-Media-Player"><a href="#3-VLC-Media-Player" class="headerlink" title="3. VLC Media Player"></a>3. <a class="link"   target="_blank" rel="noopener" href="https://www.videolan.org/vlc/" >VLC Media Player <i class="fa-regular fa-arrow-up-right-from-square fa-sm"></i></a></h3><p>The VLC media player is a program that allows you to play video and music files on your computer. The VLC player can operate on several operating systems, including Windows 2021, XP, and Mac OS X, because of the device’s powerful CPUs.</p>
<p>This makes the VLC Media Player an excellent alternative for anybody searching for a media player that can simultaneously run many programs. This free video editing program also includes special capabilities that allow it to execute numerous jobs simultaneously, including video editing, data transmission, graphic display, sound editing, and much more.</p>
<p> <strong>How to Loop a part of the Video in VLC Media Player Continuously?</strong></p>
<p>Create a beginning point A and an ending point B, which are in the center of VLC’s timeline. There is a control button for the A to B looping function in the Advanced Controls. The starting and ending positions inside a media file can be specified by bringing up the advanced controls first. Now follow these steps to put a video on loop in the VLC media player:</p>
<p><strong>Step 1:</strong> Open the video with VLC media player. Go to <strong>View</strong>. Select the <strong>Advanced Controls</strong> option.</p>
<p><img

                ></p>
<p><strong>Step 2</strong>: Go to the bottom of the VLC media player, and you will find 4 controls above the play button. Click the third button <strong>Loop from Piont A to Point B continuously</strong> to mark the starting point of the loop; and then click the third button again to mark the end of the loop.</p>

                ></p>
<p><strong>Step 3:</strong> Click the Play button and you will find the video is playing loop. Until you press the Loop from point A to point B option for the third time to discontinue the looped playback, the segment of the clip you’ve put up will keep on playing on loop.</p>

You may also loop videos straight in the iMovie software; however, you’ll need to utilize QuickTime to loop movies continually if you want to export them. Here are the quick and easy ways to loop a movie into iMovie.</p>
<p><strong>How to Loop Video in iMovie?</strong></p>
<p><strong>Step 1: Open</strong> iMovie and then the video clip you want to loop in.</p>
<p><strong>Step 2</strong>: Select the <strong>Loop Playback</strong> option from the <strong>View</strong> menu. Once the video begins to play, it will loop indefinitely until you stop it.</p>

If you wish to create a looping video, you’ll need to download a video editing tool. Here we will cover the best free video looper for you and how you can create a loop video.</p>

Whenever Windows Media Player approaches the finish of a video, it gives you the option to repeat it manually, but it does not do it routinely.</p>
<p>Enabling the Repeat function, on the other hand, directs Media Player to play the video in a constant loop until you actively stop it or shut the software. Looping a video impacts the rest of the video from start to finish; Media Player does not only allow you to loop a portion of it but more.</p>
<p><strong>How to Loop Video in Windows Media Player?</strong></p>
<p><strong>Step 1:</strong> Drag your mouse pointer over the Media Player window in <strong>Now Playing</strong> status to reveal the <em>playback settings</em>.</p>
<p><strong>Step 2:</strong> To continually repeat the movie, click the <strong>Turn Repeat On</strong> button, denoted by a circular arrow, and glows blue when toggled on.</p>
<p>(<strong>Note:</strong> If you don’t see this button in a tiny playing window, select the square <strong>Maximize</strong> symbol or drag the video corners to expand the window bigger).</p>
<p><strong>Step 3:</strong> Until you exit the application or click the <strong>Turn Repeat Off</strong> icon, the Repeat option will repeat the whole video.</p>

You may also produce your videos and audio recordings and do rapid changes. Basic activities such as video flipping and clip splitting are included in edits.</p>
<p>You can record a screencast of a lecture, or capture a portion of the screen with QuickTime, which is ideal for creating a video lesson for an application. Using QuickTime, you may cut the length of video clips or merge many pieces into a single film. Drag the clips to a film window - QuickTime dynamically scales or trims them to fit the size of the movie.</p>
<p>It can also play your video on loop. Here’s how:</p>
<p><strong>How to Loop Video with QuickTime Player?</strong></p>
<p>If you’re using a Mac and wish to generate a video loop in QuickTime Player, follow these steps:</p>
<p><strong>Step 1:</strong> Launch the <strong>QuickTime</strong> player to watch any video.</p>
<p><strong>Step 2</strong>: In the taskbar at the top right of the screen, select <strong>View</strong>.</p>
<p><strong>Step 3:</strong> From the drop-down option, select <strong>Loop</strong>. And that’s it. You have put a video on loop.</p>

<p>These two video programs simplify setting up videos to run on repeat; they don’t allow you to loop individual video parts. To do so, you’ll need more powerful software, such as the well-known VLC Media Player.</p>
<h3 id="3-VLC-Media-Player-3"><a href="#3-VLC-Media-Player-3" class="headerlink" title="3. VLC Media Player"></a>3. <a class="link"   target="_blank" rel="noopener" href="https://www.videolan.org/vlc/" >VLC Media Player <i class="fa-regular fa-arrow-up-right-from-square fa-sm"></i></a></h3><p>The VLC media player is a program that allows you to play video and music files on your computer. The VLC player can operate on several operating systems, including Windows 2021, XP, and Mac OS X, because of the device’s powerful CPUs.</p>
<p>This makes the VLC Media Player an excellent alternative for anybody searching for a media player that can simultaneously run many programs. This free video editing program also includes special capabilities that allow it to execute numerous jobs simultaneously, including video editing, data transmission, graphic display, sound editing, and much more.</p>
<p> <strong>How to Loop a part of the Video in VLC Media Player Continuously?</strong></p>
<p>Create a beginning point A and an ending point B, which are in the center of VLC’s timeline. There is a control button for the A to B looping function in the Advanced Controls. The starting and ending positions inside a media file can be specified by bringing up the advanced controls first. Now follow these steps to put a video on loop in the VLC media player:</p>
<p><strong>Step 1:</strong> Open the video with VLC media player. Go to <strong>View</strong>. Select the <strong>Advanced Controls</strong> option.</p>
<p><img  
                     lazyload

                ></p>
<p><strong>Step 2</strong>: Go to the bottom of the VLC media player, and you will find 4 controls above the play button. Click the third button <strong>Loop from Piont A to Point B continuously</strong> to mark the starting point of the loop; and then click the third button again to mark the end of the loop.</p>

                      alt="vlc media player loop part of video"
                ></p>
<p><strong>Step 3:</strong> Click the Play button and you will find the video is playing loop. Until you press the Loop from point A to point B option for the third time to discontinue the looped playback, the segment of the clip you’ve put up will keep on playing on loop.</p>

You may also loop videos straight in the iMovie software; however, you’ll need to utilize QuickTime to loop movies continually if you want to export them. Here are the quick and easy ways to loop a movie into iMovie.</p>
<p><strong>How to Loop Video in iMovie?</strong></p>
<p><strong>Step 1: Open</strong> iMovie and then the video clip you want to loop in.</p>
<p><strong>Step 2</strong>: Select the <strong>Loop Playback</strong> option from the <strong>View</strong> menu. Once the video begins to play, it will loop indefinitely until you stop it.</p>

<p>Did you know your Mac device comes with a built-in speech-to-text feature? So whether you use a laptop or desktop, you can generate text from your voice through your device’s microphone. Officially known as Dictation, the app allows you to transcribe text anywhere you can type it. So, for example, you can use Apple Dictation for your messaging and word processing apps.</p>
<p>The feature has been available since macOS Sierra as a free built-in feature. Earlier versions of Apple Dictation relied on its voice recognition software. However, it now relies on Siri for users of macOS Catalina onwards.</p>
<p>Typically, the app allows you to transcribe thirty seconds and below of audio. However, you can enable Enhanced dictation for longer transcription times. According to most users, the app is suitable for getting the first draft of your assignment, which you can manually edit later.</p>
<p>Follow these steps to enable Apple Dictation on your Mac:</p>
<ol>
<li>Tap the Apple logo on the top-left toolbar of your screen and select <strong>System Preferences</strong> from the resulting menu.</li>
<li>Click on the <strong>Keyboard</strong> option from the system preferences screen.</li>
<li>Once there, click on the <strong>Dictation</strong> option located at the top of the menu.</li>
<li>Select <strong>On</strong> to activate the app in its default mode. In addition, you can check the <strong>Use Enhanced Dictation</strong> box to enable additional functions such as offline use and text commands like bold and italics.</li>
<li>Finally, select your language from the dropdown menu and choose a shortcut key.</li>
</ol>
<p>Please note that you need to speak your punctuation loudly when using Apple Dictation. Otherwise, the app will consider them as regular words.</p>

                ></p>
<p>Another option to consider is speech-to-text Microsoft Word Mac. The app is free to use and relies on Microsoft Azure Speech Services to transcribe text. Below are the requirements to use speech-to-text word mac.</p>
<ul>
<li>An external microphone for your Mac desktop, or you can use your built-in microphone for your MacBook. This is because speech-to-text on Microsoft word mac only allows input with a microphone rather than an audio file upload.</li>
<li>An active Office 365 subscription. Please note you need to log in to your account for the app to function.</li>
<li>Insider builds 16.32 (19120802) and above.</li>
<li>An active internet connection.</li>
</ul>
<p>Once you have everything set up, follow these steps to use speech-to-text on Word.</p>
<ol>
<li>Launch Microsoft Word from your desktop.</li>
<li>Click on the <strong>Dictate</strong> button from the top menu of your Word document, and wait for the red dot to appear. The button features a microphone for easy identification.</li>
<li>Once the dot appears, start speaking to transcribe your text. Ensure you are in a quiet environment for the best results. In addition, speak louder when transcribing punctuations.</li>
<li>Click on the Dictate button to finish the transcription.</li>

<p>Google Docs is arguably the market’s most accurate free speech-to-text service. In addition, it allows you to transcribe your voice to text and format documents with your voice. However, you can only use the service through the Chrome browser.</p>
<p>Follow these steps to activate Google Docs voice typing on your Mac device:</p>
<ol>
<li>Launch the <strong>Chrome</strong> browser on your macOS and select <strong>Docs</strong> from the app menu. Please note you will need an active Google account to use the service.</li>
<li>Open a new document and click on the <strong>Tools</strong> tab from the top menu.</li>
<li>Select <strong>Voice Typing</strong> from the menu to access speech-to-text on Google Docs.</li>
<li>Tap the microphone to start transcribing, and tap it again to finish.</li>

<p>Dragon Dictate is arguably the best dictation software currently on the market. According to most users, its accuracy and feature sets are next to none. For example, the Smart Format Rules learn how you represent dates, numbers, and abbreviations, resulting in less editing work for you. The Dragon Dictate app is free to download from the Apple Store.</p>
<p>Dragon for Mac users reports a dictation accuracy of nearly 99%, which is excellent in the speech-to-text software category. All of Nuance’s Dragon products use deep learning technology to capture your accent and cadence. As such, the app gets better at transcribing your text as you continue using it. In addition, dragon for Mac professional allows you to transcribe audio clips from uploaded files. For example, you can import audio from your iPhone to your Dragon Dictate workspace and transcribe it hassle-free.</p>
<p>Unfortunately, you cannot get a stand-alone dragon app for Mac. This is because Nuance discontinued its development in 2018. In addition, Microsoft’s acquisition of the company in 2021 proves that the decision is permanent. However, you can still use the Windows version of Dragon through Parallels, which allows you to run macOS and Windows simultaneously. In addition, this method also works for M1 Macs.</p>

Let’s take a closer look at what they have to offer.</p>
<h4 id="2-BeFunky"><a href="#2-BeFunky" class="headerlink" title="2. BeFunky"></a>2. BeFunky</h4><p>Befunky is one of the best photo editors you can find online, which is why it is hardly surprising that it offers cartoonization effects. In fact, you can choose from <strong>five different cartoonization effects</strong> that are all equally impressive.</p>
<p>All of the cartoon effects Befunky has to offer are located in the Artsy menu, and you just have to click on Cartoonizer DLX, Cross Hatch DLX, Pop Art DLX, or Graphic Novel DLX effects in order to apply them to your photo. Furthermore, you can use the Erase mode if you don’t want to catoonize the entire photo or head over to the Adjust menu to specify the amount of the effect you’ll apply and increase or decrease the photo’s sharpness.</p>
<p>Go to <a class="link"   target="_blank" rel="noopener" href="https://www.befunky.com/features/photo-to-cartoon/" >https://www.befunky.com/features/photo-to-cartoon/ <i class="fa-regular fa-arrow-up-right-from-square fa-sm"></i></a> and you can then turn your photos to cartoon easily in BeFunky.</p>

Lunapic</h4><p>This is yet another online photo editing platform that gives you access to a broad range of photo editing options for free. Even though a bit outdated, the Lunapic’s interface resembles Photoshop’s interface, so you won’t need much time to get used to it if you ever used Adobe’s iconic photo editing software.</p>
<p>Once you’ve uploaded a photo, you just have to go to the Effects menu and select the Cartoon option. Lunapic will then automatically apply the effect to the photo you uploaded and you just need to preview the image before you save it.

The Pro Cartoonizer feature this platform offers is only available if you purchase one of the available subscription plans.</p>
