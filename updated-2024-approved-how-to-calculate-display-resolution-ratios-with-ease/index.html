<p>Size, formats, and resolution… What are pixels exactly doing with it?</p>

<p>So let’s review some basics on pixel calculator ratio to create an easy life, your workflow more productive, and your photos of the ideal size for the intended purpose.</p>

<h2 id="Part-1-What-is-Pixel-Aspect-Ratio"><a href="#Part-1-What-is-Pixel-Aspect-Ratio" class="headerlink" title="Part 1 What is Pixel Aspect Ratio?"></a>Part 1 What is Pixel Aspect Ratio?</h2><p>A digital image is not a single non-dividable thing. You’ll see that your photo is like a mosaic formed by small tiles if you zoom in far enough, which are known as pixels in photography.</p>
<p>The amount of these pixels and the way they are divided are the two elements that you’re required to take into account to know more about the resolution and <strong>pixel</strong> <strong>calculator ratio</strong>.</p>
<p>The Pixel Aspect Ratio is simply the latest way of defining the length of one side of a pixel in context to the length of the other.</p>
<p>Let’s say the ratio is 1:1; each side of the pixel is the same length as the other, also known as a square in pixels.</p>
<p>If the ratio is 2:1, it means that one side is twice the length of the other.</p>
<p><strong>NOTE</strong>: The ‘Aspect Ratio’ does not define the actual or exact length of the side of a pixel is, just its “relative” size of one side to the other. The actual length will depend on how much you shrink or stretch a photo when recreating it.

<p><strong>How it works:</strong></p>
<p>This <strong>pixel ratio calculator</strong> converts pixel dimensions to aspect ratios. It is an online free tool that assists you in calculating the aspect ratio value of an object or a photo.</p>
<p>The conversion can be carried in both ways, aspect ratio to pixels and pixels to aspect ratio. This screen resolution calculator offers a powerful and simple tool that can convert the ratio of images to pixels resolution and pixels to ratio dimensions.</p>
<p>You need to provide Pixels Width and Pixels Height to calculate the aspect ratio; the aspect ratio will be automatically calculated.</p>
<p>You need to provide Ratio Height and Ratio Width to calculate pixel resolutions. Both the Pixels Width and Height will get automatically calculated.</p>

<p>As we already discussed, an aspect ratio defines width to height. The still picture and video frames have a frame aspect ratio. The pixels that create the frame have a pixel aspect ratio (sometimes called PAR).</p>
<p>Different video recording standards have different aspect ratios. For instance, you record video for television in either a 16:9 or a 4:3 frame aspect ratio.</p>
<p>You set the frame and pixel aspect when you create a project in Adobe Premiere Pro. Once you set these ratios, you can’t change them for that project. However, you can edit the aspect ratio of a sequence. You can also use assets made with different aspect ratios in the project.</p>
<p>Premiere Pro automatically compensates for the pixel aspect ratio of source files.</p>
<p>If an asset still feels distorted, you can manually mention its pixel aspect ratio. But that isn’t very clear, especially for a beginner. This is why we recommend doing the following.</p>

<p>Thus, using the Wondershare Filmora along with the <strong>pixel ratio calculator</strong> makes a difference!</p>
<h2 id="Part-4-Difference-among-Pixel-Aspect-Ratio-Display-Aspect-Ratio-and-Storage-Aspect-Ratio"><a href="#Part-4-Difference-among-Pixel-Aspect-Ratio-Display-Aspect-Ratio-and-Storage-Aspect-Ratio" class="headerlink" title="Part 4 Difference among Pixel Aspect Ratio, Display Aspect Ratio, and Storage Aspect Ratio"></a>Part 4 Difference among Pixel Aspect Ratio, Display Aspect Ratio, and Storage Aspect Ratio</h2><p>Although the image aspect ratio comes from its width and height, it also contains multiple subsets that help to define image proportions properly.</p>
<p>1 - <strong>Pixel aspect ratio</strong></p>
<p>Pixel aspect ratio (PAR) is the proportion of the specific pixels within an image. They are generally square within the pixel aspect ratio of 1:1.</p>
<p>But sometimes, specific images are optimized for certain types of displays. And, they have rectangular pixels with an aspect ratio of 4:3 or similar.</p>
<p>2 - <strong>Display aspect ratio</strong></p>
<p>The display aspect ratio (DAR) is the designers’ most frequent aspect ratio and gets generally synced with the general term.</p>
<p>As the name suggests, the display aspect ratio refers to the proportions of an image as it appears on different screens out there.</p>
<p>Some devices, such as televisions and cameras, have a fixed DAR for images to display nicely on these devices.</p>
<p>They need optimization for their specific or respective aspect ratio. For instance, a typical display aspect ratio for the widescreen video on a television screen or monitor screen is 16:9.</p>
<p>They appear distorted when images with different aspect ratios are presented on these devices. Digital SLR camera sensors also consist of a fixed display aspect ratio, which controls how pictures captured by the camera will be displayed and saved.</p>
<p>3 - <strong>Storage aspect ratio</strong></p>
<p>Storage aspect ratio, commonly known as (SAR) is an aspect ratio formula that concerns specifically to encoded digital video files. SAR refers to the height and the width relationship in video frame size, and it is required to be consistent among all individual frames.</p>
<p>SAR x PAR &#x3D; DAR for max widescreen videos in a usual used formula.</p>
<h2 id="Part-1-Part-5-How-Aspect-Ratios-Affect-UI-UX-Design"><a href="#Part-1-Part-5-How-Aspect-Ratios-Affect-UI-UX-Design" class="headerlink" title="Part 1 Part 5: How Aspect Ratios Affect UI&#x2F;UX Design?"></a>Part 1 Part 5: How Aspect Ratios Affect UI&#x2F;UX Design?</h2><p>Aspect ratios play a vital part in any project that consists of displaying and capturing photographs, videos, or other image-based files in an ideal manner. The camera’s fixed aspect ratio can considerably impact, especially for photographers.</p>
<p>And for videographers or anyone working with slideshows, animations, and other motion projects, the aspect ratio is a prominent element for correct display on mobile devices and widescreen.</p>
<p>But even in the environment of responsive web design, problems can arise, such as when an image is not adjustable for display without compromising its quality or content.</p>
<p>A small example is when you need a square image with a 1:1 aspect ratio to insert into a rectangular box on a web page. To accommodate varying image size requirements, proportions and size may need adjustment.</p>
<p>In an increasingly picture-driven digital world, videos and images that look even slightly out of the way add to a visitor’s negative impression of a site. Besides those forced into the wrong configurations can even interfere with a site’s usability.</p>
<p>Poorly proportioned user guide or product images video that’s too stretched to check clearly can affect both a visitor’s want and their ability to use the site. Developers, designers, and anyone working with images will need to know how aspect ratios work and manipulate them for the best visual effect.</p>
<p>Various <strong>pixel calculator ratios</strong>, both paid and free, have popped up on the web to streamline the process.</p>

You’ll see that your photo is like a mosaic formed by small tiles if you zoom in far enough, which are known as pixels in photography.</p>
<p>The amount of these pixels and the way they are divided are the two elements that you’re required to take into account to know more about the resolution and <strong>pixel</strong> <strong>calculator ratio</strong>.</p>
<p>The Pixel Aspect Ratio is simply the latest way of defining the length of one side of a pixel in context to the length of the other.</p>
<p>Let’s say the ratio is 1:1; each side of the pixel is the same length as the other, also known as a square in pixels.</p>
<p>If the ratio is 2:1, it means that one side is twice the length of the other.</p>
<p><strong>NOTE</strong>: The ‘Aspect Ratio’ does not define the actual or exact length of the side of a pixel is, just its “relative” size of one side to the other. The actual length will depend on how much you shrink or stretch a photo when recreating it. But if the <strong>Pixel Calculator Ratio</strong> is 1:1, then the pixels will always be square irrespective of the size of that particular photo.</p>

<p>As the name suggests, the display aspect ratio refers to the proportions of an image as it appears on different screens out there.</p>
<p>Some devices, such as televisions and cameras, have a fixed DAR for images to display nicely on these devices.</p>
<p>They need optimization for their specific or respective aspect ratio. For instance, a typical display aspect ratio for the widescreen video on a television screen or monitor screen is 16:9.</p>
<p>They appear distorted when images with different aspect ratios are presented on these devices. Digital SLR camera sensors also consist of a fixed display aspect ratio, which controls how pictures captured by the camera will be displayed and saved.</p>
<p>3 - <strong>Storage aspect ratio</strong></p>
<p>Storage aspect ratio, commonly known as (SAR) is an aspect ratio formula that concerns specifically to encoded digital video files. SAR refers to the height and the width relationship in video frame size, and it is required to be consistent among all individual frames.</p>
<p>SAR x PAR &#x3D; DAR for max widescreen videos in a usual used formula.</p>

The camera’s fixed aspect ratio can considerably impact, especially for photographers.</p>
<p>And for videographers or anyone working with slideshows, animations, and other motion projects, the aspect ratio is a prominent element for correct display on mobile devices and widescreen.</p>
<p>But even in the environment of responsive web design, problems can arise, such as when an image is not adjustable for display without compromising its quality or content.</p>
<p>A small example is when you need a square image with a 1:1 aspect ratio to insert into a rectangular box on a web page. To accommodate varying image size requirements, proportions and size may need adjustment.</p>
<p>In an increasingly picture-driven digital world, videos and images that look even slightly out of the way add to a visitor’s negative impression of a site. Besides those forced into the wrong configurations can even interfere with a site’s usability.</p>
<p>Poorly proportioned user guide or product images video that’s too stretched to check clearly can affect both a visitor’s want and their ability to use the site. Developers, designers, and anyone working with images will need to know how aspect ratios work and manipulate them for the best visual effect.</p>
<p>Various <strong>pixel calculator ratios</strong>, both paid and free, have popped up on the web to streamline the process.</p>

You’ll see that your photo is like a mosaic formed by small tiles if you zoom in far enough, which are known as pixels in photography.</p>
<p>The amount of these pixels and the way they are divided are the two elements that you’re required to take into account to know more about the resolution and <strong>pixel</strong> <strong>calculator ratio</strong>.</p>
<p>The Pixel Aspect Ratio is simply the latest way of defining the length of one side of a pixel in context to the length of the other.</p>
<p>Let’s say the ratio is 1:1; each side of the pixel is the same length as the other, also known as a square in pixels.</p>
<p>If the ratio is 2:1, it means that one side is twice the length of the other.</p>
<p><strong>NOTE</strong>: The ‘Aspect Ratio’ does not define the actual or exact length of the side of a pixel is, just its “relative” size of one side to the other. The actual length will depend on how much you shrink or stretch a photo when recreating it. But if the <strong>Pixel Calculator Ratio</strong> is 1:1, then the pixels will always be square irrespective of the size of that particular photo.</p>

So, we’d like to suggest a calculator by xwebtools.com.</p>
<p>Here, you can see tabs, namely the <strong>Common Ratios</strong> <strong>Ratio Width</strong>, <strong>Ratio Height</strong>, <strong>Pixels Width</strong>, and <strong>Pixels Height</strong>.</p>

                ></p>
<p><strong>How it works:</strong></p>
<p>This <strong>pixel ratio calculator</strong> converts pixel dimensions to aspect ratios. It is an online free tool that assists you in calculating the aspect ratio value of an object or a photo.</p>
<p>The conversion can be carried in both ways, aspect ratio to pixels and pixels to aspect ratio. This screen resolution calculator offers a powerful and simple tool that can convert the ratio of images to pixels resolution and pixels to ratio dimensions.</p>
<p>You need to provide Pixels Width and Pixels Height to calculate the aspect ratio; the aspect ratio will be automatically calculated.</p>
<p>You need to provide Ratio Height and Ratio Width to calculate pixel resolutions. Both the Pixels Width and Height will get automatically calculated.</p>
<h2 id="Part-3-What-is-Par-pixel-Aspect-Ratio-in-Adobe-Premiere-Pro-Filmora-2"><a href="#Part-3-What-is-Par-pixel-Aspect-Ratio-in-Adobe-Premiere-Pro-Filmora-2" class="headerlink" title="Part 3 What is Par (pixel Aspect Ratio) in Adobe Premiere Pro&#x2F;Filmora?"></a>Part 3 What is Par (pixel Aspect Ratio) in Adobe Premiere Pro&#x2F;Filmora?</h2><p><strong>Pixel ratio: Adobe Premiere Pro</strong></p>
<p>As we already discussed, an aspect ratio defines width to height. The still picture and video frames have a frame aspect ratio. The pixels that create the frame have a pixel aspect ratio (sometimes called PAR).</p>
<p>Different video recording standards have different aspect ratios. For instance, you record video for television in either a 16:9 or a 4:3 frame aspect ratio.</p>
<p>You set the frame and pixel aspect when you create a project in Adobe Premiere Pro. Once you set these ratios, you can’t change them for that project. However, you can edit the aspect ratio of a sequence. You can also use assets made with different aspect ratios in the project.</p>
<p>Premiere Pro automatically compensates for the pixel aspect ratio of source files.</p>
<p>If an asset still feels distorted, you can manually mention its pixel aspect ratio. But that isn’t very clear, especially for a beginner. This is why we recommend doing the following.</p>

<p>1 - <strong>Pixel aspect ratio</strong></p>
<p>Pixel aspect ratio (PAR) is the proportion of the specific pixels within an image. They are generally square within the pixel aspect ratio of 1:1.</p>
<p>But sometimes, specific images are optimized for certain types of displays. And, they have rectangular pixels with an aspect ratio of 4:3 or similar.</p>

<p>Thus, using the Wondershare Filmora along with the <strong>pixel ratio calculator</strong> makes a difference!</p>
<h2 id="Part-4-Difference-among-Pixel-Aspect-Ratio-Display-Aspect-Ratio-and-Storage-Aspect-Ratio-3"><a href="#Part-4-Difference-among-Pixel-Aspect-Ratio-Display-Aspect-Ratio-and-Storage-Aspect-Ratio-3" class="headerlink" title="Part 4 Difference among Pixel Aspect Ratio, Display Aspect Ratio, and Storage Aspect Ratio"></a>Part 4 Difference among Pixel Aspect Ratio, Display Aspect Ratio, and Storage Aspect Ratio</h2><p>Although the image aspect ratio comes from its width and height, it also contains multiple subsets that help to define image proportions properly.</p>
<p>1 - <strong>Pixel aspect ratio</strong></p>
<p>Pixel aspect ratio (PAR) is the proportion of the specific pixels within an image. They are generally square within the pixel aspect ratio of 1:1.</p>
<p>But sometimes, specific images are optimized for certain types of displays. And, they have rectangular pixels with an aspect ratio of 4:3 or similar.</p>
<p>2 - <strong>Display aspect ratio</strong></p>
<p>The display aspect ratio (DAR) is the designers’ most frequent aspect ratio and gets generally synced with the general term.</p>
<p>As the name suggests, the display aspect ratio refers to the proportions of an image as it appears on different screens out there.</p>
<p>Some devices, such as televisions and cameras, have a fixed DAR for images to display nicely on these devices.</p>
<p>They need optimization for their specific or respective aspect ratio. For instance, a typical display aspect ratio for the widescreen video on a television screen or monitor screen is 16:9.</p>
<p>They appear distorted when images with different aspect ratios are presented on these devices. Digital SLR camera sensors also consist of a fixed display aspect ratio, which controls how pictures captured by the camera will be displayed and saved.</p>
<p>3 - <strong>Storage aspect ratio</strong></p>
<p>Storage aspect ratio, commonly known as (SAR) is an aspect ratio formula that concerns specifically to encoded digital video files. SAR refers to the height and the width relationship in video frame size, and it is required to be consistent among all individual frames.</p>
<p>SAR x PAR &#x3D; DAR for max widescreen videos in a usual used formula.</p>
<h2 id="Part-1-Part-5-How-Aspect-Ratios-Affect-UI-UX-Design-3"><a href="#Part-1-Part-5-How-Aspect-Ratios-Affect-UI-UX-Design-3" class="headerlink" title="Part 1 Part 5: How Aspect Ratios Affect UI&#x2F;UX Design?"></a>Part 1 Part 5: How Aspect Ratios Affect UI&#x2F;UX Design?</h2><p>Aspect ratios play a vital part in any project that consists of displaying and capturing photographs, videos, or other image-based files in an ideal manner. The camera’s fixed aspect ratio can considerably impact, especially for photographers.</p>
<p>And for videographers or anyone working with slideshows, animations, and other motion projects, the aspect ratio is a prominent element for correct display on mobile devices and widescreen.</p>
<p>But even in the environment of responsive web design, problems can arise, such as when an image is not adjustable for display without compromising its quality or content.</p>
<p>A small example is when you need a square image with a 1:1 aspect ratio to insert into a rectangular box on a web page. To accommodate varying image size requirements, proportions and size may need adjustment.</p>
<p>In an increasingly picture-driven digital world, videos and images that look even slightly out of the way add to a visitor’s negative impression of a site. Besides those forced into the wrong configurations can even interfere with a site’s usability.</p>
<p>Poorly proportioned user guide or product images video that’s too stretched to check clearly can affect both a visitor’s want and their ability to use the site. Developers, designers, and anyone working with images will need to know how aspect ratios work and manipulate them for the best visual effect.</p>
<p>Various <strong>pixel calculator ratios</strong>, both paid and free, have popped up on the web to streamline the process.</p>

<p>Video content is becoming increasingly popular; with the proliferation of online content, practically every product now needs its mini-documentary or video clip. Experienced filmmakers and VFX artists used to be the only ones who could get smooth footage. Those days, however, are over.</p>
<p>Adobe After Effects is an excellent tool for smoothing out video footage, in addition to being a great blending and motion animation software; although it’s usually preferable to maintain your film as seamless as possible on location, it’s not the end of the world if you take a seat to edit your video and decide it’s too shaky. In truth, there are several options available to you. In After Effects, there are three options for stabilizing footage. What are they – and how to use <strong>After Effects to</strong> <strong>stabilize footage</strong>? Let’s find out!</p>
<h4 id="In-this-article-4"><a href="#In-this-article-4" class="headerlink" title="In this article"></a>In this article</h4><p>01 <a href="#part1">Stabilize Video with Built-in Warp Stabilizer in AE</a></p>
<p>02 <a href="#part2">Stabilize Shaky Video with Track Motion Feature in AE</a></p>
<p>03 <a href="#part3">Using Stabilization Plugins for Smoother Video in AE</a></p>
<h2 id="Part-1-Stabilize-Video-with-Built-in-Warp-Stabilizer-in-AE"><a href="#Part-1-Stabilize-Video-with-Built-in-Warp-Stabilizer-in-AE" class="headerlink" title="Part 1: Stabilize Video with Built-in Warp Stabilizer in AE"></a>Part 1: Stabilize Video with Built-in Warp Stabilizer in AE</h2><p>The Warp Stabilizer effect is a new technique to cope with unsteady video. In this part, I will show you how to apply Warp Stabilizer to a layer, adjust the effect’s essential parameters, and demonstrate how they work briefly.</p>
<p><strong>Step 1:</strong> The Warp Stabilizer is the most excellent built-in choice for After Effects. This may be found under the Distort tools section of the Effects &amp; Presets panel. You may also go to the effects tab and look for “<strong>Warp</strong>“ in the search box.</p>
<p><img  
                     lazyload
                     src="/images/loading.svg"
                     data-src="https://images.wondershare.com/filmora/article-images/after-effects-effects-presets-pane.jpg"
                      alt="after effects effects presets pane"
                ></p>
<p><strong>Step 2:</strong> When you’ve identified <strong>Warp Stabilizer</strong>, you’ll have to add it to the layer you want to stabilize. You may accomplish this in one of three different ways. You may either drag and drop the filter into the chosen layer in the composing window, place it on the desired layer in the timeline, or double-tap on the effect while selecting your choice footage layer.</p>
<p><img  
                     lazyload
                     src="/images/loading.svg"
                     data-src="https://images.wondershare.com/filmora/article-images/after-effects-warp-stabilizer-vfx.jpg"
                      alt="after effects warp stabilizer vfx"
                ></p>
<p><strong>Step 3:</strong> Once you apply the warp stabilizer, it will start immediately. So now, all you have to do is lay back and let the stabilizer do its job.</p>
<p>(Note: The procedure should take no more than a few minutes, and a blue bar will appear across your composition window, indicating that the warp stabilizer is evaluating the film. The composition panel would then display an orange bar, indicating that the effect is applied).</p>
<p><strong>Step 4:</strong> After stabilization, use the spacebar to begin a RAM peek. Choose the layer you added to and click to display the drop-down menu or go to the Effects Control panel whenever you need to tweak the stabilizing effect.</p>
<h2 id="Part-2-Stabilize-Shaky-Video-with-Track-Motion-Feature-in-AE"><a href="#Part-2-Stabilize-Shaky-Video-with-Track-Motion-Feature-in-AE" class="headerlink" title="Part 2: Stabilize Shaky Video with Track Motion Feature in AE"></a>Part 2: Stabilize Shaky Video with Track Motion Feature in AE</h2><p>Using Stabilize Motion feature to stabilize video is an old-school heritage function from the era of the Creative Suite, it will still be there in After Effects presently and performs admirably.</p>
<p><strong>Step 1:</strong> The tracker panel is most likely open by default in your edition of After Effects, but if it isn’t, go to <strong>Window</strong> in the top menu to open it. Once you’ve arrived here, scroll to the bottom until you locate <strong>Tracker</strong> and double-check that it has a checkbox beside it.</p>
<p><img  
                     lazyload
                     src="/images/loading.svg"

                      alt="after effects tracker pane"
                ></p>
<p><strong>Step 2:</strong> Select Stabilize Motion from the drop-down menu whenever the tracker panel is open. You’ll see that a tracker box appears in your <strong>Layer Panel</strong> once you’ve done this.</p>
<p>(<strong>Note</strong>: You’ll need to identify a proper location in your film for the tracker to operate at this stage. We’re monitoring a vehicle using a camera operator’s drone in the instance below).</p>

<p>However, as with any good program, third-party plugins could only help you take your work to the next level by adding new features or streamlining your process.</p>
<p>It should be unsurprising that After Effects has many plugins for a program that is over 30 years old. Here are the best stabilization plugins for smoother video in AE:</p>

It utilizes a similar 3D engine to Video Copilot’s great Element 3D plugin, and it employs a similar 3D engine to Video Copilot’s outstanding Element 3D plugin.</p>
<p>You would believe that making planets in 3D is simple —create a circle, add textures, and you’re done! Getting a world to ‘look’ properly, on the other hand, might be more complicated than it appears.</p>
<p>For example, how can the line between night and day be altered in a model of a populated planet such that cities may be visible at night but not during the day?</p>
<p>Although Orb doesn’t work for every planetary picture, this would function for 90% of them and is a helpful previs tool. This is particularly true when used in conjunction with other After Effects plugins or paired with a 3D lens from a 3D program, which may be brought into After Effects with background plates for things like spacecraft.</p>

<p>You would like to record your film at a more excellent resolution than your expected outcome to get the most out of ReelSteady. If you wish to output your video in 4K, you might capture it in 4.6K or 5K. You’ll have some leeway for ReelSteady to work its magic.</p>
<p>ReelSteady’s sole flaw is its high price ($399). ReelSteady is not available in After Effects, unlike some of the other choices on this list. ReelSteady, on the other hand, is the way to go if you would like the smoothest footage imaginable.</p>
<p><strong>Conclusion</strong></p>
<p>Shaky video footage would be the last thing any video creator wants unless it’s done intentionally for artistic or creative reasons. As a result, they employ methods and equipment to keep the camera safe from any undesired movement.</p>
<p>However, occasionally those tools aren’t available, and the outcome is questionable. That is why we decided to compile this article to add to the knowledge of our readers how they can use <strong>After Effects to</strong> <strong>stabilize videos</strong> to enhance their video content!</p>

<p>Video content is becoming increasingly popular; with the proliferation of online content, practically every product now needs its mini-documentary or video clip. Experienced filmmakers and VFX artists used to be the only ones who could get smooth footage. Those days, however, are over.</p>
<p>Adobe After Effects is an excellent tool for smoothing out video footage, in addition to being a great blending and motion animation software; although it’s usually preferable to maintain your film as seamless as possible on location, it’s not the end of the world if you take a seat to edit your video and decide it’s too shaky. In truth, there are several options available to you. In After Effects, there are three options for stabilizing footage. What are they – and how to use <strong>After Effects to</strong> <strong>stabilize footage</strong>? Let’s find out!</p>

In this part, I will show you how to apply Warp Stabilizer to a layer, adjust the effect’s essential parameters, and demonstrate how they work briefly.</p>
<p><strong>Step 1:</strong> The Warp Stabilizer is the most excellent built-in choice for After Effects. This may be found under the Distort tools section of the Effects &amp; Presets panel. You may also go to the effects tab and look for “<strong>Warp</strong>“ in the search box.</p>
<p><img

                      alt="after effects effects presets pane"
                ></p>
<p><strong>Step 2:</strong> When you’ve identified <strong>Warp Stabilizer</strong>, you’ll have to add it to the layer you want to stabilize. You may accomplish this in one of three different ways. You may either drag and drop the filter into the chosen layer in the composing window, place it on the desired layer in the timeline, or double-tap on the effect while selecting your choice footage layer.</p>
<p><img  
                     lazyload

                      alt="after effects warp stabilizer vfx"
                ></p>
<p><strong>Step 3:</strong> Once you apply the warp stabilizer, it will start immediately. So now, all you have to do is lay back and let the stabilizer do its job.</p>
<p>(Note: The procedure should take no more than a few minutes, and a blue bar will appear across your composition window, indicating that the warp stabilizer is evaluating the film. The composition panel would then display an orange bar, indicating that the effect is applied).</p>
<p><strong>Step 4:</strong> After stabilization, use the spacebar to begin a RAM peek. Choose the layer you added to and click to display the drop-down menu or go to the Effects Control panel whenever you need to tweak the stabilizing effect.</p>
<h2 id="Part-2-Stabilize-Shaky-Video-with-Track-Motion-Feature-in-AE-1"><a href="#Part-2-Stabilize-Shaky-Video-with-Track-Motion-Feature-in-AE-1" class="headerlink" title="Part 2: Stabilize Shaky Video with Track Motion Feature in AE"></a>Part 2: Stabilize Shaky Video with Track Motion Feature in AE</h2><p>Using Stabilize Motion feature to stabilize video is an old-school heritage function from the era of the Creative Suite, it will still be there in After Effects presently and performs admirably.</p>
<p><strong>Step 1:</strong> The tracker panel is most likely open by default in your edition of After Effects, but if it isn’t, go to <strong>Window</strong> in the top menu to open it. Once you’ve arrived here, scroll to the bottom until you locate <strong>Tracker</strong> and double-check that it has a checkbox beside it.</p>

<p><strong>Step 2:</strong> Select Stabilize Motion from the drop-down menu whenever the tracker panel is open. You’ll see that a tracker box appears in your <strong>Layer Panel</strong> once you’ve done this.</p>
<p>(<strong>Note</strong>: You’ll need to identify a proper location in your film for the tracker to operate at this stage. We’re monitoring a vehicle using a camera operator’s drone in the instance below).</p>

Since it can handle so much right out of the box, Adobe After Effects CC is already a go-to motion graphic and compositing program for many artists.</p>
<p>However, as with any good program, third-party plugins could only help you take your work to the next level by adding new features or streamlining your process.</p>
<p>It should be unsurprising that After Effects has many plugins for a program that is over 30 years old. Here are the best stabilization plugins for smoother video in AE:</p>
<h3 id="1-Orb-2"><a href="#1-Orb-2" class="headerlink" title="1.

It utilizes a similar 3D engine to Video Copilot’s great Element 3D plugin, and it employs a similar 3D engine to Video Copilot’s outstanding Element 3D plugin.</p>
<p>You would believe that making planets in 3D is simple —create a circle, add textures, and you’re done! Getting a world to ‘look’ properly, on the other hand, might be more complicated than it appears.</p>
<p>For example, how can the line between night and day be altered in a model of a populated planet such that cities may be visible at night but not during the day?</p>
<p>Although Orb doesn’t work for every planetary picture, this would function for 90% of them and is a helpful previs tool. This is particularly true when used in conjunction with other After Effects plugins or paired with a 3D lens from a 3D program, which may be brought into After Effects with background plates for things like spacecraft.</p>

<p>This is thanks to almost a decade of discovery and application since the first launch in 2005. DOF PRO’s cutting-edge characteristics offer new and advanced technologies not found anywhere else, resulting in one of the industry’s most potent and sophisticated depth of field processors.</p>

<p>You would like to record your film at a more excellent resolution than your expected outcome to get the most out of ReelSteady. If you wish to output your video in 4K, you might capture it in 4.6K or 5K. You’ll have some leeway for ReelSteady to work its magic.</p>
<p>ReelSteady’s sole flaw is its high price ($399). ReelSteady is not available in After Effects, unlike some of the other choices on this list. ReelSteady, on the other hand, is the way to go if you would like the smoothest footage imaginable.</p>
<p><strong>Conclusion</strong></p>
<p>Shaky video footage would be the last thing any video creator wants unless it’s done intentionally for artistic or creative reasons. As a result, they employ methods and equipment to keep the camera safe from any undesired movement.</p>
<p>However, occasionally those tools aren’t available, and the outcome is questionable. That is why we decided to compile this article to add to the knowledge of our readers how they can use <strong>After Effects to</strong> <strong>stabilize videos</strong> to enhance their video content!</p>

<p>Video content is becoming increasingly popular; with the proliferation of online content, practically every product now needs its mini-documentary or video clip. Experienced filmmakers and VFX artists used to be the only ones who could get smooth footage. Those days, however, are over.</p>
<p>Adobe After Effects is an excellent tool for smoothing out video footage, in addition to being a great blending and motion animation software; although it’s usually preferable to maintain your film as seamless as possible on location, it’s not the end of the world if you take a seat to edit your video and decide it’s too shaky. In truth, there are several options available to you. In After Effects, there are three options for stabilizing footage. What are they – and how to use <strong>After Effects to</strong> <strong>stabilize footage</strong>? Let’s find out!</p>

<h2 id="Part-1-Stabilize-Video-with-Built-in-Warp-Stabilizer-in-AE-3"><a href="#Part-1-Stabilize-Video-with-Built-in-Warp-Stabilizer-in-AE-3" class="headerlink" title="Part 1: Stabilize Video with Built-in Warp Stabilizer in AE"></a>Part 1: Stabilize Video with Built-in Warp Stabilizer in AE</h2><p>The Warp Stabilizer effect is a new technique to cope with unsteady video. In this part, I will show you how to apply Warp Stabilizer to a layer, adjust the effect’s essential parameters, and demonstrate how they work briefly.</p>
<p><strong>Step 1:</strong> The Warp Stabilizer is the most excellent built-in choice for After Effects. This may be found under the Distort tools section of the Effects &amp; Presets panel. You may also go to the effects tab and look for “<strong>Warp</strong>“ in the search box.</p>
<p><img  
                     lazyload
                     src="/images/loading.svg"
                     data-src="https://images.wondershare.com/filmora/article-images/after-effects-effects-presets-pane.jpg"
                      alt="after effects effects presets pane"
                ></p>
<p><strong>Step 2:</strong> When you’ve identified <strong>Warp Stabilizer</strong>, you’ll have to add it to the layer you want to stabilize. You may accomplish this in one of three different ways. You may either drag and drop the filter into the chosen layer in the composing window, place it on the desired layer in the timeline, or double-tap on the effect while selecting your choice footage layer.</p>
<p><img  
                     lazyload
                     src="/images/loading.svg"
                     data-src="https://images.wondershare.com/filmora/article-images/after-effects-warp-stabilizer-vfx.jpg"
                      alt="after effects warp stabilizer vfx"
                ></p>
<p><strong>Step 3:</strong> Once you apply the warp stabilizer, it will start immediately. So now, all you have to do is lay back and let the stabilizer do its job.</p>
<p>(Note: The procedure should take no more than a few minutes, and a blue bar will appear across your composition window, indicating that the warp stabilizer is evaluating the film. The composition panel would then display an orange bar, indicating that the effect is applied).</p>
<p><strong>Step 4:</strong> After stabilization, use the spacebar to begin a RAM peek. Choose the layer you added to and click to display the drop-down menu or go to the Effects Control panel whenever you need to tweak the stabilizing effect.</p>
<h2 id="Part-2-Stabilize-Shaky-Video-with-Track-Motion-Feature-in-AE-3"><a href="#Part-2-Stabilize-Shaky-Video-with-Track-Motion-Feature-in-AE-3" class="headerlink" title="Part 2: Stabilize Shaky Video with Track Motion Feature in AE"></a>Part 2: Stabilize Shaky Video with Track Motion Feature in AE</h2><p>Using Stabilize Motion feature to stabilize video is an old-school heritage function from the era of the Creative Suite, it will still be there in After Effects presently and performs admirably.</p>
<p><strong>Step 1:</strong> The tracker panel is most likely open by default in your edition of After Effects, but if it isn’t, go to <strong>Window</strong> in the top menu to open it. Once you’ve arrived here, scroll to the bottom until you locate <strong>Tracker</strong> and double-check that it has a checkbox beside it.</p>
<p><img  
                     lazyload
                     src="/images/loading.svg"

                      alt="after effects tracker pane"
                ></p>
<p><strong>Step 2:</strong> Select Stabilize Motion from the drop-down menu whenever the tracker panel is open. You’ll see that a tracker box appears in your <strong>Layer Panel</strong> once you’ve done this.</p>
<p>(<strong>Note</strong>: You’ll need to identify a proper location in your film for the tracker to operate at this stage. We’re monitoring a vehicle using a camera operator’s drone in the instance below).</p>

<h2 id="Importing"><a href="#Importing" class="headerlink" title="Importing"></a>Importing</h2><p>There are two main ways to import media into Premiere, the import command and the media browser. They do things slightly differently and have uses they are both best suited to, here we will look at the process itself and which method to use in a given situation.</p>
<h4 id="1-Import-Command"><a href="#1-Import-Command" class="headerlink" title="1.  Import Command"></a>1.  Import Command</h4><p>This is a straightforward command that works like most other programs, and is accessed from the file menu, or via the Control+I shortcut on the PC or Command+I on the Mac. You can also double click an empty area of the project panel to automatically open the import dialogue.</p>
<p>Whichever way you access it, you get the standard for the platform import dialogue box we see here.</p>

                      alt="Import videos to Adobe Premiere"
                ></p>
<p>This method of importing is best suited to self-contained media such as audio or graphics, or video files such as MP4 that are single files themselves, whose location on your computer you know so you can navigate to them easily. This is not the way to import videos from cameras, as they invariably create complex file and folder arrangements that make choosing the correct files difficult. This is where you would opt for the media browser method instead.</p>
<h4 id="2-Media-Browser"><a href="#2-Media-Browser" class="headerlink" title="2.  Media Browser"></a>2.  Media Browser</h4><p>Whilst on the surface media browser appears to do the same job as the import command the way they carry out the task is somewhat different, media browser is designed to let you see the media created by cameras, and show you easy to understand icons and metadata rather than the intricate pattern of files and folders they use. This makes picking the correct clip from a selection much easier, with metadata showing you date and duration as well as file type.</p>
<p><img

                     src="/images/loading.svg"

                      alt="Import videos to Adobe Premiere"
                ></p>
<p>The media browser panel is found in the project panel, which on the standard layout is the bottom left corner, and can also be accessed by the Shift+8 shortcut. As you can see from the screenshot it works like an operating system file browser and allows you to navigate through the file directories of hard drives and removable media connected to the system.</p>
<p>One of the benefits of media browser is to narrow down the type of media being shown, so you can set to avchd for instance and it will display just that type of file in a given location. Because many projects use media from different sources this can be a real boon to finding the right file within a list.</p>
<h4 id="File-Types"><a href="#File-Types" class="headerlink" title="File Types"></a>File Types</h4><p>Media browser displays more or less any file there is in a given location, and importing is simply a matter of selecting the correct file and double clicking it or right clicking and selecting import from the menu. You can select multiple files at once by holding down shift and import them all together if needed.</p>
<p>There are some exceptions to this, however, despite having a huge number of file types supported natively within Premiere, you will sometimes run into files that are not supported, FLV and MKV files being the most common ones, but this is not the end of the world and there is a simple solution.</p>
<p><a class="link"   target="_blank" rel="noopener" href="https://tools.techidaily.com/wondershare/videoconverter/download/" >Wondershare Video Converter Ultimate <i class="fa-regular fa-arrow-up-right-from-square fa-sm"></i></a> offers an easy way to convert any file you may have into media that Premiere can use quickly and efficiently, and is a great tool to have alongside premiere if you commonly work with multiple file types.</p>
<h2 id="Exporting"><a href="#Exporting" class="headerlink" title="Exporting"></a>Exporting</h2><p>The ultimate aim of any project is obviously to finish it and let others see the result of your creativity, and that means exporting your work into a format that is suitable for the medium you wish the project to be viewed on. Premiere offers a number of options regarding export, you can select an entire sequence to export as a single file for the web or disc, choose a single frame to post to a website, blog or to distribute through email, you can export just the audio, or just the video from a sequence, and if you have the right hardware, can export directly to tape or disk.</p>
<p>To export a project that closely matches the original media in quality and frame rates, often called a master copy, is very straightforward in Premiere, with the sequence selected, either in the Timeline Panel or the Project Panel, you simply use the File &gt; Export &gt; Media path :</p>
<p><img  
                     lazyload
                     src="/images/loading.svg"
                     data-src="https://images.wondershare.com/images/multimedia/video-editor/import-export-3.jpg"
                      alt="Export videos in Adobe Premiere"
                ></p>
<p>Which opens the media export dialogue.</p>
<p><img  
                     lazyload
                     src="/images/loading.svg"
                     data-src="https://images.wondershare.com/images/multimedia/video-editor/import-export-4.jpg"
                      alt="Export videos in Adobe Premiere"
                ></p>
<p>Selecting ‘Match Sequence Settings’ here creates a finished file that matches the quality of the original source media. Then you simply choose a suitable name for the file in the Output Name field, and click export. This creates in essence a digital clone of the sequence, and best practice is to always do this for any project, however, for many projects, this is not necessarily the format you would want the final product to be in, those concentrating on YouTube output, or someone wanting to author a DVD for instance will need other options.</p>
<p>Thankfully Premiere caters here as well. Instead of selecting the ‘Match Sequence Settings’ within export dialogue, you can click on the ‘Format’ field to change the type of file that is produced. What options here can vary depending on codecs installed, this screenshot shows only those that are included with the product for clarity.</p>
<p><img  
                     lazyload
                     src="/images/loading.svg"
                     data-src="https://images.wondershare.com/images/multimedia/video-editor/import-export-5.jpg"
                      alt="Export videos in Adobe Premiere"
                ></p>
<p>Depending on which format you choose. The preset below will allow you to choose a wide range of output settings to suit the intended platform. For instance, selecting  format brings up a huge number of presets for various Tablets and Phones, but also for Vimeo and YouTube, which is why it is one of the most common output formats. Here’s a look at some of the presets available from the menu.</p>
<p><img  
                     lazyload
                     src="/images/loading.svg"
                     data-src="https://images.wondershare.com/images/multimedia/video-editor/import-export-6.jpg"
                      alt="Export videos in Adobe Premiere"
                ></p>
<p>Once you choose a preset, you can further modify the parameters to suit the project you are working on and even save those as an additional custom preset for later projects should you wish. Again, choosing a suitable file name and clicking Export ends the process.</p>
<p>The other common requirement is for DVD or Blu-Ray files. Whilst you need access to the appropriate hardware to burn the disk, Premiere creates the file structure for that natively and you have two options here. Mpeg2 in either DVD or Blu-Ray form, or  Blu-Ray. With high quality source material, the two formats are virtually indistinguishable in their final format, however, MPEG2 will be much quicker to render and is a good choice for most applications. Although  does allow more content to fit into a given space, so it does have uses. Importing and exporting are the foundation of Premiere use, and as we have shown Premiere makes it very easy to do and produces the right file types for whatever your project is to be used for.</p>

<h2 id="Importing-1"><a href="#Importing-1" class="headerlink" title="Importing"></a>Importing</h2><p>There are two main ways to import media into Premiere, the import command and the media browser. They do things slightly differently and have uses they are both best suited to, here we will look at the process itself and which method to use in a given situation.</p>
<h4 id="1-Import-Command-1"><a href="#1-Import-Command-1" class="headerlink" title="1.  Import Command"></a>1.  Import Command</h4><p>This is a straightforward command that works like most other programs, and is accessed from the file menu, or via the Control+I shortcut on the PC or Command+I on the Mac. You can also double click an empty area of the project panel to automatically open the import dialogue.</p>
<p>Whichever way you access it, you get the standard for the platform import dialogue box we see here.</p>
<p><img

                ></p>
<p>This method of importing is best suited to self-contained media such as audio or graphics, or video files such as MP4 that are single files themselves, whose location on your computer you know so you can navigate to them easily. This is not the way to import videos from cameras, as they invariably create complex file and folder arrangements that make choosing the correct files difficult. This is where you would opt for the media browser method instead.</p>
<h4 id="2-Media-Browser-1"><a href="#2-Media-Browser-1" class="headerlink" title="2.  Media Browser"></a>2.

<p>To export a project that closely matches the original media in quality and frame rates, often called a master copy, is very straightforward in Premiere, with the sequence selected, either in the Timeline Panel or the Project Panel, you simply use the File &gt; Export &gt; Media path :</p>

                     src="/images/loading.svg"
                     data-src="https://images.wondershare.com/images/multimedia/video-editor/import-export-3.jpg"
                      alt="Export videos in Adobe Premiere"
                ></p>
<p>Which opens the media export dialogue.</p>
<p><img  
                     lazyload
                     src="/images/loading.svg"
                     data-src="https://images.wondershare.com/images/multimedia/video-editor/import-export-4.jpg"
                      alt="Export videos in Adobe Premiere"
                ></p>
<p>Selecting ‘Match Sequence Settings’ here creates a finished file that matches the quality of the original source media. Then you simply choose a suitable name for the file in the Output Name field, and click export. This creates in essence a digital clone of the sequence, and best practice is to always do this for any project, however, for many projects, this is not necessarily the format you would want the final product to be in, those concentrating on YouTube output, or someone wanting to author a DVD for instance will need other options.</p>
<p>Thankfully Premiere caters here as well. Instead of selecting the ‘Match Sequence Settings’ within export dialogue, you can click on the ‘Format’ field to change the type of file that is produced. What options here can vary depending on codecs installed, this screenshot shows only those that are included with the product for clarity.</p>
<p><img  
                     lazyload
                     src="/images/loading.svg"
                     data-src="https://images.wondershare.com/images/multimedia/video-editor/import-export-5.jpg"
                      alt="Export videos in Adobe Premiere"
                ></p>
<p>Depending on which format you choose. The preset below will allow you to choose a wide range of output settings to suit the intended platform. For instance, selecting  format brings up a huge number of presets for various Tablets and Phones, but also for Vimeo and YouTube, which is why it is one of the most common output formats. Here’s a look at some of the presets available from the menu.</p>
<p><img  
                     lazyload
                     src="/images/loading.svg"
                     data-src="https://images.wondershare.com/images/multimedia/video-editor/import-export-6.jpg"
                      alt="Export videos in Adobe Premiere"
                ></p>
<p>Once you choose a preset, you can further modify the parameters to suit the project you are working on and even save those as an additional custom preset for later projects should you wish. Again, choosing a suitable file name and clicking Export ends the process.</p>
<p>The other common requirement is for DVD or Blu-Ray files. Whilst you need access to the appropriate hardware to burn the disk, Premiere creates the file structure for that natively and you have two options here. Mpeg2 in either DVD or Blu-Ray form, or  Blu-Ray. With high quality source material, the two formats are virtually indistinguishable in their final format, however, MPEG2 will be much quicker to render and is a good choice for most applications. Although  does allow more content to fit into a given space, so it does have uses. Importing and exporting are the foundation of Premiere use, and as we have shown Premiere makes it very easy to do and produces the right file types for whatever your project is to be used for.</p>

<h2 id="Importing-3"><a href="#Importing-3" class="headerlink" title="Importing"></a>Importing</h2><p>There are two main ways to import media into Premiere, the import command and the media browser. They do things slightly differently and have uses they are both best suited to, here we will look at the process itself and which method to use in a given situation.</p>
<h4 id="1-Import-Command-3"><a href="#1-Import-Command-3" class="headerlink" title="1.  Import Command"></a>1.  Import Command</h4><p>This is a straightforward command that works like most other programs, and is accessed from the file menu, or via the Control+I shortcut on the PC or Command+I on the Mac. You can also double click an empty area of the project panel to automatically open the import dialogue.</p>
<p>Whichever way you access it, you get the standard for the platform import dialogue box we see here.</p>
<p><img  
                     lazyload
                     src="/images/loading.svg"
                     data-src="https://images.wondershare.com/images/multimedia/video-editor/import-export-1.jpg"
                      alt="Import videos to Adobe Premiere"
                ></p>
<p>This method of importing is best suited to self-contained media such as audio or graphics, or video files such as MP4 that are single files themselves, whose location on your computer you know so you can navigate to them easily. This is not the way to import videos from cameras, as they invariably create complex file and folder arrangements that make choosing the correct files difficult. This is where you would opt for the media browser method instead.</p>
<h4 id="2-Media-Browser-3"><a href="#2-Media-Browser-3" class="headerlink" title="2.  Media Browser"></a>2.  Media Browser</h4><p>Whilst on the surface media browser appears to do the same job as the import command the way they carry out the task is somewhat different, media browser is designed to let you see the media created by cameras, and show you easy to understand icons and metadata rather than the intricate pattern of files and folders they use. This makes picking the correct clip from a selection much easier, with metadata showing you date and duration as well as file type.</p>
<p><img  
                     lazyload
                     src="/images/loading.svg"
                     data-src="https://images.wondershare.com/images/multimedia/video-editor/import-export-2.jpg"
                      alt="Import videos to Adobe Premiere"
                ></p>
<p>The media browser panel is found in the project panel, which on the standard layout is the bottom left corner, and can also be accessed by the Shift+8 shortcut. As you can see from the screenshot it works like an operating system file browser and allows you to navigate through the file directories of hard drives and removable media connected to the system.</p>
<p>One of the benefits of media browser is to narrow down the type of media being shown, so you can set to avchd for instance and it will display just that type of file in a given location. Because many projects use media from different sources this can be a real boon to finding the right file within a list.</p>
<h4 id="File-Types-3"><a href="#File-Types-3" class="headerlink" title="File Types"></a>File Types</h4><p>Media browser displays more or less any file there is in a given location, and importing is simply a matter of selecting the correct file and double clicking it or right clicking and selecting import from the menu. You can select multiple files at once by holding down shift and import them all together if needed.</p>
<p>There are some exceptions to this, however, despite having a huge number of file types supported natively within Premiere, you will sometimes run into files that are not supported, FLV and MKV files being the most common ones, but this is not the end of the world and there is a simple solution.</p>
<p><a class="link"   target="_blank" rel="noopener" href="https://tools.techidaily.com/wondershare/videoconverter/download/" >Wondershare Video Converter Ultimate <i class="fa-regular fa-arrow-up-right-from-square fa-sm"></i></a> offers an easy way to convert any file you may have into media that Premiere can use quickly and efficiently, and is a great tool to have alongside premiere if you commonly work with multiple file types.</p>
<h2 id="Exporting-3"><a href="#Exporting-3" class="headerlink" title="Exporting"></a>Exporting</h2><p>The ultimate aim of any project is obviously to finish it and let others see the result of your creativity, and that means exporting your work into a format that is suitable for the medium you wish the project to be viewed on.

                      alt="Export videos in Adobe Premiere"
                ></p>
<p>Which opens the media export dialogue.</p>
<p><img  
                     lazyload
                     src="/images/loading.svg"
