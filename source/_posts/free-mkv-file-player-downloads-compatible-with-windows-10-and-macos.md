### What is MKV Codec?

Like [MP4 codec](https://tools.techidaily.com/5kplayer/video-music-player/), MKV is a container format that can contain various video and audio codecs for media playback, so the codec that can be used to encode and decode MKV file can be classified into MKV codec. MKV codecs are variable including common H.264 (AVC ; MPEG 4 Part 10), DivX Video, XviD Video, AAC Audio, Ogg Vorbis audio, Multichannel (5.1 surround) audio, Dolby AC3 audio, MP3 audio, MPEG4V1/2/3 video, and rare Realvideo, Realaudio, RV 9, RV 10 and ON2 (VP4, VP5, VP6).

Therefore, if your media player doesn't include the specific MKV codec like H.264, it will fail to decode the MKV files. MKV codec pack is the key factor to decode MKV files, that's why we need to download MKV codec pack for Windows 10 or Mac when MKV not playing error happens.

### Which Media Player Needs to Download MKV Codec Pack?

**1\. QuickTime Player:** Often the case, you will get an error message "Error-2048: the file is not a movie file" or something like that when trying to play MKV with QuickTime player, as QuickTime does not natively support MKV files. To make MKV videos playable in QuickTime, you may need to download MKV codec pack Mac for QuickTime.

**2\. Windows Media Player:** Though Windows 10 has claimed to support MKV codec, we still can't play MKV in Windows Media Player as WMP is not a real [MKV video player](https://tools.techidaily.com/5kplayer/video-music-player/). WMV (Windows Media Video) is actually the native video format that WMP supports and Microsoft like to promote to turn against other non-Windows media formats like MKV. So, MKV codec download for Windows Media Player is needed.

**3\. VLC Media Player:** Though VLC media player is very popular, it is not almighty. As VLC only supports MPEG-2, MPEG-4, MPEG-4 ASP, H.264, DivX 4/5/6, XviD, SV1, 3ivX D4 and H.264/MPEG-4 AVC codecs as of now, you need external MKV codec pack to strengthen it and help solve [VLC can't play MKV](https://tools.techidaily.com/5kplayer/video-music-player/) problem.

Besides the top three media players for Mac or Windows 10, other third-party media players like KMPlayer may also lack MKV codecs to decode MKV files. If your media player is encountering such a problem, you are highly suggested to download MKV codecs.

### Is MKV Codec Better than MKV Player for MKV Playback?

**MKV codec indeed has some shortcomings:** MKV codec is necessary for MKV playback but that doesn't mean we need to install external MKV codecs for those codecs are not that perfect. Third-party MKV codec pack from unknown sites may contain virus, adware or spyware that may conflict with your programs and even corrupt your operating system of computer. Besides, the newly-downloaded MKV codecs may conflict with the existed codecs on your comouter. If you have spent time learning the codec pack, you will find that third-party MKV codec pack doesn't update for a very long time, for example the CCCP codec pack last updated in 2015, so the quite old MKV codecs maybe not suitable for your media player. Worse still, there seems no good site to offer MKV codec pack for Mac computer.
