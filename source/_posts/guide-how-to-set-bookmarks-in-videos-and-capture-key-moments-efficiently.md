### Other Bookmark Video Players Free Download

Besides 5KPlayer, there are also many other well-known media players that own the ability. BTW, including 5KPlayer, all of them allow you to restart the playback where you left off last time with a resume playback feature.

**1\. PotPlayer**  
**How to:** Open a video with PotPlayer > right-click on the video and choose Playback > Chapter/Bookmark > Add Bookmark.   
**Cons:** You can’t add any descriptions to your bookmarks.
