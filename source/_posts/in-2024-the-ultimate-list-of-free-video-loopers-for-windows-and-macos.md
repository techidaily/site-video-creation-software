## Part 1: Best Video Loopers to Loop Videos for Free on Windows and Mac

Whatever you are motivated to create a video loop, you should know that it's a straightforward process. If you wish to create a looping video, you'll need to download a video editing tool. Here we will cover the best free video looper for you and how you can create a loop video.

### 1\. [Window Media Player](https://support.microsoft.com/en-us/windows/get-windows-media-player-81718e0d-cfce-25b1-aee3-94596b658287)

Windows Media Player offers a clean and intuitive interface, outstanding performance, particularly with big media libraries, and solid integration with Urge, the company's de facto music streaming service. Whenever Windows Media Player approaches the finish of a video, it gives you the option to repeat it manually, but it does not do it routinely.

Enabling the Repeat function, on the other hand, directs Media Player to play the video in a constant loop until you actively stop it or shut the software. Looping a video impacts the rest of the video from start to finish; Media Player does not only allow you to loop a portion of it but more.

**How to Loop Video in Windows Media Player?**

**Step 1:** Drag your mouse pointer over the Media Player window in **Now Playing** status to reveal the _playback settings_.

**Step 2:** To continually repeat the movie, click the **Turn Repeat On** button, denoted by a circular arrow, and glows blue when toggled on.

(**Note:** If you don't see this button in a tiny playing window, select the square **Maximize** symbol or drag the video corners to expand the window bigger).

**Step 3:** Until you exit the application or click the **Turn Repeat Off** icon, the Repeat option will repeat the whole video.

![play video in loop windows media player](https://images.wondershare.com/filmora/article-images/play-video-in-loop-windows-media-player.jpg)

Using QuickTime, you may cut the length of video clips or merge many pieces into a single film.

## Part 1: Best Video Loopers to Loop Videos for Free on Windows and Mac

Whatever you are motivated to create a video loop, you should know that it's a straightforward process. If you wish to create a looping video, you'll need to download a video editing tool. Here we will cover the best free video looper for you and how you can create a loop video.

### 1\. [Window Media Player](https://support.microsoft.com/en-us/windows/get-windows-media-player-81718e0d-cfce-25b1-aee3-94596b658287)

Windows Media Player offers a clean and intuitive interface, outstanding performance, particularly with big media libraries, and solid integration with Urge, the company's de facto music streaming service. Whenever Windows Media Player approaches the finish of a video, it gives you the option to repeat it manually, but it does not do it routinely.

Enabling the Repeat function, on the other hand, directs Media Player to play the video in a constant loop until you actively stop it or shut the software. Looping a video impacts the rest of the video from start to finish; Media Player does not only allow you to loop a portion of it but more.

**How to Loop Video in Windows Media Player?**

**Step 1:** Drag your mouse pointer over the Media Player window in **Now Playing** status to reveal the _playback settings_.

**Step 2:** To continually repeat the movie, click the **Turn Repeat On** button, denoted by a circular arrow, and glows blue when toggled on.

(**Note:** If you don't see this button in a tiny playing window, select the square **Maximize** symbol or drag the video corners to expand the window bigger).

**Step 3:** Until you exit the application or click the **Turn Repeat Off** icon, the Repeat option will repeat the whole video.

![play video in loop windows media player](https://images.wondershare.com/filmora/article-images/play-video-in-loop-windows-media-player.jpg)

 **Note:** When you close the window, your prior feature selection is retained; thus, the next video you watch will play in a loop until you turn off the **Repeat** feature.

### 2\. [QuickTime Player](https://support.apple.com/downloads/quicktime)

QuickTime Player is a basic application that allows you to watch videos and record screencasts on your Mac. You may also produce your videos and audio recordings and do rapid changes. Basic activities such as video flipping and clip splitting are included in edits.

You can record a screencast of a lecture, or capture a portion of the screen with QuickTime, which is ideal for creating a video lesson for an application. Using QuickTime, you may cut the length of video clips or merge many pieces into a single film. Drag the clips to a film window - QuickTime dynamically scales or trims them to fit the size of the movie.

It can also play your video on loop. Here's how:

**How to Loop Video with QuickTime Player?**

If you're using a Mac and wish to generate a video loop in QuickTime Player, follow these steps:

**Step 1:** Launch the **QuickTime** player to watch any video.

**Step 2**: In the taskbar at the top right of the screen, select **View**.

**Step 3:** From the drop-down option, select **Loop**. And that's it. You have put a video on loop.

![loop video quicktime player](https://images.wondershare.com/filmora/article-images/loop-video-quicktime-player.jpg)

These two video programs simplify setting up videos to run on repeat; they don't allow you to loop individual video parts. To do so, you'll need more powerful software, such as the well-known VLC Media Player.

### 3\. [VLC Media Player](https://www.videolan.org/vlc/)

The VLC media player is a program that allows you to play video and music files on your computer. The VLC player can operate on several operating systems, including Windows 2021, XP, and Mac OS X, because of the device's powerful CPUs.

This makes the VLC Media Player an excellent alternative for anybody searching for a media player that can simultaneously run many programs. This free video editing program also includes special capabilities that allow it to execute numerous jobs simultaneously, including video editing, data transmission, graphic display, sound editing, and much more.

 **How to Loop a part of the Video in VLC Media Player Continuously?**

Create a beginning point A and an ending point B, which are in the center of VLC's timeline. There is a control button for the A to B looping function in the Advanced Controls. The starting and ending positions inside a media file can be specified by bringing up the advanced controls first. Now follow these steps to put a video on loop in the VLC media player:

**Step 1:** Open the video with VLC media player. Go to **View**. Select the **Advanced Controls** option.

![vlc media player advanced controls option](https://images.wondershare.com/filmora/article-images/vlc-media-player-advanced-controls-option.jpg)

**Step 2**: Go to the bottom of the VLC media player, and you will find 4 controls above the play button. Click the third button **Loop from Piont A to Point B continuously** to mark the starting point of the loop; and then click the third button again to mark the end of the loop.

![vlc media player loop part of video](https://images.wondershare.com/filmora/article-images/vlc-media-player-loop-part-of-video.jpg)

**Step 3:** Click the Play button and you will find the video is playing loop. Until you press the Loop from point A to point B option for the third time to discontinue the looped playback, the segment of the clip you've put up will keep on playing on loop.

### 4\. [iMovie](https://www.apple.com/imovie/)

iMovie is a fantastic tool for making beautiful short films, music videos, picture slideshows, and other creative projects. You may also loop videos straight in the iMovie software; however, you'll need to utilize QuickTime to loop movies continually if you want to export them. Here are the quick and easy ways to loop a movie into iMovie.

**How to Loop Video in iMovie?**

**Step 1: Open** iMovie and then the video clip you want to loop in.

**Step 2**: Select the **Loop Playback** option from the **View** menu. Once the video begins to play, it will loop indefinitely until you stop it.

### 5\. [Windows Photos App](https://www.microsoft.com/en-us/p/microsoft-photos/9wzdncrfjbh4)

Microsoft Photos, a free photo viewer and editor bundled with Windows 10, provides capable image editing and photo improvements and capabilities for organizing and editing movies, all in a touch-friendly interface.

You may doodle on photographs, [apply background music](https://tools.techidaily.com/wondershare/filmora/download/) and [3D effects to videos](https://tools.techidaily.com/wondershare/filmora/download/), and use automated object tagging to make searching easier. Microsoft Photos is a wonderful tool for dealing with digital photographs, and for certain users, it may even replace third-party photo applications.

**How to Loop Video in Windows 10 Photos app?**

Windows 10 comes with the Photos app preinstalled. It can also assist you in making your movie loop. Here's how to do it.

**Step 1:** Import your video to the Photos app, and use the trim tool to get the part you want to loop.

![trim video windows 10 photos](https://images.wondershare.com/filmora/article-images/trim-video-windows-10-photos.jpg)

**Step 2:** Copy and paste the trimmed video to the storyboard as many times as you like. And then click the Finish Video button to export the video.

![windows 10 photos finish video export](https://images.wondershare.com/filmora/article-images/windows-10-photos-finish-video-export.jpg)

## Part 2: Create Boomerang Loop with [Wondershare Filmora Video Editor](https://tools.techidaily.com/wondershare/filmora/download/)

Suppose you have recorded a cinematic video of a beach in the evening visualizing the sunset and a few birds flying in the sky. Everything looks perfect except the audio, which seems to be fluctuating and breaking at some points. How would you address this challenge?

The best solution to this problem is adding sound effects, which can make your video more interesting and adorable. Setting the frequency of audio with on-screen visuals will invoke the viewers’ emotions and attach them to the scene.

Read this article to learn how to add sound effects to your video with Final Cut Pro.

![SoundEffect](https://images.wondershare.com/filmora/images/final-cut-pro/SoundEffect.jpg)

## Part 1: What are Different Types of Sound Effects?

Sound effects have four major types:

1. **Ambiance SFX**

These sounds fill the screen space to create a virtual sense of an environment or location such as the clattering sound of dishes in a restaurant or the sound of engines on a highway.

1. **Foley SFX**

A mixture of live performance and digital sound editing, these sounds are produced by the artists of Foley studio to match their sounds to the on-screen visuals.

1. **Hard and Soft SFX**

Hard SFX synchronizes a visual to what’s happening in the picture while SFX indicates the location to the audience.

1. **Electronic SFX**

These sounds are generated by instruments that create electronic-sounding effects like electronic keyboards, synthesizers, or plug-ins.

## Part 2: How to Add Sound Effects in Final Cut Pro?

Cinematographic productions need well-balanced music and sound effects. Luckily, **Final Cut Pro comes with** built-in audio enhancement features and third-party Audio Units (AU) effects that allow users to add sound effects to their videos and manage all audio processing tasks.

You can add sound effects in your video with Final Cut Pro. Wonder how? Follow these steps:

**Step 1: Open Photos and Audio Sound Bar**

* In the top-left corner, there is a **Photos and Audio** Click on this button as shown in the figure below:

## Part 5: Extensive Reading: What are Sound Effects and Why are they Important?

Sound is the most important aspect of video editing that engages audiences, evokes emotional responses, and connects people to what they’re seeing. A melodious sound helps the video editors deliver information and creatively and define the tone of their narrative.

Sound effects (SFX) refer to audio clips or sounds that are not part of the recoded video. They are added to movies, documentaries, video games, and even reality shows to invoke the viewers’ emotions and increase their interest in the video.

Similarly, the addition of sound effects increases the production value and creates a complete audience experience. If you want to elevate your video dramatically and make it magnetic, have to balance sound effects, silence, and music in such a way that they support each visual and every cut. Although audio cannot fix slipshod editing or amateur camera work, it becomes more crucial than video quality while you are trying to deliver a specific message in your video.

Professional video editors and filmmakers consider sound effects crucial to their video quality. A clear, melodious, and well-balanced audio adds depth to the visuals, evokes more emotions than the picture, and paints the audio picture of a particular setting.

Even silence, a powerful tool of the audio arsenal, speaks louder than the picture itself. Hence, balancing audio by adding sound effects can make your video stimulating, captivating, and emotional.

That's why a good editing tool always stocks a great number of sound effects for users, like **Filmora**. Click to download and take a look at all the effects in Filmora![](https://tools.techidaily.com/wondershare/filmora/download/)

**Conclusion**

Sound effects are external audio files added to the videos to make them look interesting and worth watching. A perfect balance of sound, music, and silence allows the filmmakers to define the tone of their narrative and deliver their message creatively.

You can create sound effects through self-recording or by downloading them from external resources. To add sound effects to your video, use professional video-editing software like Final Cut Pro or Filmora. Both these applications are user-friendly and possess a huge library of a variety of sound effects and music files. Besides, their advanced features allow you to naturally add sound effects without affecting the video quality.

That's why a good editing tool always stocks a great number of sound effects for users, like **Filmora**. Click to download and take a look at all the effects in Filmora![](https://tools.techidaily.com/wondershare/filmora/download/)

**Conclusion**

Sound effects are external audio files added to the videos to make them look interesting and worth watching. A perfect balance of sound, music, and silence allows the filmmakers to define the tone of their narrative and deliver their message creatively.

You can create sound effects through self-recording or by downloading them from external resources. To add sound effects to your video, use professional video-editing software like Final Cut Pro or Filmora. Both these applications are user-friendly and possess a huge library of a variety of sound effects and music files.

Suppose you have recorded a cinematic video of a beach in the evening visualizing the sunset and a few birds flying in the sky. Everything looks perfect except the audio, which seems to be fluctuating and breaking at some points. How would you address this challenge?

The best solution to this problem is adding sound effects, which can make your video more interesting and adorable. Setting the frequency of audio with on-screen visuals will invoke the viewers’ emotions and attach them to the scene.

Read this article to learn how to add sound effects to your video with Final Cut Pro.

![SoundEffect](https://images.wondershare.com/filmora/images/final-cut-pro/SoundEffect.jpg)

## Part 1: What are Different Types of Sound Effects?

Sound effects have four major types:

1. **Ambiance SFX**

These sounds fill the screen space to create a virtual sense of an environment or location such as the clattering sound of dishes in a restaurant or the sound of engines on a highway.

1. **Foley SFX**

A mixture of live performance and digital sound editing, these sounds are produced by the artists of Foley studio to match their sounds to the on-screen visuals.

1. **Hard and Soft SFX**

Hard SFX synchronizes a visual to what’s happening in the picture while SFX indicates the location to the audience.

1. **Electronic SFX**

These sounds are generated by instruments that create electronic-sounding effects like electronic keyboards, synthesizers, or plug-ins.

## Part 2: How to Add Sound Effects in Final Cut Pro?

Cinematographic productions need well-balanced music and sound effects. Luckily, **Final Cut Pro comes with** built-in audio enhancement features and third-party Audio Units (AU) effects that allow users to add sound effects to their videos and manage all audio processing tasks.

You can add sound effects in your video with Final Cut Pro. Wonder how? Follow these steps:

**Step 1: Open Photos and Audio Sound Bar**

* In the top-left corner, there is a **Photos and Audio** Click on this button as shown in the figure below:
* Select the **Window** and **Go To** Either press Shift + Command + 1 or tap **Photos and Audio** from the dropdown menu

![sound-icon](https://images.wondershare.com/filmora/images/final-cut-pro/sound-icon.jpg)

**Step 2: Select the Sound Category**

* Choose a sound category or app from the Photos and Audio sidebar
* A list will appear contacting the audio clips in that specific category as shown in the figure below:
* You can find multiple music and sound clips in the Sound Effects category. The list also contains various apps you use on your Mac such as GarageBand, Music, and Logic Pro, etc.

![fcpx_sound](https://images.wondershare.com/filmora/images/final-cut-pro/fcpx_sound.jpg)

**Step 3: Select the Music or Sound to be added**

* Filter the items in the browser by using the pop-up menu. Go to **Music > Purchased** or select **Sound Effects >** **Final Cut Pro Sound Effects > Impacts & Crashes.**
* Preview your selected audio file by selecting it from the list and clicking the **Play**
* If you want to select multiple items, command-click each item individually.

**Step 4: Use the Selected Music or Audio**

* Drag your selected sound clip to the timeline or the sidebar
* Once the **Photos and Audio** sidebar has been replaced by the **Libraries** sidebar, you can add the selected audio or music files to an event. The **Photos and Audio** sidebar will reappear as you drag those files.
* Play the video to make sure sound effects have been successfully added

For enhanced playback experiences, all MP audio files are automatically transcoded to MOV audio files. However, you can also find the original MP3 files in the source media files section of Final Cut Pro. Besides, by adding mono audio clips to a stereo project, only the single mono audio will be plated in both left and right channels. You can view them in the stereo audio meters of your project.

## Part 5: Extensive Reading: What are Sound Effects and Why are they Important?

Sound is the most important aspect of video editing that engages audiences, evokes emotional responses, and connects people to what they’re seeing. A melodious sound helps the video editors deliver information and creatively and define the tone of their narrative.

Sound effects (SFX) refer to audio clips or sounds that are not part of the recoded video. They are added to movies, documentaries, video games, and even reality shows to invoke the viewers’ emotions and increase their interest in the video.

Similarly, the addition of sound effects increases the production value and creates a complete audience experience. If you want to elevate your video dramatically and make it magnetic, have to balance sound effects, silence, and music in such a way that they support each visual and every cut. Although audio cannot fix slipshod editing or amateur camera work, it becomes more crucial than video quality while you are trying to deliver a specific message in your video.

Professional video editors and filmmakers consider sound effects crucial to their video quality. A clear, melodious, and well-balanced audio adds depth to the visuals, evokes more emotions than the picture, and paints the audio picture of a particular setting.

Even silence, a powerful tool of the audio arsenal, speaks louder than the picture itself. Hence, balancing audio by adding sound effects can make your video stimulating, captivating, and emotional.

That's why a good editing tool always stocks a great number of sound effects for users, like **Filmora**. Click to download and take a look at all the effects in Filmora![](https://tools.techidaily.com/wondershare/filmora/download/)

**Conclusion**

You can create sound effects through self-recording or by downloading them from external resources.

 Mar 27, 2024• Proven solutions

We have been familiar with 1080p resolution for quite some years. However, HD has taken a new leap with ‘4k UHD’ offering higher than 1080p resolution. 4k UHD is mainly used in digital cinema with 4096x2160 as its pixel resolution or Ultra HD television with 3840× 2160 as its resolution. And we’ve compared 4K and 1080P before, and you can check the difference and get a clue [why 4K is better than 1080P](https://tools.techidaily.com/wondershare/filmora/download/).

The 4k technology allows the users to enjoy a very detailed screen of movies and videos which was not possible before. Though there are some 4K devices just as what we have rated before such as [4K TV](https://tools.techidaily.com/wondershare/filmora/download/), [4K smartphone](https://tools.techidaily.com/wondershare/filmora/download/), [4K monitor](https://tools.techidaily.com/wondershare/filmora/download/) and[4K camera](https://tools.techidaily.com/wondershare/filmora/download/) nowadays, 4k being relatively new, not all people have access to 4K devices and sometimes, and there are rather limited options to play 4K videos in a [4k video player](https://tools.techidaily.com/wondershare/filmora/download/). 4k being relatively new, there are not many devices that support 4k and rather limited options to play these videos in a 4k video player.

Since uploading 4K videos to online video converters may take much time, so in this article, we will share some of the best 4K video converters that allow you to convert 4K to 1080P resolution or other resolutions in MP4, MOV, MKV or other formats easily on Windows and Mac only.

While we’ve updated the list of best 4K video converters and add some more Video Converters that support 4K resolution. Both of them support Windows and Mac versions, and some of them are totally free to use while others may need to pay to convert 4K video footage.

### 4k vs 1080p

It is understood that 4k is much better than 1080p but the real question is, can you see the difference between 4k and 1080p?

**Can people say for sure that’s 4k and that’s 1080p?**

The answer is **Yes**, that there is no significant difference in both resolutions but while using a 65 inches screen the difference becomes clear, and as you go up in the sizes it gets more prominent.

![4kvs1080](https://images.wondershare.com/filmora/article-images/2022/09/4kvs1080.png)

Still, there are some pros and cons to both resolutions.

So do not wait…

Let us dive into the detail:

### What is a 4k?

As its name implies, it has almost 4000 pixels where it has **3840 x 2160px** or **4096 x 2160** horizontally and vertically and **16:9** is the Resolution. 4k presents clear and sharp graphics who loves to watch clear picture quality. It is commonly used in theaters and movies but it has also become common in residential use these days.

![4k](https://images.wondershare.com/filmora/article-images/2022/09/4k.png)

**Pros**

* When it comes to resolution 4k is always a better choice as it has 4 times more data than 1080p which means it has good picture quality. Its pixels are much smaller and it provides detailed information about the picture.
* It allows you to crop and scale without pixelating your video.
* It can be downscaled. Downscaling means converting the video to a low resolution and still achieving better video quality.
* If you are a professional video editor, you can charge more for 4k videos.  
**Cons**
* It occupies more space on your camera.
* It is harder to record.
* It takes up a big space in memory so it is harder to edit.
* There is limited content for 4k videos.  

### What is a1080p?  

As its name implies, it has almost 1000 pixels where it has **1920 x 1080px** horizontally and vertically and **16:9** is the Resolution. It is also known as Full HD or FHD.  
![1080](https://images.wondershare.com/filmora/article-images/2022/09/1080.png)  
**Pros**

* You can edit and shoot your videos on an average laptop or camera even you can use your cell phone.
* It is most preferable in shooting slow-motion videos.
* It has better features in terms of FPS (frame rate per second).
* It has a much better focus than 4k.
* Most people use 1080p laptops and devices and 4k video would also be converted into 1080p.
* 1080p is more economical if you have a low budget. **Cons**
* Its pixels are not too small and the images are not sharper.
* It gives a little low-quality video or image. The picture quality beats resolution.
* You cannot scale and crop your video as it will ruin your video. You can see the result in the screenshot below.  
![scale](https://images.wondershare.com/filmora/article-images/2022/09/scale.png)  
In the picture above, you can clearly observe that the 4k image has sharp results around the edges of the image and written text. Hence it is clearer than 1080p.

We have been familiar with 1080p resolution for quite some years. However, HD has taken a new leap with ‘4k UHD’ offering higher than 1080p resolution. 4k UHD is mainly used in digital cinema with 4096x2160 as its pixel resolution or Ultra HD television with 3840× 2160 as its resolution. And we’ve compared 4K and 1080P before, and you can check the difference and get a clue [why 4K is better than 1080P](https://tools.techidaily.com/wondershare/filmora/download/).

The 4k technology allows the users to enjoy a very detailed screen of movies and videos which was not possible before. Though there are some 4K devices just as what we have rated before such as [4K TV](https://tools.techidaily.com/wondershare/filmora/download/), [4K smartphone](https://tools.techidaily.com/wondershare/filmora/download/), [4K monitor](https://tools.techidaily.com/wondershare/filmora/download/) and[4K camera](https://tools.techidaily.com/wondershare/filmora/download/) nowadays, 4k being relatively new, not all people have access to 4K devices and sometimes, and there are rather limited options to play 4K videos in a [4k video player](https://tools.techidaily.com/wondershare/filmora/download/). 4k being relatively new, there are not many devices that support 4k and rather limited options to play these videos in a 4k video player.

Since uploading 4K videos to online video converters may take much time, so in this article, we will share some of the best 4K video converters that allow you to convert 4K to 1080P resolution or other resolutions in MP4, MOV, MKV or other formats easily on Windows and Mac only.

While we’ve updated the list of best 4K video converters and add some more Video Converters that support 4K resolution. Both of them support Windows and Mac versions, and some of them are totally free to use while others may need to pay to convert 4K video footage.

### 4k vs 1080p

It is understood that 4k is much better than 1080p but the real question is, can you see the difference between 4k and 1080p?

**Can people say for sure that’s 4k and that’s 1080p?**

The answer is **Yes**, that there is no significant difference in both resolutions but while using a 65 inches screen the difference becomes clear, and as you go up in the sizes it gets more prominent.

![4kvs1080](https://images.wondershare.com/filmora/article-images/2022/09/4kvs1080.png)

Still, there are some pros and cons to both resolutions.

So do not wait…

Let us dive into the detail:

### What is a 4k?

As its name implies, it has almost 4000 pixels where it has **3840 x 2160px** or **4096 x 2160** horizontally and vertically and **16:9** is the Resolution. 4k presents clear and sharp graphics who loves to watch clear picture quality. It is commonly used in theaters and movies but it has also become common in residential use these days.

![4k](https://images.wondershare.com/filmora/article-images/2022/09/4k.png)

**Pros**

* When it comes to resolution 4k is always a better choice as it has 4 times more data than 1080p which means it has good picture quality. Its pixels are much smaller and it provides detailed information about the picture.
* It allows you to crop and scale without pixelating your video.
* It can be downscaled. Downscaling means converting the video to a low resolution and still achieving better video quality.
* If you are a professional video editor, you can charge more for 4k videos.  
**Cons**
* It occupies more space on your camera.
* It is harder to record.
* It takes up a big space in memory so it is harder to edit.
* There is limited content for 4k videos.  

### What is a1080p?  

As its name implies, it has almost 1000 pixels where it has **1920 x 1080px** horizontally and vertically and **16:9** is the Resolution. It is also known as Full HD or FHD.  
![1080](https://images.wondershare.com/filmora/article-images/2022/09/1080.png)  
**Pros**

* You can edit and shoot your videos on an average laptop or camera even you can use your cell phone.
* It is most preferable in shooting slow-motion videos.
* It has better features in terms of FPS (frame rate per second).
* It has a much better focus than 4k.
* Most people use 1080p laptops and devices and 4k video would also be converted into 1080p.
* 1080p is more economical if you have a low budget. **Cons**
* Its pixels are not too small and the images are not sharper.
* It gives a little low-quality video or image. The picture quality beats resolution.
* You cannot scale and crop your video as it will ruin your video. You can see the result in the screenshot below.  
![scale](https://images.wondershare.com/filmora/article-images/2022/09/scale.png)  
In the picture above, you can clearly observe that the 4k image has sharp results around the edges of the image and written text. Hence it is clearer than 1080p.

We have been familiar with 1080p resolution for quite some years. However, HD has taken a new leap with ‘4k UHD’ offering higher than 1080p resolution. 4k UHD is mainly used in digital cinema with 4096x2160 as its pixel resolution or Ultra HD television with 3840× 2160 as its resolution. And we’ve compared 4K and 1080P before, and you can check the difference and get a clue [why 4K is better than 1080P](https://tools.techidaily.com/wondershare/filmora/download/).

The 4k technology allows the users to enjoy a very detailed screen of movies and videos which was not possible before. Though there are some 4K devices just as what we have rated before such as [4K TV](https://tools.techidaily.com/wondershare/filmora/download/), [4K smartphone](https://tools.techidaily.com/wondershare/filmora/download/), [4K monitor](https://tools.techidaily.com/wondershare/filmora/download/) and[4K camera](https://tools.techidaily.com/wondershare/filmora/download/) nowadays, 4k being relatively new, not all people have access to 4K devices and sometimes, and there are rather limited options to play 4K videos in a [4k video player](https://tools.techidaily.com/wondershare/filmora/download/). 4k being relatively new, there are not many devices that support 4k and rather limited options to play these videos in a 4k video player.

Since uploading 4K videos to online video converters may take much time, so in this article, we will share some of the best 4K video converters that allow you to convert 4K to 1080P resolution or other resolutions in MP4, MOV, MKV or other formats easily on Windows and Mac only.

While we’ve updated the list of best 4K video converters and add some more Video Converters that support 4K resolution. Both of them support Windows and Mac versions, and some of them are totally free to use while others may need to pay to convert 4K video footage.

### 4k vs 1080p

It is understood that 4k is much better than 1080p but the real question is, can you see the difference between 4k and 1080p?

**Can people say for sure that’s 4k and that’s 1080p?**

The answer is **Yes**, that there is no significant difference in both resolutions but while using a 65 inches screen the difference becomes clear, and as you go up in the sizes it gets more prominent.

![4kvs1080](https://images.wondershare.com/filmora/article-images/2022/09/4kvs1080.png)

Still, there are some pros and cons to both resolutions.

So do not wait…

Let us dive into the detail:

### What is a 4k?

As its name implies, it has almost 4000 pixels where it has **3840 x 2160px** or **4096 x 2160** horizontally and vertically and **16:9** is the Resolution. 4k presents clear and sharp graphics who loves to watch clear picture quality. It is commonly used in theaters and movies but it has also become common in residential use these days.

![4k](https://images.wondershare.com/filmora/article-images/2022/09/4k.png)

**Pros**

* When it comes to resolution 4k is always a better choice as it has 4 times more data than 1080p which means it has good picture quality. Its pixels are much smaller and it provides detailed information about the picture.
* It allows you to crop and scale without pixelating your video.
* It can be downscaled. Downscaling means converting the video to a low resolution and still achieving better video quality.
* If you are a professional video editor, you can charge more for 4k videos.  
**Cons**
* It occupies more space on your camera.
* It is harder to record.
* It takes up a big space in memory so it is harder to edit.
* There is limited content for 4k videos.  

### What is a1080p?  

As its name implies, it has almost 1000 pixels where it has **1920 x 1080px** horizontally and vertically and **16:9** is the Resolution. It is also known as Full HD or FHD.  
![1080](https://images.wondershare.com/filmora/article-images/2022/09/1080.png)  
**Pros**

* You can edit and shoot your videos on an average laptop or camera even you can use your cell phone.
* It is most preferable in shooting slow-motion videos.
* It has better features in terms of FPS (frame rate per second).
* It has a much better focus than 4k.
* Most people use 1080p laptops and devices and 4k video would also be converted into 1080p.
* 1080p is more economical if you have a low budget. **Cons**
* Its pixels are not too small and the images are not sharper.
* It gives a little low-quality video or image. The picture quality beats resolution.
* You cannot scale and crop your video as it will ruin your video. You can see the result in the screenshot below.  
![scale](https://images.wondershare.com/filmora/article-images/2022/09/scale.png)  
In the picture above, you can clearly observe that the 4k image has sharp results around the edges of the image and written text. Hence it is clearer than 1080p.
