For that, they use a number of video editing software that they get their hands on. To make your choice easier from thousands of software I am listing the top five in the business. My list includes Apple iMovie, Avidemux, Blender, HyperEngine AV Video Editing Software and last but not the least, Wondershare Filmora. Let us go over the specifications and shed light on the comparisons.

## Top 5 MTS Video Editing Software Recommended

#### 4\. [Blender](http://www.blender.org/download/)

 From 2002, Blender has been at the top of popularity charts for video editing. This is the popular video editor for 3D videos and it is commonly used for Rigging, Modeling, Texturing videos, animating, the simulation of smoke and water etc. This software is more suited for 3D video making. The popularity this software has can only be rivaled by very few in the market. The interface of Blender is very unique. Someone with no experience with Video Editing tool can have a hard time mastering it though. The video editing software is high end software which has features like:

* Advanced Simulation Tools.
* Advanced Level Animation Tools to create perfect animated bodies.
* Accumulates multiple scenes into one file.

![blender](https://images.wondershare.com/multimedia/blender01.jpg)

#### 5\. [HyperEngine AV](http://sourceforge.net/projects/hyperengine/files/latest/download?source=navbar)

 This little software is also a great one for video editing. One can easily use this to create slideshows. This is an award winning software from Arboretum Systems. The software has full source code integrated. One can edit the videos from his/her collection. Capturing video using the software is very easy. Audio processing, trackless document and many other edits are also possible using this piece of software. The important features of the software are:

* Dozens of effects are there to apply on a clip.
* FireWire DV camera is used to capture the images.
* Real time transition effects can be applied which are also automated.
* Trackless audio clips can be created through audio editing.

![hyper engine av](https://images.wondershare.com/multimedia/hyper-engine-av.jpg)

 With the basic idea about the software and the features, we can do a small comparison to see which one gets the edge when we talk about video editors. Let us compare all five software in a table for differences and performances.

| Features      | Apple iMovie | AvideMux        | Blender         | HyperEngine     | Wondershare Filmora                                  |
| ------------- | ------------ | --------------- | --------------- | --------------- | ---------------------------------------------------- |
| Speed         | None         | None            | None            | None            | Excellent (30X faster)                               |
| Editing Type  | Video/Audio  | Video/Audio     | 3D Video/Audio  | Video/Audio     | Video/Audio/Photos                                   |
| Mode Type     | Single       | Single          | Single          | Single          | Two Modes. Easy Editor and Full Featured Editor Mode |
| Compatibility | Mac          | Mac and Windows | Mac and Windows | Mac and Windows | Mac and Windows                                      |

 With the above comparison, it is safe to say that the top three video converters are Blender, HyperEngine AV and Wondershare. But Wondershare has a slight edge over the two in terms of space taken and mode variations. Due to its two modes, novice users as well as professionals can perform great editing of videos, photos and audios. It supports photo editing which is a great plus for the users. It works as a good downloader and converter too. That is definitely a plus for all who use this software. Again, the compatibility is a great factor working towards its favor.

| Features      | Apple iMovie | AvideMux        | Blender         | HyperEngine     | Wondershare Filmora                                  |
| ------------- | ------------ | --------------- | --------------- | --------------- | ---------------------------------------------------- |
| Speed         | None         | None            | None            | None            | Excellent (30X faster)                               |
| Editing Type  | Video/Audio  | Video/Audio     | 3D Video/Audio  | Video/Audio     | Video/Audio/Photos                                   |
| Mode Type     | Single       | Single          | Single          | Single          | Two Modes. Easy Editor and Full Featured Editor Mode |
| Compatibility | Mac          | Mac and Windows | Mac and Windows | Mac and Windows | Mac and Windows                                      |

 With the above comparison, it is safe to say that the top three video converters are Blender, HyperEngine AV and Wondershare. But Wondershare has a slight edge over the two in terms of space taken and mode variations. Due to its two modes, novice users as well as professionals can perform great editing of videos, photos and audios. It supports photo editing which is a great plus for the users. It works as a good downloader and converter too. That is definitely a plus for all who use this software. Again, the compatibility is a great factor working towards its favor.

## Part 1: What Is the Difference Between OIS and EIS?

The majority of individuals favor OIS over EIS. A hardware approach is always preferable to a software platform since EIS is essentially a repair solution that causes picture resolution deterioration by cutting it and estimating what this would seem like if it were steady. OIS also performs better in low-light conditions. The best video stabilizer app for android is the one that incorporates both approaches.

Moreover, OIS and EIS both hold a significant reputation for video stabilization. And not much, but some people prefer Electronic Image Stabilization (EIS) to stabilize their video as it converts the optical signal to a digital one. You will get a better understanding of both the stabilization technologies after reading what's written below:

**Electronic Image Stabilization (EIS)**

Electronic image stabilization operates on a fundamentally different premise, with the problem being tackled at the coding layer after the visible light has been transformed to a digital signal.

Users can utilize video stabilizer applications to solve this issue. Using these applications, users may quickly smooth out shaky areas of a video on their Android smartphones. However, finding an excellent **Android Video Stabilizer** is still a hard task due to the number of applications present in the market.

02 [Best Free Video Stabilizer Apps for Android](#part2)

## Part 1: What Is the Difference Between OIS and EIS?

The majority of individuals favor OIS over EIS. A hardware approach is always preferable to a software platform since EIS is essentially a repair solution that causes picture resolution deterioration by cutting it and estimating what this would seem like if it were steady. OIS also performs better in low-light conditions. The best video stabilizer app for android is the one that incorporates both approaches.

Moreover, OIS and EIS both hold a significant reputation for video stabilization. And not much, but some people prefer Electronic Image Stabilization (EIS) to stabilize their video as it converts the optical signal to a digital one. You will get a better understanding of both the stabilization technologies after reading what's written below:

**Electronic Image Stabilization (EIS)**

Electronic image stabilization operates on a fundamentally different premise, with the problem being tackled at the coding layer after the visible light has been transformed to a digital signal.

**Optical Image Stabilization (OIS)**

The picture is stabilized with this approach by altering the optical path of the detector. Because this is real-time correction, no image change or degradation occurs. The lens component is rotated such that it is parallel to the picture plane.

1. **Foley SFX**

A mixture of live performance and digital sound editing, these sounds are produced by the artists of Foley studio to match their sounds to the on-screen visuals.

## Part 5: Extensive Reading: What are Sound Effects and Why are they Important?

Sound is the most important aspect of video editing that engages audiences, evokes emotional responses, and connects people to what they’re seeing. A melodious sound helps the video editors deliver information and creatively and define the tone of their narrative.

Sound effects (SFX) refer to audio clips or sounds that are not part of the recoded video. They are added to movies, documentaries, video games, and even reality shows to invoke the viewers’ emotions and increase their interest in the video.

Similarly, the addition of sound effects increases the production value and creates a complete audience experience. If you want to elevate your video dramatically and make it magnetic, have to balance sound effects, silence, and music in such a way that they support each visual and every cut. Although audio cannot fix slipshod editing or amateur camera work, it becomes more crucial than video quality while you are trying to deliver a specific message in your video.

Professional video editors and filmmakers consider sound effects crucial to their video quality. A clear, melodious, and well-balanced audio adds depth to the visuals, evokes more emotions than the picture, and paints the audio picture of a particular setting.

Even silence, a powerful tool of the audio arsenal, speaks louder than the picture itself. Hence, balancing audio by adding sound effects can make your video stimulating, captivating, and emotional.

That's why a good editing tool always stocks a great number of sound effects for users, like **Filmora**. Click to download and take a look at all the effects in Filmora![](https://tools.techidaily.com/wondershare/filmora/download/)

**Conclusion**

Sound effects are external audio files added to the videos to make them look interesting and worth watching. A perfect balance of sound, music, and silence allows the filmmakers to define the tone of their narrative and deliver their message creatively.

You can create sound effects through self-recording or by downloading them from external resources.

Both these applications are user-friendly and possess a huge library of a variety of sound effects and music files. Besides, their advanced features allow you to naturally add sound effects without affecting the video quality.

Suppose you have recorded a cinematic video of a beach in the evening visualizing the sunset and a few birds flying in the sky. Everything looks perfect except the audio, which seems to be fluctuating and breaking at some points. How would you address this challenge?

The best solution to this problem is adding sound effects, which can make your video more interesting and adorable. Setting the frequency of audio with on-screen visuals will invoke the viewers’ emotions and attach them to the scene.

Read this article to learn how to add sound effects to your video with Final Cut Pro.

![SoundEffect](https://images.wondershare.com/filmora/images/final-cut-pro/SoundEffect.jpg)

## Part 1: What are Different Types of Sound Effects?

Sound effects have four major types:

1. **Ambiance SFX**

These sounds fill the screen space to create a virtual sense of an environment or location such as the clattering sound of dishes in a restaurant or the sound of engines on a highway.

1. **Foley SFX**

A mixture of live performance and digital sound editing, these sounds are produced by the artists of Foley studio to match their sounds to the on-screen visuals.

1. **Hard and Soft SFX**

Hard SFX synchronizes a visual to what’s happening in the picture while SFX indicates the location to the audience.

1. **Electronic SFX**

These sounds are generated by instruments that create electronic-sounding effects like electronic keyboards, synthesizers, or plug-ins.

## Part 2: How to Add Sound Effects in Final Cut Pro?

Cinematographic productions need well-balanced music and sound effects. Luckily, **Final Cut Pro comes with** built-in audio enhancement features and third-party Audio Units (AU) effects that allow users to add sound effects to their videos and manage all audio processing tasks.

You can add sound effects in your video with Final Cut Pro. Wonder how? Follow these steps:

**Step 1: Open Photos and Audio Sound Bar**

* In the top-left corner, there is a **Photos and Audio** Click on this button as shown in the figure below:

## Part 5: Extensive Reading: What are Sound Effects and Why are they Important?

Sound is the most important aspect of video editing that engages audiences, evokes emotional responses, and connects people to what they’re seeing. A melodious sound helps the video editors deliver information and creatively and define the tone of their narrative.

Sound effects (SFX) refer to audio clips or sounds that are not part of the recoded video. They are added to movies, documentaries, video games, and even reality shows to invoke the viewers’ emotions and increase their interest in the video.

Similarly, the addition of sound effects increases the production value and creates a complete audience experience. If you want to elevate your video dramatically and make it magnetic, have to balance sound effects, silence, and music in such a way that they support each visual and every cut. Although audio cannot fix slipshod editing or amateur camera work, it becomes more crucial than video quality while you are trying to deliver a specific message in your video.

Professional video editors and filmmakers consider sound effects crucial to their video quality. A clear, melodious, and well-balanced audio adds depth to the visuals, evokes more emotions than the picture, and paints the audio picture of a particular setting.

Even silence, a powerful tool of the audio arsenal, speaks louder than the picture itself. Hence, balancing audio by adding sound effects can make your video stimulating, captivating, and emotional.

That's why a good editing tool always stocks a great number of sound effects for users, like **Filmora**. Click to download and take a look at all the effects in Filmora![](https://tools.techidaily.com/wondershare/filmora/download/)

**Conclusion**

Sound effects are external audio files added to the videos to make them look interesting and worth watching. A perfect balance of sound, music, and silence allows the filmmakers to define the tone of their narrative and deliver their message creatively.

You can create sound effects through self-recording or by downloading them from external resources. To add sound effects to your video, use professional video-editing software like Final Cut Pro or Filmora. Both these applications are user-friendly and possess a huge library of a variety of sound effects and music files. Besides, their advanced features allow you to naturally add sound effects without affecting the video quality.
